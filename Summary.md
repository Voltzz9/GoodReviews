## <u>GoodBooks Reviews Analysis</u>
### 1. <u>**Introduction**</u>
Our analysis uses a variety of natural language processing techniques we learned in class to analyze book reviews from the GoodBooks dataset. The main goals are to generate useful text like summaries, book descriptions, and star rating prediction, as well as to extract valuable information from user evaluations. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), text generation, sentiment analysis, and summarization are some of the methods employed.

### 2. <u>**Ideas and Application**</u>
Our aim is to automate the analysis and synthesis of book reviews to make it easier to derive insights from books. The main ideas include:
- **Scraping**: Using R and Python to collect our data in an ethical and non-invasive way.
- **Preprocessing**: Preparing our scraped data for analysis in R.
- **EDA**: Exploring relationships and distributions of our predictors.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the general sentiment of each review to classify it as positive, negative, or neutral for further interpretation.
- **Topic Analysis**: Trying to understand common themes or trends amongst positive and negative reviews respectively.
- **Summarization of Reviews**: Generating concise summaries for individual reviews, followed by a final summary that represents the overall opinion of readers.
- **Book Description Generation**: Creating a book description using text generation models based on the final summary.
- **Star Rating Prediction**: Predicting the star ratings which involve transforming the text data into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization and training a neural network model to classify the text into different star categories. Also includes attempts at regularisation to prevent overfitting.
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Analyzing reviews based on specific aspects, such as plot, characters, or writing style, to provide a detailed sentiment evaluation for each aspect. Includes a simple and advanced approach.

### 3. <u>**Implementation**</u>
The implementation is divided into several stages - using R for EDA and basic sentiment analysis, using transformer-based models from Hugging Face's Transformers library and neural network models for multiple tasks:


1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis with the NRC and Bing lexicons. Correlation detection between sentiment scores and star ratings along with visualization. All done in R.
2. **Summarization of Reviews**:
   - Individual reviews are summarized using transformers with the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model, then an encoder-decoder approach with the pre-trained Sentence-BERT model. These models are fine-tuned for summarization tasks, generating concise versions of the original reviews.
   - A final summary is generated by clustering the most representative sentences from individual summaries.
3. **Book Description Generation**:
   - Text generation model BART is used with a prompt as an attempt to generate a 3rd person book description. The prompt-based text generation helps in making the description more engaging.
4. **Star Rating Prediction**:
   - A sequential neural network is implemented using TensorFlow Keras to predict star ratings based on the review text. The model is trained on a labeled dataset where the input features are the encoded review text and the target labels are the star ratings.
5. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**:
   - For ABSA, we used InstructABSA, a model that achieves high performance on benchmark datasets like SemEval 2014 Task 4. The model provides fine-grained sentiment analysis for different aspects of the book, such as plot, characters, and writing style, offering a detailed understanding of each review's content.

### 4. <u>**Results and Findings**</u>
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Most reviews tend to be positive, reflecting a general tendency for people to write reviews for books they enjoyed. However, some genres had more polarized sentiments (such as horror).
- **Summarization**: The generated summaries effectively captured the main points of each review, helping to distill lengthy reviews into concise reviews.
- **Book Descriptions**: Text generation for book descriptions was successful in producing engaging content, although fine-tuning the prompt was necessary to ensure descriptions sounded more objective. One of the biggest issues was 3rd person generation, which wasn't obtained consistently.
- **Star Prediction**: The sequential model demonstrated inconsistent results - the accuracy was low and the models showed signs of overfitting. Regularisation methods did not yield much better results. There were some promising results when inputting shorter reviews.
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: ABSA provided a nuanced view of reviews by highlighting specific aspects praised or criticized by readers. For instance, certain books received high praise for plot development but were critiqued for character depth.

### 5. <u>**Ethical Considerations**</u>
- No personal data was scrapped.
- Data is used exclusively for demonstrating the NLP and Deep Learning methods we were taught in class.
- In implementing our web scraper we made sure to use time.sleep() in order to not overload the servers for [goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com) with constant requests from out scraper.
- We also made sure to not bypass and security measures that were in place to prevent web scrapers from accessing the website. We only scraped the data that is publicly available.

### 6. <u>**Conclusions**</u>
Our attempt shows how well sophisticated NLP approaches work for automating the examination of book reviews. A thorough grasp of reader attitudes may be obtained by combining sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis, summarization, and text production. The methods used not only help in summarizing large volumes of text but also in generating new content, such as book descriptions, that can be useful for readers, authors, and publishers. This entire process is applicable to many different review contexts (granted to data is easily available).
