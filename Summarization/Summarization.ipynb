Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it\\'s thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that\\'s grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell.'"
