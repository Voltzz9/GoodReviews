       "'First of all, this entire book is set in bold. I don\\'t know what crazy crazyman let that through the gate at Penguin but I just felt I had to point it out right away. It\\'s still worth reading. 4 essays and 3 pictorial essays. Really interesting stuff cutting away some of the bullshit associated with our appreciation of art. It seems like museums are doing a lot of things wrong as well as right. Chapter on oil-painting was particularly interesting but it was the last one about advertising (or \"publicity\" as it\\'s exclusively referred to in this book) that has me thinking. Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it\\'s thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that\\'s grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell.'"

       "'I am not the audience for this book, mainly because I\\'ve already read and more or less digested the handful of essays and ideas on which it is based. The seven chapters break down fairly simply. 1: Benjamin\\'s \\'Work of Art\\'--the ability to reproduce images alters the way we encounter works of art. This seems reasonable. Nobody gets to see a Giotto without having seen a reproduction first, except someone who has no interest in the Giotto in the first place. But Berger et al* go a step further: we need to use the fact that we encounter works of art differently to undermine the ruling class\\'s privilege and the \"specialized experts who are the clerks of the nostalgia of a ruling class in decline.\" That\\'s on page 32. Part of me, a large part, laments the fact that you\\'d never get that published today, not even on a website. Another part of me laments the stupidity of intellectuals who put their faith in the inherent goodness of The People. The People does not have a good track record when it comes to art appreciation. That\\'s not to say that people can\\'t learn to appreciate art, only that We are no better and no worse than the ruling class was. We need to learn, we need to be taught, you can\\'t do that if you assume that We are inherently able to do the right thing. 2 & 3: Women are depicted differently from men, and, frankly, not in ways that are healthy for anyone, but particularly not for women. I agree. Which makes it breathtaking to see the authors get so many things wrong, either intentionally (cutting short the bible verse in which God punishes Eve *and Adam*); stupidly (non-Western art forms show women as active participants in sex, so that are isn\\'t morally dubious); or in ways that are, ahem, temporally bound (\"Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion.\" Seventies!). 5: Oil paintings are bourgeois and generally not morally okay. Holbein\\'s \\'Ambassadors\\' is read as an example of this; the incredible distorted skull in the painting is the exception which proves the rule of oil paintings rather than, you know, showing that oil paintings can be self-critical, as are most good artworks of any kind. In general, the lesson of this book is that all art is bad for you, except the pieces that the authors of this book like. They like pieces by artists who can plausibly be turned into radicals, because only radicals can be interesting (Franz Hals; William Blake). They don\\'t discuss the 20th century at all (I know they know that twentieth century art exists; perhaps, as good Benjaminian Marxists, they don\\'t like abstraction or difficulty). They\\'re also very uncomfortable with religious art, and want to group, e.g., Ambrosius Benson\\'s Mary Magdalene with the absurd and/or pornographic Magdalene of later times, rather than admitting the rather obvious differences (Benson\\'s is rich, but not, how can I put this... naked and disheveled.) Since the authors have a hard time saying what they actually like (vs. what they suspect is oppressive), you get idiocies like this: Rembrandt\\'s famous late portrait shows a man for whom \"all has gone except a sense of the question of existence, of existence as a question.\" A little thought would show that this is the sort of conservative pablum Great Artists have been serving up for generations. 6 & 7: Advertizing uses art to make you think you want things you don\\'t want and that you can get them, so you don\\'t need to think about what you really want, e.g., more time away from the office. This is true. In sum: I was sucked in by the idea that this was a book about understanding art. It is not. It is critical theory for high-school readers. Good for what it is, but extremely narrow in scope, and quite harmful for anyone who swallows it whole rather than taking a few minutes to worry away at its assumptions. Harmful because those who accept it will say silly things, and because those who read it and reject it out of hand (due to the rhetoric, bad arguments, or conceptual confusion) won\\'t be challenged to, you know, care about other people. * Humorous aspect of this book: it makes a big deal about how it was written by a group of people, because, you know, individuals are bad, and groups are good. You\\'ll note that the book is sold as a book by John Berger. You can draw the conclusion.'"

       "\"He was just Robert to Trevor, someone who was nice to him on Sundays and Christmas holidays, and on all those days when he was not giving in to hungry black women his Swiss, precious, and fair sperm. If you have a chance to listen to the book, instead of reading it, I recommend this experience highly. Noah's love and respect for his mother & the way she raised him shines through on nearly every page. Eye-opening and perspective changing in a way that's funny and deeply vulnerable, you'll feel educated and entertained at the same time. Trevor Noah is a remarkable person. I LOVED this book! I liked reading about his childhood. But Trevor Noah expertly maneuvers through different scenes--much of it due to his mixed background--and explains so much history with apartheid and the different tribes and the colored thing and life in the townships and life in the homeland and so on... South Africa does of course have it's problems, yet after this book one has to be at least more empathetic. . This sets the tone for a life full of bizarre moments due to race. For an enhanced experience, I highly recommend the audiobook version. Born a Crime is about growing up in South Africa: living under apartheid when his existence was evidence of a crime, life after apartheid, the deep bond between a mother and son, the unique challenges of growing up mixed race, and living with an abusive stepfather. I learned a lot about apartheid and I learned a lot about South Africa. I was so captivated by everything he said. So many of Trevor's stories revolved around his mother, and with good reason - she raised him alone (mostly), and so she was a huge influence on and guiding force of his life. Moved out of the house at the age of 17 because of his step-dad and was even jailed for using a fake license plate. I recommend this book to absolutely everyone, I got sooo much more than I expected from it. His relationship with his mother was a delight to read. reading this made me realize that i am grievously uneducated on apartheid. Imagine being born from a black mother and a white father in a country where interracial relationships were against the law. In the memoir, there are many things that I did not understand. It was fascinating learning about his life growing up as a mixed race child in pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa. I was instantly intrigued by his story, not only because of this unique perspective but also because he is such a wonderful storyteller.\""

The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation.

      "Zero to One by Peter Thiel asserts this position. It got a bit repetitive for me, but the crux of the book is very profound. Unfortunately, we are delivering faster and faster things that our customers often do not need. Measuring (validate hypotheses) as we build is not easy, as it can bring much waste when startups get trapped in the perfectionism paradigm. Loved this book since it contained a lot of highly informative and applicable concepts that can be adopted in a startup in order to maximize the odds of success.\n",

Her heart’s in the right place and she cares for every single person she holds dearly with such deep devotion it nearly rips her apart at times (which I strongly relate to). It nearly crushed me when Anne fell in love with Green Gables only to find that she must surely be turned away and carted straight back to the orphanage. I wish I'd read it sooner, though I'm glad to have finally read it. But never forgetting the days of blissful youth, lingering still as she matures.\n",

Chernow relates that \"Only once did Burr betray any misgivings about killing Hamilton. He really made the Founding Fathers seem as they are alive. He also foreshadowed to the duel WAY too much\"\n",

This probably isn't the best book for a non-Christian or someone who has been away from church a while. If we lose sight of that and exchange it with a focus on external obedience to a law we can't obey we will be forever chasing a salvation that's already been offered.\n",

From the beginning, the premise seemed promising, and for the most part, it delivers on its intriguing concept. The plot revolves around a futuristic world where society grapples with the boundaries of artificial intelligence, humanity, and survival—concepts that have always fascinated me. The world-building is impressive, with detailed landscapes and a unique societal structure that keeps you hooked initially. The author has clearly put a lot of thought into constructing the futuristic world, and it shows in the vivid descriptions and creative technologies. However, while the world-building is rich, the characters left much to be desired. The protagonist, Lila, felt underdeveloped. I found myself frustrated at several points because her motivations were either unclear or inconsistent. In the beginning, she starts off as a strong, determined character, but midway through, her actions seem erratic and her growth stagnates. The dialogue, too, felt stilted at times, making it hard to connect with the characters emotionally. There were a few moments where I felt the conversations between key characters were forced, almost like they were inserted to explain plot points rather than feeling organic.On the flip side, I have to give credit where it’s due—the pacing of the story is solid for the most part. There are intense moments where you’re on the edge of your seat, particularly during the battle scenes. These scenes were written with such vivid detail that I could easily imagine them playing out in a movie. The action sequences are well thought out, and they definitely add excitement to the narrative. That being said, there were also moments where the pacing lagged, especially in the middle sections. Some chapters felt like filler, dragging on with unnecessary exposition and side plots that didn’t add much to the overarching story.\"]\n",

    "Books are often reviewed based on certain aspects, for example, a fiction book on the plot, characters or maybe the setting. Readers have diverse tastes and some may prioritise plot over characters or maybe emotion over humour. We therefore attempt an Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of our book reviews. This can help identify strengths and can guide authors and publishers towards understanding the reader's perspective. By highlighting both positive and negative aspects, we can propose a balanced critique with a well-rounded perspective. This also enhances decision-making for readers who do not want to sift through hundreds of wordy reviews to gauge a sentiment on a specific aspect of the book."

       "'I\\'d rate this 4.5 stars. I was really surprised when Trevor Noah was named Jon Stewart\\'s successor on The Daily Show . I inherently knew that they wouldn\\'t pick someone with a sense of humor and style identical to Stewart\\'s, but I felt that Noah was so different that his selection meant the show would have a really different feel, which might not appeal to long-time fans of the show. But I always root for the underdog, so as he was getting savaged by critics and fans in his first few days on the job, I kept hoping he\\'d be able to tough it out and show the stuff—comedic and otherwise—of which he was made. After reading , I realize that I needn\\'t have worried about Trevor Noah. For a child growing up in South Africa in the last days of, and the tumult following apartheid, he faced crises far greater than dissatisfied fans. And if he could be raised during such a crazily illogical time in a country where more violence, racism, and mistreatment went unreported than caught the media\\'s eye, he\\'d have no problem skewering the insanity of our political system, especially leading into the election of 2016!! \"On February 20, 1984, my mother checked into Hillbrow Hospital for a scheduled C-section delivery. Estranged from her family, pregnant by a man she could not be seen with in public, she was alone. The doctors took her up to the delivery room, cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white, half-black child who violated any number of laws, statutes, and regulations—I was born a crime.\" Born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, Noah literally spent his earliest days hiding indoors. His parents, who never married, couldn\\'t be seen together, and because his mother looked so different than he did, she couldn\\'t walk through the streets with him, because at any moment someone might accuse her of kidnapping another person\\'s child. Yet while their lives dealt with crushing poverty, violence, and racism from all sides, his deeply religious mother never let anything bother her, or stop her from raising her son to know he was loved, and to know that he truly could accomplish anything he wanted, despite all of the obstacles in his way. \"She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.\" provides a first-hand account of the last days of apartheid and its aftermath, and what it was like to grow up as a mixed-race child, where he wasn\\'t white enough to be considered white, nor was he black enough to be considered black. While at times this had its advantages, for the most part, it left him on the outside looking in, having to handle everything on his own, fight his own battles, struggle to find people who genuinely liked him for who he was and not the novelty of his skin color, and rebel against a mother who only wanted him to behave. If you go into this book expecting to laugh hysterically because of Noah\\'s day job, think again. While the book does include some of the wry humor that has begun endearing him to fans, this is an emotional, brutal, and educational story of a life which flourished despite the odds stacked against it. This is a book about growing up in a culture of poverty and crime, and how easy it was to get caught up in that, especially when it was one of the only ways to make money and be able to feed, clothe, and enjoy yourself. It\\'s also a book about fear, how it motivates you, how it paralyzes you, and how it threatens to take away the one thing you cherish more than any other. More than anything, though, this is a book about the unwavering love of a mother for a child she chose to have. She knew it would be difficult raising her son in the age of apartheid, and in fact, she had no idea when he was born that it would end anytime soon. But Noah was a remarkable child, and while he exasperated, frightened, and upset his mother from time to time, she knew he would accomplish great things one day (as soon as he stopped putting cornrows in his hair and hanging out with those awful hoodlums he called friends). I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about apartheid, which I really didn\\'t know much about. Noah is a good writer, and delivered his narrative much as I\\'ve heard him deliver his lines on . This is a funny, thought-provoking, and emotional book, although I felt that some of his anecdotes went on a little too long, while others didn\\'t go on long enough. I also would have liked to have learned how he went from his upbringing in South Africa to one day hosting an acclaimed television show—other than passing mentions of things he did, I have no idea how he made the leap. I\\'ve heard some people say that the audio version of this book is brilliant because Noah reads it himself, but if you read the print/digital version, you can still hear his voice through his words. Noah\\'s story is a lesson of the inequities of the past, and a warning for what is still possible to happen again in our world. But this isn\\'t heavy-handed; it\\'s fun, insightful, and very compelling. See all of my reviews at , and see my list of the best books I read in 2016 at .'"
