Book Title,Review Text
The Shining,"If you had not read The Shining already, the 2013 publication of Doctor Sleep, the sequel, presented an opportunity to revisit one of the best ghost stories of our time, a perfect justification for stepping through those bat-wing doors for the first time. It has been a lifetime since I read for the first time, over thirty years ago. I enjoyed it then for its effectiveness in telling a scary, no, a very scary story. Reading it now is colored, as is all of life, by our accumulation (or lack of accumulation) of experience. We see, or appreciate colors, textures, shapes, structures, and feelings with more experienced, educated eyes. We have seen, or are at least aware of real world things that are scarier than any fictional spectres. So, what does it look like through old, cloudy lenses? It remains a very scary story. The things that stand out for me now are not so much the deader rising up out of a bathtub to pursue a curious child, although that is still pretty creepy, or the mobile topiary, which still works pretty well at making the hair on one’s neck and arms stand at attention. But King was using the haunted house trope to look at more personal demons. And those shine through more clearly now. He had some drinking issues at the time he wrote the book, when he was 30, and concern about that is major here. Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, no question. He also has issues with anger management, not that the little shit he clocks while teaching at a New England prep school didn’t have it coming. He did. But one cannot do that to a student, however deserving, and expect to remain employed for long. His little boy, however, most certainly did not deserve a broken arm. Jack is very remorseful, and wants to make things right. He manages to get a gig taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter. It will offer him a chance to get something right after a string of getting things wrong, offer a chance to save his marriage, and offer an opportunity to work on his unfinished play. Risky? Sure. But a gamble worth taking. And his wife, Wendy, agrees, despite having serious misgivings. There are no attractive alternatives. Of course, we all know that the Overlook is not your typical residence. Odd things happen, sounds are heard, thoughts from somewhere outside find their way into your mind. Jack is targeted, and boy is he vulnerable. But five-year-old Danny is the real key here. He is the proud possessor of an unusual talent, the of the book’s title. Danny can not only do a bit of mind-reading, he can also see things that other people cannot. And for a little guy he has a huge talent. He also has an invisible friend named Tony with whom only he can communicate. It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran. By the way, the hotel is based on a real-world place, the Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado. And the Overlook’s spooky room 217 was inspired by the supposedly at the Stanley. The room number was changed in the film to 237, at the request of the Timberline hotel, which was used for exterior shots. There is so much that differentiates Kubrick’s film from the book that they are almost entirely different entities. The differences do require a bit of attention here. First, and foremost, the book of is about the disintegration of a family due to alcoholism and anger issues. How a child survives in a troubled family is key. The film is pretty much pure spook house, well-done spook house, but solely spook house, nonetheless, IMHO. There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time. You have to read the book to get that. Jack is a victim, as much as Wendy and Danny. You would never get that from the slobbering Jack of the film. The maze in the book was pretty cool, right? I liked it too, but it does not exist in the book. I believe it was put in to replace the talented topiary, which is the definition of a bad trade. There is significant violence in the book that never made its way into Kubrick’s film, but which very much raises a specter of domestic violence that is terrorizing real people living in real horror stories. There are a few lesser elements. Jack wielded a roque mallet, not an axe. Danny is not interrupted in his travels through the corridors by Arbus-like twin sisters. And the sisters in question are not even twins. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. An interesting film, for sure, but not really the most faithful interpretation of the book. King saw that a film that more closely reflected what he had written reached TV screens in 1997, with a six-hour mini-series version. The opening shot was filmed on the in Montana’s Glacier National Park in Montana. I have had the pleasure (7 times in one visit) and recommend the drive wholeheartedly. It is a pretty narrow road though, so you will have to drive carefully. Bring along the appropriate musical media for the best effect, Wendy Carlos’s , and dress warmly. It was below freezing when I reached the top of the road, in August. Some exteriors for Kubrick’s film were shot at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon. I visited but did not stay there back in 2008. Sadly I do not have any decent personal photos from the place. I can report, though, on a bit of kitsch. There is a place in the hotel where an ax is lodged in a block of wood, with HEEEEERE’s JOHNNY on the ax, a tourist photo-op. And yes, I did. Sadly, or luckily, the shot did not come out well, so you will be spared. Back to the book, Danny’s talent is a two-edged sword. He is afflicted with seeing more than anyone his age should have to see, but on the other hand, he has a tool he can use to try to save them all. Whether he can or not is a core tension element here. King is fond of placing his stories in literary context. He peppers the text with references to various relevant books and authors. I expect these are meant to let us know his influences. Horace Walpole, author of , a Gothic classic, is mentioned, as is Shirley Jackson, of fame. King had used a quote from this book in . A family saga rich with death and destruction, is mentioned as are some more contemporary items, like , the idealized antithesis to the Torrance Family, and novelist Frank Norris. The primary literary reference here is Poe’s , which is cited many times. There had been a costume ball back in hotel’s history and it is the impending climax of that party, the unmasking, that looms here. And toss in nods to and for good measure. King often includes writers in his work, avatars for himself. Jack Torrance is a writer as well as a teacher. The play that Jack is writing undergoes a transformation that mirrors Jack’s own. In fact, there is a fair bit or mirroring going on here. Jack’s affection for his father as a kid was as strong as Danny's is for him. His father was an abusive alcoholic. While Jack is not (yet) the monster his father was, he is also an alcoholic with abusive tendencies. He’s right. I have had the pleasure and I know. Wendy gets some attention as well, as we learn a bit about her mother, and see Wendy’s fear that she has inherited elements of her mother’s awfulness. Not everything shines here. There are times when five-year-old Danny seems much older than his tender years, even given his extraordinary circumstances. It struck me as surprising that there is no mention of anyone suggesting that maybe Jack might attend an AA meeting. But these are like single dead pixels on a large screen. If you want to read horror tales that are straight up scare’ems, there are plenty in the world. But if you appreciate horror that offers underlying emotional content, and I know you do, my special gift tells me that is a brilliant example of how a master illuminates the darkness.

The Shining,"This was my 4th-time reading The Shining. You read that correctly, the 4th-time. I'm aware rereading isn't for everyone, but I am a huge supporter and fan of rereading, especially tried and true favorites. I know a lot of people feel it is a waste of time, but for me, when a story is special enough to you, each time with it is like a whole new experience. That's exactly how I feel every time I open the pages of this book. Additionally, I feel like where I am at in my life plays a huge role in what I take out of a reading experience. For example, the first time I read this, I was in high school. You better believe that 14-year old Meg walked away from this having picked up on different things than 44-year old Meg does, reading it now. My experiences have shown me that rereading allows me to focus on different areas of any particular story. This time around, for me, I felt myself really drawn to the private thoughts and emotions of this cast of characters. Jack's experience, in particular, as he struggles with the position he finds himself in, his loitering addiction and the love for his family, hit me hard this time. Instead of seeing his horrible aspects front and center, I thought more about what was going on with him internally. There were moments of clarity for him, when he could see beyond the fog of the hotel's power, moments where he cherished his son and wife, but they would slip away like mist. It made my heart ache for the whole family. This experience also reiterated for me how much I love Wendy and Hallorann. They got played dirty in the movie adaptation and we all know it. Not by the actors, the acting was fantastic, but yeah, they feel like completely different people in the book, IMO. Again, I was beyond impressed with some of the scenes in this still having the ability to scare the shit out of me, even after all these years. The perfect example would be the first time Jack tries to trim the topiary. That freaking scene gets my pulse racing every time! I also felt like I paid more attention to the history of The Overlook this time through; like when Jack is looking into it. I really felt focused in those sections and loved being reminded of its intensely lurid history. Finally, I would just give all the stars in the universe, yet again, to King's sense of place with this one. His ability to transform a hotel into an actual character in the story is just a masterpiece. It's basically the standard to which I compare atmosphere in all other stories. I'm so glad I took the time to reread this. It was exactly what I needed to re-energize my reading. You better believe, this won't be the last time either! Here's the thing, July hasn't been the best reading month for me. I've had a lot of 2-to-3-star books. I'm frustrated. I'm getting disgruntled and burnt out on it honestly. I have never been in a reading slump before, but I definitely feel myself drifting into that territory... I feel like in an effort to keep that from happening, I am going to reread one of my top-3 favorite books of all-time. If anyone can shake me out of this funk, it's Jack Torrance. I hear the fourth times a charm!!! Hi. Hello! It's me again, with another book you should consider picking up, if you haven't read it yet. is my second favorite book of all time. A true . I have read it a few times and it gets me EVERY. DAMN. TIME. This is one of the most atmospheric books I have , with , ultimately becoming a character in its own right. There are so many chilling moments from crazed topiary animals, to haunted elevators, and evil playground equipment. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Read it. Read it now! is best read on a cold, windy night, when you are home alone and there is the slight possibility that you may lose electricity. Candles burning are a must for this one!"
The Shining,"i- i don't even know what to say that hasn't already been said about this but lemme give it a shot. god DAMN this is king at his best. i know, i know, ""kat that is so cliche. couldn't you have picked a less popular king book to stan?"" i guess not, but hear me out. 1. first of all, i love a good old fashioned haunted house story and that's exactly what this is. the slow progression of madness that overtook jack and the introduction of new ghosts (or hallucinations, whatever you decide) was INCREDIBLE. not to mention the thing that i think king writes best is the feeling of confinement, and what's more confining than being snowed into a haunted hotel that literally wants you dead?? oh right, nothing. 2. the characterization!!! ah! the way that king wrote these characters was just *chefs kiss* not only did i care about danny, wendy, and (sometimes) jack, but we also got to rip back the layers of their relationships with each other and dynamic as a family which i LOVE. even if you don't think this is a great horror story, don't deny it is a baller family drama. 3. the horror of it all. whether you want to look at it as a family being attacked by ghosts, or a father being overcome by an extreme case of cabin fever, or even if the whole murdering thing doesn't scare you but you can see the fear that comes with having a family member who battles with some kind of addiction, this book is fucking scary. it may not have made me physically jump or scream, but i can tell you that it's a story that is gonna stick in my brain and not let go for a long long time (just like any good horror should) now for the obligatory comparison to the movie: it's common knowledge that king himself hates the Kubrick movie, but i love it. so much. it's one of the first horror movies i ever saw and i've seen it many times since, so while it's a popular opinion to love the book and shit on the movie i just can't bring myself to do it. yes, they're very different in a lot of ways, but honestly i think that Kubrick did the best with what he had to work with. a BIG part of the novel is rooted in internal conflict. we spend so much time inside of jack, danny, and wendy's heads that it would have been impossible (imo) to translate that to the screen without a near constant voiceover (like basically just the audiobook playing over all the scenes) sO, i can't fault the movie for what it lacks in depth of character and explanation...i just can't. however, if for some reason you're reading this and you have seen the movie but haven't read the book YOU BETTER READ THE FCKING BOOK ARE YOU JOKING?? READ IT. anyway, dear mr. stephen king, i'm sorry i ever said that your popular books were overhyped. some of them are *cough* IT *cough* but this one isn't. luv, kat okay that's all read this book i don't have an outro okay byeeeee"
The Shining,"This scene from Friends pretty much sums up my feelings about this book: ""Rachel: Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer? Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. How often do you read it? Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again? Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining? The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours."""
The Shining,"This was most excellent; I can 100% see why this is many readers favorite Stephen King novel. Heck, it's my favorite novel of his to date, although I have a good number of his books to catch up on. I've found myself overly critical of his work in the past, possibly due to the fact that he's so well known, but I feel it's more been a fault on my end. Previously I've picked up one of his doorstops at a time I wasn't prepared to fully invest in the time and energy it takes to immerse oneself into his world building and lengthy details. This time, I was ready. (Also, this was only like 600 pages which felt like a novella compared to IT.) I'm finally able to understand why so many people hold the standard of traditional horror in comparison to this novel. Sure, it has all the creepy crawlies and spooky wookies to get your heart racing, but it's so grounded in reality that I had a hard time rationalizing with myself that ""it's just a story."" The 150 page set up is well worth the reader's time, as it lays the groundwork for much of the behind the narrative, and it also gave me a chance to bond with precious Danny before the shit hit the fan. I may be the last person on the planet to have read this book, but just in case I'm not, I wanted to share some of the things that really hit home with me. Just like is, at heart, a disturbing coming-of-age story, was an impeccable tale of extreme cabin fever with a hefty dose of ""the destructive nature of alcoholism"". When you break it down like that, the supernatural elements actually seem to take a backseat to the very real horror of what it's like living with someone struggling through addiction. I've heard all the stories of how this book helped SK realize his own struggle with alcohol, and I'm inclined to believe it's true as the writing here was heavy laden with emotion and depth. I apologize for ever calling Mr. King over-hyped. I'm grateful my previous experiences with his wordier novels didn't deter me from finally choosing to read this, as it's a gem of a book and a classic in it's genre. ;) Highly recommended to any other below-the-rock dwellers who may not have happened across this one. Now- to watch the movie or not?"
The Shining,"I'm genuinely asking here because I'm a horror aficionado, so I don't know what all constitutes that genre. To a layman like myself, was horror because it scared the piss out of me and I couldn't sleep without the lights on for a while. is more like a . Yeah, yeah, there at the end things got a little hairy, but it was still a human trotting around getting all stabby. Now, I say because good old Jack getting some help from a couple of freaky paranormal spectres and... In an effort to be transparent, I feel like I should mention that I've never actually watched the movie that was based on this bestselling novel. My husband (who has stopped being surprised by me) gasped out loud when I told him that a few days ago. So, I'm guessing from his reaction that I'm probably in the minority. Now, normally, whether or not you've seen the movie doesn't matter at all, but this is a pretty iconic movie we're talking about, so even having seen it, I kind of knew the plot a bit and (of course) knew who acted the starring roles. I know, I know. None of that matters at all when you're talking about a book. But I just thought it might be relevant because the movie is so incredibly well known that even peasants like myself who haven't seen it, immediately recognize certain images from the film. Jack Nicholson is not the Jack Torrence I was seeing in my head, as described by Stephen King. King's Jack was a handsome young guy who was married to a beautiful woman. Now, Shelly Duval is a fine actor and so is Nicholson. But... Anyway. I was just surprised to find out that the characters in the book were hotties. Alright. The gist is that there's this guy (Jack) who made a few because he was a bit boozy, and is now trying to go straight and get it together for his family. He's a bit of a pompous ass, truth be told. One of those people who feel as though everyone around them just doesn't their tortured genius, you know? But he's not that guy. Which is where King's brilliance as a writer comes in. He doesn't make Jack the , he makes Jack . He's . He's trying so hard to stay on the wagon, he's trying so hard to be a better husband, and he's trying so hard to be the father Danny deserves. And if he hadn't landed a job at a fucking Haunted Hotel, I truly believe he would have made it work. Regardless, Jack is only one of the important characters in this Hallmark Family Movie Channel story. You also have Jack's sweet and beautiful (if a bit too mousy and faithful to the old fucker) wife, Wendy. And, of course, their little son, Danny. Danny has . <--which, when I found this out, FINALLY explained the name of this fucking book to me! Do you know how many this has been subconsciously niggling at my brain? Well, neither do I. But when fellow psychic, mind reader, and hotel employee, Dick Hallorann, tells Danny what rooms to avoid over the winter because he can feel Danny's super-bright ? It was like a puzzle I didn't even know I was trying to solve clicked into place! It was one of those moments you have where you suddenly realize that there's you don't know. For one brief second, I felt like the universe had given me a high-five I hadn't asked for and then didn't even pull away at the last second. So, what happens when you toss a recovering alcoholic with a penchant towards abusive behavior, an overly-optimistic woman who tends to flutter instead of walk, and a 5 year old who can tell what they are both thinking, inside of a hotel that basically wants to eat them? Well, I don't want to spoil anything for the 3 people who don't know how all this turns out, but... Anyway. Good stuff. I'm glad my pals forced me (once again) outside my comfort zone. Buddy Read with 4/16"
The Shining,
The Shining,"About as perfect a haunted house story as can be, King was at his best here. It's as though he built a haunted house and then filled every nook and cranny with detail. King is also at his best in regard to characterization, all well rounded and complete, we know family relationships, group dynamics, all the old hidden buried fears. King touches base with psychological elements, theological, metaphysical, spiritual, and cryptic aspects of a ghost story to wrap the reader in a blanket of horror. ** I watched the 1980 Stanley Kubrik film recently and this made me want to reread the book (which I need to anyway). Kubrik's film grasps the psychological elements of the book and delivers an extra large thin crust The Works pizza of haunted house horror. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is still the defining image of this tortured man. While some critics have derided the slow pace of the film (atypical for jump-out-and-yell-BOO! horror fliks of the time) I felt that Kubrik was building the tone and mood of the story to the grisly final moments. King himself has attributed mixed emotions to the film as an adaptation, but has consistently agreed that the imagery of an internal struggle with the dark side of Jack's psyche is a contribution to the horror film genre. King also disagreed with the casting of Nicholson who too closely identified with insanity (due largely to his exceptional work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Interestingly, King himself was battling alcoholism while writing the classic and viewing his work and Kubrik's vision from this perspective adds greater depth to an understanding and appreciation of both."
The Shining,"Quite simply put, The Shining is the best horror story I have ever read. It scared the hell out of me. Over a period of time, I have noticed certain standard ""motifs"" in horror stories. One of these I call ""The Lost Child"". Such stories will typically involve a child, who can see what the silly grownups cannot see (or, even if they do see, don't acknowledge because it goes against reason and logic): and who fights, however high the odds stacked against him/ her are. Danny Torrance is such a boy. Danny can read minds. He can see the frightening thoughts inside his Dad's and Mom's heads (""DIVORCE"", ""SUICIDE"") but is powerless to do anything about it. Danny does not know that he has a gift; he takes it as a matter of course, until Dick Halloran of the Overlook Hotel tells him that he ""shines on"". Jack Torrance, Danny's Dad, reformed alcoholic and struggling writer, is trying to put his life back together after a tragedy. He gets what he sees as the ideal chance when he lands the job of caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. In the snowed-in hotel with only his son and wife Wendy, Jack assumes that he will get enough quality time to be with his family, patch up old quarrels, and write that breakout novel. But the Overlook has other plans. The hotel, which feeds on and grows in strength from the evils committed on its premises, wants Danny-permanently-to join its crew of ghostly inhabitants. And to do that, it needs to get to Jack... The novel slowly grows in horror, starting with mild unease, moving up through sweaty palms and dry mouth, to pure, gut-wrenching terror. Jack's slow slide into madness is paralleled by the growth in power of the hotel's dark miasma, and Danny's extraordinary capabilities. We are on a roller-coaster ride into darkness. The world of grownups is often frighteningly incomprehensible to young children: these fears seldom die as we grow up, but remain dormant in our psyche. There are very few of us who does not have a ghost in our childhood somewhere. It is when the writer invokes this ghost that story gets to us. King does a masterly job of awakening that child, and putting him/ her in the midst of childhood terrors through the alter ego of Danny Torrance, lost in the cavernous corridors of the Overlook. There are a lot of passages which literally creeped me out in this novel (the topiary animals, the fire hose in the corridor, the woman in the bathroom to name a few). As King has said elsewhere, the monster behind the door is more frightening than the monster slavering at you: this book is full of such monsters. More importantly, you will keep on remembering your own boogeymen while you are reading; and long after you finish, you will feel the urge to look behind you. Horror stories are a form of catharsis. As King says, the writer takes you to the body covered under the sheet: you feel it, and are frightened. A true masterpiece."
The Shining,"Years ago, I stayed at a brand new Vegas hotel for a conference. Brand. New. This shining black tower of decadence had been decorated only a few months before I got there. It had all the ambiance of a freshly vacuumed rental car. In time it would wear Vegas, or vice versa, but for now: it was the new, gormless kid on the block. So imagine my surprise when, on the last day of my stay, I was tormented all night long by something that turned on the jets in my hot tub, stomped heavily to and fro every time I turned the lights out, and, eventually, after I told the room audibly to ""cut it out, I've got an early flight,"" slammed a shaking blow into the headboard directly beside me to remind me who had seniority in this place. In the morning, I confessed to the front desk I'd had a bit of an exciting night, and not in the usual Vegas way. With a glance at the room number, the clerk said he bet that I had. Later, I found out the brand new hotel had only been a few weeks old when a man had jumped to his death from one of the rooms; the stylish glass balconies I'd enjoyed were an aftermarket part, designed to keep other tortured guests from following suit. Unclear if my room had been the unlucky suite. Unclear if my room was like that because the man had jumped, or if the man had jumped because my room was like that. So: that's The Shining. I'm sure I'm the last person in the world to have read the book (I haven't seen the film still, but now I will), but better late than never, right? Sucks to shine in a hotel hungry for it, I guess."
The Shining,"“Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” When I first read The Shining a number of years ago I thought it was fantastic and gave it 5 stars, but it just never ranked as a personal favourite. On this reread, however, my socks were well and truly blown off and I had an entirely different experience. This is why I will always be a huge advocate for rereading - it’s quite apparent that wherever your head is at, or whatever life circumstances you find yourself in, can really impact how you view a book. As if that isn’t obvious. On my first read, I was impatient. I was just starting to read King, I wanted the SCARY BITS. This time around I was emotionally involved. I felt a deep connection to Danny and I could really tap into Wendy’s fears as a parent. A younger, more naive me would have thought “why don’t you just fucking leave if all this creepy shit is happening?” - well, until the snow storm at least - but now I can appreciate this as a last chance saloon for the Torrances. They needed the money, they really had nothing else to go back to. The Shining is surely one of King’s scariest, if not THE scariest - a few scenes in Pet Sematary might rival this title. One scene in particular left me feeling claustrophobic and breathless, and I regretted reading it one night before bed when I was home alone. I love that there’s so much history to the Overlook and that the former guests continue to hang around... Jack’s descent into madness is terrifying. He is a complex character and it is difficult to know whether we are to sympathise with him or not. He’s far from a perfect father, but we are all flawed in our ways - just maybe not to this extreme. I shed a little tear towards the end, because I think in spite of all he has done, he does love his son - he was just the perfect prey for the Overlook to get its claws into. I thoroughly LOVED this reread, and also the extra prologue and epilogue this edition has. The prologue in particular is something you should seek out if you’re a fan of The Shining - it really added another layer of history. 5 stars. Reread November 2023 on big King chronological reread. Still 5 stars."
The Shining,"Reread for my Horror Group Challenge & another Group Ghost Walk Challenge * 4.5 Stars I'm not sure why I only saw the movie and never read the book. I loved the movie so much it makes no sense, but back in the day, not many things make sense to me. I will have to go back and watch the movie again to see all of the different little changes. Now I know why some things happened. You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part. Wow! I know the book messed with my head but I didn't realize it would make me write that way! I hope anyone reading this can understand what I meant. I really did enjoy the book, although I did feel a bit crazier than I am at times with all of the voices in everyone's head! :) I didn't want one of the bad things that happened in the movie to NOT happen in the book. I didn't want to read that part and lo and behold, it didn't happen! Yay! The ending in the book was a lot better than the movie. Once again, I really did enjoy this book and look forward to reading and re-reading more of the golden oldies! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 BLOG:"

The Shining,"This book was like a slow claustrophobic squeeze around my neck; I can definitely see why this book from KING is his most classic one yet. I really enjoyed the way he tackled difficult subjects— abuse, alcoholism, a difficult marriage, and mixes them with horror elements; it was definitely a deep dive read. You can watch the liveshow for my overall thoughts but here are my short general thoughts on the book overall: was lovely. Too cute sometimes. This smol bb boy literally stomped his tiny foot and said to the mean nasty ol' Overlook: . He didn't say that last part. Heavily implied though. . What a character. One moment you hate him. Like bitch. He needs therapy. Well, the whole family, honestly. The next, maybe you'll sympathize with him. Or not. Either way, King has a way of writing such characters with really complex layers that really gives them a definite look over. . My girl suffered through with this shit. Homegirl barely got it through with all the misogyny, constantly sexualized, that rough toxic masculinity shit, all the ghosts and demons thrown at her. Me shouting out through the entire book: This man carried this whole fucking book on his back if you asked me. The only person of color in this book that really changed and saved the whole story for all of us. Imagine if there were more POC here. The Overlook wouldn't even stand a chance. The blatant and completely unnecessary uses of the n word and other racist dialogue. King is white. Took too much of a liberation with this and really made me uncomfortable and took me out of the story a few times. I understand it takes place in the 70s. The sexual depictions of pretty much every female character in this book. The male gaze was strong with this one. Eurgh. . Me: ahahAhaHaHah— what? Edward Scissorhands could let me tell you. Overall a good solid read. Not too scary though. Watch the The Late Night Book Club Liveshow here: | | |"
The Shining,"""He sat down on one of the stools and propped his elbows on the bar’s leather-cushioned edge. At his left hand was a bowl for peanuts – now empty, of course. The first bar he’d been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry – just his luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him, and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his belly to his throat to his mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold."" - Stephen King, A lot of terrifying things occur in . None of them are as terrifying as the excruciating battle fought between the ears of an alcoholic. Stephen King’s novel is a classic ghost story; it is also a painful portrait of a man’s mental breakdown. That man is Jack Torrance, a gifted writer who has squandered his talent with booze and a bad temper. He and his family – wife Wendy, young son Danny – are wintering at the Overlook, a hotel in the Colorado mountains with a long and checkered past. Jack has been given a job as the caretaker of the Overlook. It’s his last chance to make good after losing a teaching position at a prestigious prep school. All he has to do is keep the rooms heated, provide basic upkeep, and make minor repairs. He thinks the job will give him plenty of time to finish the play he has been laboring on. The only trick is the isolation. Once the snows move in, they will make the winding mountain roads impassable. The Overlook will be cut off. It’s the perfect spot to do some writing, go homicidally crazy, or both. The genius of is the simplicity of its setting. Isolated location. Spirit infested living accommodations. Precocious child. All these story elements are exceedingly familiar. Layered onto this foundation is King’s exploration of Jack’s increasingly fragile psyche. King is at the height of his powers in his evocation of Jack. He makes visceral the taste of crushed aspirin, the piercing headaches, the desperate thirst for a drink. Jack is a complex character, at once a loving husband, a doting father, a grade-A prick, and a self-destructive wreck. King is known for outsized epics with dozens of characters. Here, he pares things down to four main players. Besides Jack there are Wendy, Danny, and Dick Hallorann, the Overlook’s chef. King cleverly utilizes a third-person limited viewpoint, which allows him a tell the story through several eyes, giving him the ability to both widen and narrow the focus at his whim. After Jack, Danny is the most important figure. He has “the shine”, a kind of ESP that includes mental telepathy, sensitivity to the paranormal, mind reading, and the gift of prophecy. (The ability to predict the future is not his best talent, though. If it was, the story would have turned out differently). Danny’s abilities allow him to perceive the danger of the Overlook Hotel – and its poisonous effect on his father – long before anyone else. I think King’s major achievement is the way he grounds the weirdness in reality. He is methodical in building this limited world (the Overlook, the town of Sidewinder) and sketching its handful of characters. His plotting takes a bit of time, but there is a reason. Take, for instance, an early scene in which Jack and Wendy take Danny to a psychiatrist. The upshot is that the psychiatrist gives a mushy-mumbly diagnosis of Danny’s “special” abilities that momentarily soothes his parents. It’s a scene that could easily have been excised, since it’s clear the doctor is wrong, and it’s obvious that Danny’s abilities are beyond rational explanation. The value of keeping it, though, is that it more firmly roots the proceedings in the actual world. Eventually, King cuts loose and unleashes all manner of insanity. Some of it, frankly, is a bit goofy. However, all the work he has done setting up his endgame paid off. I believed so much that I didn't bat an eye once the hotel came – for lack of a better phrase – to life. is a slow simmering tale that eventually explodes in the unrestrained violence and gore that has made King wealthy beyond imagining. (Of course, compared to some of his other titles, is practically subtle). The ending is something that is foreshadowed early on; unlike the producers of , I will not spoil it for those who’ve managed to avoid learning it. I’m not sure I’m a huge fan of how King concludes things, but I liked the lead-up so much that I can let that pass. I appreciated the slow turning of the screws, the gradual accretion of detail, the building of tension before it all boils over. I suppose a brief mention of Kubrick’s famous movie version is in order. I’ve heard that King hated it, and I can totally see why. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance as already half-crazy by the time the title card is shown. It’s hard to take his portrayal seriously when his eyes are screaming from the very first scene. The film version of Jack Torrance is an exercise in Jack Nicholson seeing if he can out-Jack Nicholson himself. (He does). I like Kubrick’s , for its formal brilliance if nothing more. The novel, as is often the case, is far superior. The book version of Jack Torrance is far different from his cinematic shadow. He begins as a deeply flawed man with an ugly past, a serious addiction, and a nasty streak a mile wide. But he is also a man who loves – or believes he loves – his wife and child. You see flashes of a good man, a man you don’t want to see destroyed. The erosion of Jack’s mind and soul is ’s narrative backbone. King paints an indelible portrait. Jack chewing Excedrin after Excedrin. Jack wiping his lips till they bleed. Jack trying to distract himself from the thought of a drink. Jack trying to reconcile the man he wanted to be with the man he has demonstrated to the world. This is a fully realized and unforgettable character. It’s an accomplishment, and a testament to King’s skill. A skill, perhaps, that is sometimes overlooked. I am slowly making my way through Stephen King’s extensive canon. So far, my favorite has been , where King uses a ghoulish conceit (an Indian burial ground that can bring the dead back to life) to explore a very real human concern (loss and grief). He touched such powerful chords with that book that I hesitate to ever open it again. It’s becoming very clear to me that King is a genius. An artist of the first order. Not just a top-notch storyteller. Not just a guy with an incredible imagination. But a bona fide literary master. He writes things that you read and don’t forget, ever. A lot of wacky and macabre things happen at the Overlook during the course of . The tension, the shocks, the slow revelation of the lurking terror, are all things that will keep you turning pages with increasing rapidity. It is also the reason that (along with King’s other works) is so obviously translatable to film. But the reason this is unforgettable is the framework that King builds upon. The horror of the supernatural is not nearly so deep and so dread as that which passes between flawed human beings."
The Shining,"When MC Johnny is in the haunted mountain hotel house, twins can raise their axes and sway to the beat of the barkeepers´ whispering background vibe Maybe just so popular because of the movie I´ve read a ton of Kings´ novels, some already 2 times, and must say that this is a good, but by far not one of his best works. It has some freaking labyrinth, bathroom, parenting, and insanity axe murder moments, but besides that, there is much less terror, paranormal activity, and horror than one would expect and hope for. One could call it subtle and slowly accelerating in suspense and action, but subjectively it´s just not unleashing its full potential. Its close to only focus is on going insane in an isolated place and thereby facing ones´ demons, talking with ghosts, and self-doubt. I honestly even was a bit disappointed, because I know the better, harder, and far cooler King who switches perspectives, has big picture scenes, and much more badass characters than just stumbling fathers with alcohol problems. Many autobiographical undertones in the horror hotel There is so much personal King in this, his fear of wasps, not liking a kid, being a writer and substance abuser, probably even some relationship problems, especially in combination with the mentioned bad parenting and being high as heck tendencies. Not sure about that, he mentioned other inspirations in interviews, prefaces, and lectures, but because of his tendency to kind of use writing as a self reflection and therapy session, one can assume that there might have been the one or other epic Tabitha vs Stephen battle or King vs his kids, especially his son, that laid the groundwork. Psi powers penetrate mental sanity Going insane in the membrane on a wacky holiday trip has never been so much fun, especially because the issues and frustrations of the main protagonist are the foundation for escalation towards total bonkers status. A stable, happy person might have found a better way to deal with career and relationship problems, but that would have been a pretty boring attempt and not half as cool as good old letting the anger out before it hurts the hater, instead leaving everyone else as a victim or dead. That´s much better for the salvation of the ones that also caused the whole mess. Alternative family therapy, anger management, bonding, and teambuilding methods No matter what the friendlier, calmer approaches might tell, some in you face methods of innovative, new therapeutic schools recommend just unleashing ones´ anger, maybe accompanied by visualizing ones´ demons until they manifest as if they are real and give more, even greater tips and tricks to handle the situation. How much could be real? With all that quantum, parallel universe, time travel, extra dimension stuff, one really doesn´t know what will come out in centuries or millennia when 4567 scientists will use their instruments to find correlations between physics, death, haunted place, and possibly even souls, demons, and damned sex succubi. Maybe we just haven´t figured out how to construct the right equipment to see that we are surrounded by myriads of emanating reminiscences of billions of years of evolution and trillions of immortal, multi dimensional consciences that are created with each physical body. Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique"
The Shining,"This is basically just another haunted house story...but my, such a great one, Stephen King brings all his considerable talents into view. Though his tendency to overwrite shows too, a little editing would have made it even better by cutting out superfluous pages, nothing wrong in being succinct . If you like ghouls, strange apparitions , an atmosphere thick with foreboding this ride will satisfy, not to mention the continuous party in the Colorado Lounge, where drinks are on the house, with Lloyd the perpetually agreeable gentleman presiding ... A vague bartender who knows how to mix them, wild, crazy , raucous ""people"" inside, and noisy scenes happening frequently, sounds like fun...Now to begin, John ""Jack"" Torrance has a little drinking problem, a falling down drunk, to be honest, it wouldn't matter much to anyone, except he is married with a lovely wife Wendy and a good son Danny age five, he the kid, sees things though...which becomes a problem later on. The parents are in their late twenties, Jack has recently lost his job teaching at a prep school , an English instructor in New England, very appropriate. What is not, beating up a spoiled rich student damaging his old car, Jack has a bad temper obviously , and gives no mercy. Let go by the school he desperately needs another job quickly, this is where the ancient Overlook Hotel, in the high Rocky Mountains of Colorado, over 10,000 feet in elevation, becomes important. Jack's best friend Albert Shockley a wealthy man, obtains him the caretaker position there in the winter, he is part owner and fellow lush. A new start for the aspiring writer; five months in isolation with only his rattled family , the roads become impassable because of heavy snows, often blizzards strike the area, Mr. Torrance has the time now to finish his play, that will solve all the difficulties. Nevertheless the Overlook has other ideas not so nice, room 217 for instance, nor is it the only one , the sinister hotel elevator disturbs the occupants, a free spirit , which makes a quite chilling situation there. The three humans in the creepy building, months alone, can cause some to become unbalanced, even maniacal, as the temperature drops and the snowflakes fall, tense Wendy feels uneasy... Terrific novel and the little child, Daniel (Danny) his invisible, unearthly friend, the aloof Tony , dominates the preceding, they are rather a peculiar pair... good or bad is the question, the answer... read the book. However in reality and shall I write these words...the fiendish Overlook Hotel is the star."
The Shining,"Another Stephen King re-read complete! I have had this book marked at 4 stars since I added it a few years ago. It has probably been 20 years since I last read the book and, in that time, I have watched the Kubrick movie a few times. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of the Kubrick movie (and I hear King wasn’t either). I think my thoughts on the movie combined with being a couple of decades removed from reading it skewed my rating a bit low. This time, though, with the refresher – 5 stars all the way! Definitely classic King, and maybe one of the most perfect monster/ghost stories ever written. One very important thing I think that people forget (including me) is I listened to the book this time and the audio narration was great. I was enthralled the entire time and the narrator did a great job raising the stakes as the story progressed. If you are also considering a re-read, the audiobook is a great option. If you are a King fan and haven’t read this, you should! If you are looking for a place to start King, this is not a bad choice. It is a little more psychologically complex that a couple of the other titles I recommend as King starting points ( and ), but definitely would give anyone a good feel for King. While there are some elements in the book similar to the movie, forget everything you have seen and the impressions Kubrick has given you and try the book. I think you will find it to be a vastly improved experience. Also, I hear the more recent mini-series is much more true to the book – I hope to hunt that one down, soon!"
The Shining,"Ok, Mr. Jack Torrence,..... ..... The man who was going to live by his wits....be a best selling author, acclaimed playwright and winner of the New York critics award, man of letters, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, .....you killed my appetite ..... I’ll never be able to look at a Triscuit cracker again without thinking of “The Shining”, .... let alone eat one. You, Sir, took the joy out of crunching those little squares. Haha! Great characters- storytelling- thriller by a master. Yep... I can see why readers get hooked on King. Huge thanks to Zoey!!!!!! I’m so glad I read this!!! An adrenaline rush!!!!! Off for a long Sat. morning hike - starting in 31 degrees. Geee... this is California!"
The Shining,"“You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I’m sixty years old this January.” “Huh?” “You got a knack,” Hallorann said, turning to him. “Me, I’ve always called it shining. That’s what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without even openin our mouths.” The Shining is a story about the Torrance family. Jack, his wife Wendy and their five year old son, Danny. Jack is hired as the caretaker at the remote Overlook Hotel for the winter season. He is informed by the hotel manager that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, killed his entire family inside the hotel. Specifically, that Grady “murdered his two little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and then committed suicide.” As Jack later learns, the Overlook has a long and terrible history. Over the years, it has housed illicit affairs, horrible murders, and mob style executions. Nonetheless, Jack is determined to be the caretaker. In the past, Jack, an aspiring writer and former school teacher has struggled with alcohol and anger issues. Once, he accidentally broke his son’s arm while trying to discipline him. More recently, Jack assaulted a student when he caught him letting the air out of his tires. The incident cost Jack his teaching job and almost his marriage. Jack, now a recovering alcoholic and working on a play, hopes that the seclusion of the Overlook will help him finish the play and reconnect with his wife and son. But the Overlook Hotel has other ideas. The longer the Torrance family stays, the more haunting and powerful it becomes….. So, obviously this is Stephen King at his very best. Every chapter leaves you wanting more, and every sentence in this book is outstanding. Brilliantly written horror that is both magical and terrifying with fully developed characters that are equal parts innocent, vulnerable and pure evil! The Overlook hotel, is a living nightmare, its bricks and mortar soaked through with past horrors. The creepy hedge animals, the old fashioned fire extinguisher: a coiled snake ready to strike, the sounds of a party echoing through the empty rooms and halls, the boiler, unstable and dangerous. The imagery playing through my mind was magnificent! The Shining is an absolute masterpiece. A must read classic. Highly recommend 🙌🏻"
The Shining,"All the stars! Loved, loved this book! I'm not sure what to say in this review that hasn't been said by others. I was blown away by how great this book was. It was so much better then the movie! The slow progression of insanity with Jack Torrance was one of the best things about this book. I loved the overall menacing presence of The Overlook. I loved how the hotel becomes more violent and threatening to Danny and his family the longer they stay there. It was so gripping and overwhelming as the story unfolded. You just couldn't quit reading! I enjoyed Danny's struggle as a kid with understanding his 'gifts' and how to use them in a positive way. Danny, don't you dare go into room 217! This whole book was just awesome! This review doesn't give this book justice for how great it is. I recommend this book to Stephen King fans and horror lovers."
The Shining,"It’s interesting how at different times in life very different things stand out about this story. What’s scary changes with time, I suppose. “This inhuman place makes human monsters.” When I was a kid way too young for reading King, the hotel was the scariest thing ever. On later rereads I was feeling the pain of Jack’s struggle with addiction, trying to overcome it but instead spiraling towards destruction and the relentless hounding of the Overlook. And now it’s Jack himself who freaks the living hell out of me — . The hotel and its ghosts did not have to work too hard to reduce Jack to his entitled base impulses, did they? Jack Torrance goes through life angrily counting the wrongs done to him, minimizing - willingly or subconsciously - his own contribution to his misery, with Overlook just adding to the blind rage that eventually takes him over, a logical conclusion to that hair-trigger temper and abusive tendencies of his. . And yet, even with me terrified of Jack ever since the first few pages of that simmering and initally pretty hidden rage I still cannot help but feel for him, for his doomed efforts to be better, for his love of his son, for his absolutely shitty luck of ending up in the worst place possible for him. King’s Jack Torrance is a wonderfully complex guy, far from the immediate crazy-eyed-insane of Jack Nicholson in Kubrick’s adaptation (and sadly, the image of Jack that most people have). ————— This book was when I first realized back at twelve with a few King books under my belt already that Uncle Stevie is way more disturbing when he hints at things rather than being overtly graphic. . Jack’s rocque mallet is almost a relief after that chapter where he’s almost unsure whether the topiary is moving, and Danny finding out what’s in room 217 is less scary than that sense outside of the room that the fire hydrant hose is about to grab him. It’s the slow dreadful anticipation rather than jump scares that always did it for me. And this book yet again proves to me that even reread with older eyes its one more stone in King’s pedestal among great modern writers. Seriously, chuck some Hemingway out of literature courses and add instead, dear professors. —————— Also posted on ."
The Shining,"His best book is 'The Green Mile,' but since it doesn't quite fall under the Horror category, it is either 'Shining' or 'Carrie' which take top prize. There is not one single detriment to this well-known tale of the disintegration of the American family within the realm of the undead. King here is as he has never been since: metaphoric and concise. He usually adds fact upon useless fact that converts a 400 page work into something more gargantuan, and, therefore, less enthralling. King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why. His story is about the build up of tension, the ""shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans. The boiler burns, blows everything up just as Jack Torrence forgets his humanity & becomes an ego/id complex. His selfishness & his alcoholism (a hereditary illness... another theme about family ""curses,"" and weak threads) leads to savagery. The ghosts are the manifestations of a child's bruised home-life and the suffocation and claustrophobia have more to do with that tragic past than the hotel's eerie interior. I place this masterpiece next to 'The Exorcist', a tale that is more than just a simple tale of demonic possession. To say the 'The Shining' is just a ghost story is something Kubrick ran with... completely ignoring the pathos of a family eating away at itself. The Torrences suffer because they had been broken prior to the stay at the Overlook... it seems that for this one all the stars aligned and all the ingredients for one of the most amazing horror stories of all time mixed exquisitely. This one is the one that made King king."
The Shining,"Thank you the King of author who has written something so memorable that I cannot help myself to reread and see his extraordinary creative mind who finds millions of ways to scare me sh*tless! Redrum Fire extinguishers Roque Mallet Mind freaking maze All work no play makes Jake dull boy! Creepy Grady twins Tricycle Scary woman in bath Room 237 Japanese lantern Here comes Johnny ( okay this part belongs to the movie to tribute Johnny Carson) Jack Torrance is totally satan, Overlook Hotel is last gate to the hell and little Danny speaks with the angels by communicating them using his finger ( that might be most biblical approach to the book but it makes more sense than conspiracy theories I’ve written) Overall: I think the authors has brilliant minds shine like brightest stars in the sky! Mr. King already earned to have his own planet!"
The Shining,"Constant Readers may well be surprised, but even after a second reading, this remains one of my least liked early Stephen King reads! This perception is also probably influenced by the far better and classic Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson movie, which I feel is more grounded and a lot less supernatural based than the book. A personal admission I should add for context, is that I find most ghost stories unfathomable because of their reality 'rules' often being bent ad-hoc to meet the needs of the story being told... just like in this book. 5.5 out of 12!"
The Shining,"Update 10/30/21: Wow… I’ve read this book four times now?! I don’t know what I wrote before, but it’s still a four-star read for me. It was interesting reading it in this weird post-Covidish time since it is heavy on themes of isolation and being quarantined off from the rest of the world. Happy Halloween everyone. Time to go take my medicine. ———————- Update 8/28/18: I completely agree with everything I said two years ago. Third time reading this one, and I think I enjoyed it the most this time around. Now it’s time to watch the movie and read Doctor Sleep. Kicking off a couple months of reading scary, autumny, Halloweeny books. ———————- Old school Stephen King, man. That's where it's at. This is a high point in the King canon for me. In Salem's Lot before this, he developed fascinating characters inhabited a beautifully described small town. He took his time slowly unraveling the story, taking pages and pages to build the setting and deepen our relationship with the large cast of characters. In The Shining, there are basically three characters outside of a small cast of supporting actors. The setting is really just a giant old hotel in a snowy Colorado town. But SK takes even more pages, sometimes entire blasted chapters to develop his characters and set his scenes. Like I said before, it's a slow burn, man. The fact that King takes his time building the horror makes the scary scenes that much scarier. It's not a horror novel full of jump scares and monsters. It's effective by drawing us deep into the minds of the characters, overhearing their innermost thoughts, and freaking out right along with them. The scenes there for horror effect and the iconic stuff from the movie aren't even all that necessary. There is so much else going on in the isolation, addition, desperation, schizophrenia of it all that plays so much harder on your emotions than what's hiding behind a hotel room door. It's long winded at times, sure, but it's mostly necessary. We get to know the Torrence family better than we wish we ever did by the end of this thing. From the awkwardness of the initial conversation with Jack and Ullman to the wild and crazy climax, the pages keep turning and your heart keeps pounding faster. King takes you on a long roller coaster ride that moves slowly up the long, high incline before bringing us crashing down screaming our faces off at the end. And then we grab another King book and hope the ride is just as thrilling as the one before. I'm looking at you, Doctor Sleep."
The Shining,"Even though the film version of this one from Stanley Kubrick is generally considered a horror classic, Stephen King has never been shy about making his dislike of it known. He hates it so much that he was heavily involved in making a more faithful adaptation of it as TV mini-series in 1997. (This inferior version invited comparisons of Stephen Weber from to one of Jack Nicholson’s most iconic performances. So that worked well….) Considering Uncle Stevie’s longstanding grudge about it, I was more than a little shocked when he recently made a of to accept the changes that the new TV show was making. I can’t quite wrap my head around why a genius director creating something new and brilliant based on his story is bad, but anything that a fairly shitty TV show does with the source material is A-OK with King? Whatever…. On to the book. As most everyone knows, this is about a family spending the winter in a haunted hotel in the Rocky Mountains called the Overlook. Jack Torrance was a teacher and promising writer, but his alcoholism and short temper wrecked his career and very nearly ended his marriage. Jack has been sober over a year, and he and Wendy have started down the path of reconciliation. However, she can never entirely forgive him for breaking the arm of their son Danny in an incident that was equal parts rage and accident. Five year old Danny has psychic mojo that includes reading thoughts and precognition courtesy of visions shown to him by his imaginary friend, Tony. Nearly broke, Jack takes on the job of being the winter caretaker for the Overlook. This means that the family will spend months alone in the hotel once the snow flies, and the last caretaker went axe-happy and killed his family. Unfortunately, the Overlook is like an emotional sponge that has soaked in every ugly act that ever took place within its rooms, and the presence of a high-powered psychic like Danny kicks the place into overdrive. As Jack is being driven into madness, Wendy and Danny become increasingly terrified of what he might do. I once read something in which King talked about denial of his own substance abuse problems in which he noted that he somehow wrote without ever once realizing he was describing his own alcoholism. That element of the Jack Torrence character is what makes this one of his better books. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with a bunch of ghosts is scary in a horror story kind of way. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with an ill-tempered drunk with a history of violence as he is cracking up is downright terrifying. Adding even more weight to that idea is that Jack Torrance isn’t a monster. He’s a troubled man who does love his wife and son, and he’s self-aware enough to realize that he’s on the brink. He’ll either turn his life around and earn his wife’s trust back, or he’ll give in to his own worst impulses. This would be hard enough under any circumstances, but under the influence of the evil spirits of the Overlook, Jack becomes a tragedy. Another element jumped out at me while re-reading this time. King talked in his non-fiction (Which I remember as being entertaining, but probably very dated by now. I would be very interested if Uncle Stevie wanted to take another look at what’s become of the horror genre since he wrote that one.) about the economic factor of and how a part of why the movie worked was that the family was essentially trapped by their finances. He uses that idea to good effect here. Most people would run screaming from the Overloook in less than a week, but we’re frequently reminded that the Torrance family was swirling the drain financially. If the perception is that Jack botched this job, his last chance to get back to a more stable lifestyle is probably shot and that goes a long way towards allowing him to convince himself and Wendy that they’re overreacting to the weird occurrences during the early stages, and by the time they’ve become snowed in, the Overlook has its hooks deep into Jack. It’s those more mundane things like a family struggling with money and that an evil entity turns one of them against the others by playing on his inherent weaknesses that make this one of my favorite King novels."
The Shining,"Once upon a time, there was a young man who believed that books were always better than movies. Everyone whose opinion he respected told him it was so, and he believed it must be. And for a time he saw nothing to shake this belief. He read Dickens and saw filmed versions and knew it was so. He read Dumas and no version of Musketeers could shake his conviction. , , and all bore this out. But the young man discovered that it wasn't just the classics for which this held true. He read the popular books of his day, the mysteries and science fictions and fantasies, and those were always better than the movie. But the inevitable happened. One day his notions were challenged in the most devastating way. A man, wild with isolated madness, chopped a door down, poked his head through the cracks and declared his frightening presence. It was an iconic moment. A new idol to replace the idol he'd worshipped, but he didn't know it yet. The young man went out to read the book that gave birth to that image, knowing that the book MUST be better than the film. He turned the pages with excitement, and it began as he expected it would. Tension built, suspense drove him on, the characters seemed fuller and richer, but that began to slip away. Where was the thematic depth? Where was the powerful iconography? Where was the terror? It was gone, and with it his notions. Suddenly there was a film that was better than the book. By a long distance. And it was happening everywhere around him. On screen Replicants beat their written counterparts. Russian poets in frozen manors moved him in ways the translated words couldn't. Christs made love to Magdalenes and it made him weep for joy. The truth was other. Rare though it remained, movies could be better than their sources. He would never again be the snob he'd been. He would embrace those films that trumped their books, and proclaim it to the world."
The Shining,"Actual rating: 4.25 🌟 Obviously this story is a famous one, which led to me not being all too surprised at the things that happened, but this doesn't mean that reading this book wasn't exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. In fact, the suspense is spread in the right amount of doses throughout the book, which is something I would love to see more often. I read many stories where one thrilling thing happens after another, which just gets repetitive after awhile and takes away from the excitement. King, however, knows how to keep you hooked without ever going over the top. Despite my copy having over 600 pages, I felt entertained throughout and was never bored. This is how suspense is supposed to be written. Obviously, many strange things happen in this story. Many of them might even seem completely unbelievable and ridiculous. But once again, King has a way of writing that makes everything sound like they could actually happen. I don't know how he does it, but every time I read something by him I think to myself:""Yeah sure, of course this is plausible. Of course this can be a thing."" No matter how out of this world the plot may seem. I really liked how every character in this book had a distinctive voice, even though there were many changes of the point of view. This shows what great and realistic characters Stephen King creates every time. Especially the main character Jack struck a chord with me, even though I am nothing like him. But there was just something about him...I don't know how to describe it, but he was written in a way that made all his actions seem somehow comprehensible, no matter how shocking they might have been. Of course everybody reads a book differently and interprets it in their own way. For me, this wasn't just a simple ghost story. For me, it was about a man coming to terms with his own demons more than ever before, and finally facing up to something he has lost control over a long time ago. The only reason this book doesn't get the full five stars from me, is because I didn't get lost in this world as much as I did in the other works by the same author."
The Shining,more like a 3.5 but hey ho
The Shining,"A spine tingling 5 stars and a book worthy in the hall of fame, horrifying yes but also a book that goes beyond horror. A book that leaves sentiment at the door and embraces strong themes of child abuse, alcoholism and the psychological unravelling of a man, a father, a husband, and writer, who is so affected by the very surroundings he sought solace from, he descends into one of the darkest nightmares as the ghostly macabre presence takes hold. A book that evokes such strong emotions it held my attention for the entire novel without deviation. Jack is a recovering alcoholic who takes on a caretaker role at the Outlook hotel in the Colorado Rockies at the end of a season to help him recover from writer’s block and an uncontrolled rage that cost him his teaching job and alcoholism that almost cost him his life and marriage. However, events start to distract Jack when his five-year-old son, who possesses ‘The Shining’ and psychic abilities to read minds, has sightings of the people who once inhabited the hotel. Unable to possess Danny the supernatural forces within the hotel play havoc with Jack’s fragile mental state and with the return to alcohol, he descends into a dark mental abyss where the violence takes hold as Jack takes an axe to the bathroom door in that iconic scene of Jack Nicolson. “Sometimes human places, create inhuman monsters.” The scene is set – Just. Now to the atmospheric backdrop of the book. A worthy accompaniment to this chilling story. The snow bound hills, the hotels expanse, the topiary hedges that come to life, the hotels décor, the basement and even the carpets illicit a specific mention to create a perfect setting for terror to take hold. And then the sounds and the eerie drum beat of a murderous message with the rhythmic repetition of 'red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum….' designed to penetrate your psyche. Two words when combined and reversed (REDRUM) spells MURDER. Just genius. The ghostly incidents never seemed too terrifying on their own but when combined with a character that is unhinged, volatile and recovering from alcoholism then we are faced with one unholy picture of horror. I watched the film years ago and decided to read the book, and it will be no surprise to learn like many others I much preferred the book. To test this notion, I watched the film again and still hold the same opinion, the book did more to create feelings of horror, isolation and fear. So would I recommend? The answer is yes totally!! With such psychologically complex and tragic characters, shocking unsettling events, the perfect tempo in storytelling, the wonderful atmospheric setting with its rhythmic adage of ‘REDRUM’ create a masterpiece in horror that has stood the test of time. Horror is not my go to genre, so I had to ask one of my Goodreads friends Michael (Never ending TBR) for his recommendation in horror for beginners like me!!! Thank you, Michael. Perfect choice, I loved it."
The Shining,"The Shining (The Shining #1) Stephen King Past horrors and evil lurk in Colorado's Overlook Hotel, threatening winter season caretakers Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their young son, Danny. Gifted with the shining, a clairvoyant Danny must battle the darkest evil in the remote hotel in an attempt to save his family from its influence. The Overlook Hotel claimed the most beautiful physical setting of any resort in the world; but Jack Torrance, the new winter caretaker, his wife Wendy and their five-year-old son Danny saw much more than its splendor. Jack saw the Overlook as an opportunity, a desperate way back from failure and despair; Wendy saw this lonely sanctuary as a frail chance to preserve their family; and Danny?... Danny, who was blessed or cursed with a shinning, precognitive gift, saw visions hideously beyond the comprehension of a small boy. He sensed the evil coiled within the Overlook's one hundred and ten empty rooms; an evil that was waiting just for them. عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «درخ‍ش‍ش‌»؛ «درخشان»؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ف‍ن‌ ک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز یازدهم ماه اکتبر سال2000میلادی عنوان: درخ‍ش‍ش‌؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ف‍ن‌ ک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ ب‍رگ‍ردان‌ ب‍ه‍ن‍ام‌ دی‍ان‍ی‌؛ تهران، نشر البرز، سال1378؛ در624ص؛ شابک9644421558؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20م عنوان: درخشش؛ نویسنده استفان کینگ؛ مترجم غلامحسین اعرابی؛ تهران، پلیکان، سال1390؛ در648ص؛ شابک9786005915150؛ عنوان: درخشان‫: علم غیب؛ نویسنده: استیفن کینگ‫؛ مترجم لیلا شاپوریان؛ تهران، نشر قطره، سال1391؛ در711ص؛ شابک9786001196034؛ چاپ دوم تهرن: کتابسرای میردشتی: نشر قطره؛ سال1400؛ در708ص؛ شابک9786227546040؛ نویسنده‌ای جویای نام «جک تورنس» میخواهد زندگی خانوادگی، و شغلی خویش را از نو بسازد؛ «جک» که شغل آموزگاری در مدرسه‌ ی پیش‌ دانشگاهی «ورمونت» را، پس از یورش به یک دانش‌آموز، از دست داده، مشتاقانه سرایداری زمستانی هتل کوهستانی پرت «اوورلوک» را میپذیرد، و امیدوار است تا بتواند، در آن مکان دور افتاده، ارتباطی نو با خانواده‌ ی خویش ـ همسر و پسرش ـ برقرار کند، و به نگارش نمایش‌نامه‌ ی تازه ای نیز بپردازد؛ «دنی» پسر پنج ساله‌ ی «جک» که به برهان موهبتی خدادادی، از توانایی ویژه ای برخوردار است، پس از نقل مكان به هتل «اوورلوک»، درمییابد تصاوير و ارواحی در هتل وجود دارند؛ با بارش برف سنگین، و بسته شدن راه‌های ارتباطی، رویدادهایی رخ میدهند، که افراد خانواده را دچار مشکل میکنند و...؛ سالها پیش از امروز خوانش این کتاب مرا مدهوش کرد نقل از متن: (قسمت اول: مطالب مقدماتی: 1- مصاحبه ی شغلی؛ «جک تورنس» با خود گفت: مردک بدذات!؛ «اولمان» با قد پنج فوت و پنج اینچ ایستاده بود، و وقتی حرکت کرد، حرکتش چنان خشک و شتابان بود، که به نظر میرسید این ویژگیِ همه ی مردان کوچولوی گرد و قلنبه است؛ موهایش مرتب بود، و لباس تیره رنگش، که سنگین ولی راحت بود، باعث میشد مشتری احساس کند، میتواند مشکلات خود را با او در میان بگذارد؛ با لحن تندی با کارگران صحبت میکرد: باید کارتان را درست انجام بدهید؛ روی برگردان یقه اش، گل میخک قرمزی زده بود؛ شاید برای اینکه در خیابان «استوارت» کسی او را با مامور کفن و دفن محلی اشتباه نگیرد وقتی «جک» سخنان «اولمان» را شنید، با خودش فکر کرد که با این اوضاع، لازم نیست علاقه ای به هیچ کدام از افراد آن طرف میز داشته باشد «اولمان» سئوالی مطرح کرد، ولی او منظورش را نفهمید؛ «اولمان» از آن مردانی بود که چنین خطاهایی را برای رسیدگی بعدی در دفتر راهنمای شخصی ذهنشان بایگانی میکنند ببخشید؟ پرسیدم آیا همسر و پسرتان دقیقا میدانند شغل شما در اینجا چیست؟ نگاهی به پرسشنامه ای که مقابلش بود انداخت و گفت: پسرتان دانیل و همسرتان از این کار وحشتی ندارند؟ وندی زن فوق العاده ای است پسرتان هم فوق العاده است؟ جک لبخند زد، لبخندی به پهنای صورتش؛ ما دوست داریم اینطور فکر کنیم؛ در مقایسه با بقیه ی پسربچه های پنجساله، کاملاً متکی به خود است اولمان دیگر لبخند نزد؛ پرسشنامه ی «جک» را در پرونده اش گذاشت، و پرونده را به کشو برگرداند؛ میز تحریر کاملاً خالی بود، و فقط یک کاغذخشک کن، یک تلفن، یک چراغ مطالعه، و یک سبد مخصوص نامه های وارده و صادره، روی آن بود، که نامه ای هم در آن نبود اولمان برخاست و به طرف کمد بایگانیِ گوشه ی اتاق رفت، و گفت: آقای «تورنس»، اگر مایلید نزدیک میز تحریر بیایید، تا نگاهی به کارها بیندازیم؛ پنج ورقه ی بزرگ آورد، و آنها را روی چوب گردوی کاملاً براق میز تحریر گذاشت؛ «جک» بوی ادوکلن «اولمان» را استشمام کرد، و شانه به شانه ی او ایستاد؛ بدون هیچ دلیلی، به فکرش خطور کرد، که تمام مردان یا اصلاً ادوکلن نمیزنند، یا «انگلیش لدر» میزنند، و مجبور شد زبانش را بین دندانهایش فشار بدهد، تا جلوی خنده ی خود را بگیرد؛ از پشت دیوار صداهایی از آشپزخانه میآمد، که مربوط به فعالیتهای ساعت ناهار هتل «اوورلوک» بود اولمان به سرعت شروع به صحبت کرد: بالاترین طبقه، اتاق زیرشیروانی است؛ فعلاً آنجا چیزی نیست به جز یک م��ت خرت و پرت؛ «اوورلوک» بعد از جنگ جهانی دوم، بارها دست به دست شده است، و به نظر میرسد، مدیرانی که پشت سر هم آمده اند، چیزهای زیادی را در اتاق زیرشیروانی گذاشته اند؛ من میخواهم آنجا تله موش بگذارم، و اطراف آن را سمپاشی کنم؛ بعضی از زنهای مستخدم طبقه ی سوم، از آنجا صدای خش خش شنیده اند؛ من باور نمیکنم، ولی حتی یک درصد امکان وجود موش را هم، نباید در هتل نادیده گرفت؛ البته شما که در هیچ وضعیتی اجازه نمیدهید پسرتان به اتاق زیرشیروانی برود جک گفت: نه؛ بعد دوباره نیشش باز شد و با خود فکر کرد: عجب حرف مزخرفی؛ آیا این مردک احمق واقعا فکر میکرد او اجازه میدهد پسرش در اتاق زیرشیروانی که پر از خرت و پرت، تله موش و خدا میداند چه چیزهای دیگری است، پرسه بزند؟ اولمان نقشه ی اتاق زیرشیروانی را به سرعت برداشت، زیر بقیه ی کاغذها گذاشت، و با صدایی دانشمندانه گفت: «اوورلوک» یک صدوده مهمانپذیر دارد، سی تای آن که سوئیت هستند، در طبقه ی سوم قرار دارد؛ ده تا -از جمله سوئیت ریاست جمهوری- در قسمت غربی است، ده تا در وسط، ده تای دیگر در قسمت شرقی؛ ناگفته نماند که همه ی آنها به منظره های باشکوهی مشرف هستند جک با خود فکر کرد بگوید، ممکن است لطفا تبلیغات فروش را کنار بگذارید؟!

The Shining,"QUESTION: Is Stephen King the BEST PURE STORYTELLER of the 20th Century ? ANSWER: Who knows...I haven’t got the slightest wisp of the faintest fragment of a lingering shadow of a clue how to answer that manwich-sized question. However, I do think that in order to have a credible debate on the subject, you would need to include the Prince of the Prolific Page Turner in the argument. That says something to me and it got me thinking that there is a lot to like (and even love) about much of King’s work. Calm down King haters, this is not going to be a slobbering “rah rah” session, but I do think some due is due to Mr. King and his extensive literary production. But, first, a little background. Like many, I read a lot of King’s early novels when I was a prepubescent and post pubescent teenager and enjoyed them a lot at the time. I mean they had lots of naughty words and naughty people doing naughty things (sometimes to their naughty bits)...what’s not to love sports fans. During that period I read quite a few Kingers including: ,,,, (OUCH on this epic failure),, and. However, after the (more on that series below), I drifted away from reading in general as other things began to take precedence in my advancing teen years...namely... This period of literary latency lasted about 15 years (though I did still read during this time, but it was very sporatic). Then about 7 years ago, I began hard core reading again like a born again bibliophile. This hot, steamy love of books soon blossomed into an uncontrollable addiction once I joined Goodreads (YES, THAT MAKES ALL OF YOU READING THIS ENABLERS!!!). Well, once I reattached myself to the reading world, my primary King-related focus was completing the Dark Tower series in all its delicious awesomeness. Okay, so after finishing the Dark Tower for the 2nd time (I am currently up to book 4 on my 3rd go around with the Dark Tower Group here on GR), I decided to read some of King’s later works that I missed as well as go back and revisit the stories I read as a teenager (to see how they hold up to the memory of my hormonally controlled younger self). Which brings us to the Shining which was first up on my re-read list and I am happy to say that I found this more enjoyable this time around. Most of this is due to subtle and nuanced psychological aspects of the novel dealing with alcohlism, obsession and madness were more understandable and relatable at 40 than they were at 15 (go figure). I also found myself thinking of this story as a pretty good microcosm of King’s work (both the good and the bad) as it contained many of King's strength and weaknesses. While I assume most people are familiar with the plot, for those just returning to Earth (welcome back) or just arriving for the first time (NaNu..NaNu), the plot centers around aspiring writer Jack Torrance who has accepted the job of winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel (aka…the most EVIL place on Earth). Now, Jackie boy is a charmer. He is a “not so recovering” alcoholic with serious ""pole up the poop shoot"" anger issues and a MEGATRON-sized problem with authority. Basically, he is your basic angry, violent, anti-social drunk...let's go ahead and call him DADDY. Accompanying Daddy to the OverSPOOK Hotel are his wife, Wendy, and their “clairvoyant” son Danny, whose unique ability is called The Shining. Now Daddy is hoping to use the quiet time at the OverKOOK to help suture his relationship with his family which, oddly enough, has been on the downslide since Daddy broke Danny’s arm during some drunken shenanigans. UH, I don’t think I need to tell you that things do not go well for Daddy or his family once they come under the influence of the Over""Look we just want to kill you"" Hotel. I think I will exit the plot summary and leave the rest for you to find on your own. I really liked the story. King does a great job of creating a superb sense of dread with sides of creepy and crawly in this very unique and layered ""haunted house"" story. For all of King’s less than perfect prose, his occassional LONG ""off the plot"" tangents and a few endings that leave something to be desired...like a good ending... for all of that SK is an extraordinary story-teller. He is among the best ever at being able to suck a reader into his story and the Shining is certainly a great example of that as I was lost in the narrative from the very beginning. There are few writers who can completing yank me into a story and have me forgeting about eating and sleeping like King did here. For example, I was listening to the audio version of this novel (narrated very well by actor Campbell Scott) and I have rarely had 16+ hours of an audio book sail by as fast as this one did. Now understand, I thought the story was very good but was nowhere near loving it. Yet, I found myself listening to it almost straight through, because King has some demon-spawned story-telling mojo that hypnotizes me. Oddly enough, an hour after I finished the story I was actually somewhat unfulfilled…it’s like the book is some form of literary Chinese food. Regardless, while I was listening I was captivated and this seems to be one of King’s gifts. The ability to create characters that engage the reader (both good and bad) and finding the right emotional buttons to press in order to make the reader CARE about what his characters are thinking and doing. King certainly succeeds here and is in top ""page turning"" form as he employs characters that are exceptionally well drawn, including the Hotel itself which is one of the best non-human characters ever. Overall, I think King has created a classic, yet unique “haunted house” story while at the same time including an engaging and evocative depiction of obsession, alcoholism and madness. A good, solid story that is worth reading. 4.0 stars."
The Shining,"Stephen King is the greatest of them all because he really can jerk a tear playing on nerves of philoprogenitive parents like on the strings of a mellifluous lute… He probably tortured more children than all the rest horror authors of America put together. So what happens? About a week later this stupid cunt of a chambermaid, Delores Vickery by name, she gives out with a helluva shriek while she’s makin up the room where those two stayed, and she faints dead away. When she comes to she says she seen the dead woman in the bathroom, layin naked in the tub. ‘Her face was all purple an puffy,’ she says, ‘an she was grinnin at me.’ So Ullman gave her two weeks’ worth of walking papers and told her to get lost. I figure there’s maybe forty-fifty people died in this hotel since my grandfather opened it for business in 1910. Read in the dead of winter while freezing winds weep sorrowfully and wolves are howling outside."
The Shining,"I mean, what is there really to say about a Stephen King book that hasn’t already been said?! I’m sure this isn’t necessary but…The Shining follows the Torrence family. The father, Jack gets a job being the caretaker for a Hotel over the months when it is closed. Danny, the son, can ‘shine’ and slowly things start to spiral out of control. Something dark lurks within the hotel. This is the first Stephen King book I read, and I actually loved it! I admit, I wasn’t overly scared by it like I hoped I would be, but so far I have been unable to find a book that really scared me. It also took me a lot longer to read than normal books. King includes a lot of detail in his writing and I think this slowed my pace down. I wasn’t going to give this book 5 stars, but the Epilogue blew me away and I knew then that it deserved all 5. I honestly did not expect to finish reading the shining with tears in my eyes. After reading such an incredibly dark book, the final chapter was just so beautiful and pure. I had already seen the film many times but the book was so different, it has a lot more detail and substance to it. I have been left feeling really excited to read my next King book! I would recommend The Shining to anyone that loves a Stephen King novel or a good horror!"
The Shining,"King describes my relationship with this book very well: "" His relationship with his father had been like the unfurling of some flower of beautiful potential, which, when wholly opened, turned out to be blighted inside ."" My first Stephen King, and my first proper horror novel will be my last. I certainly didn't expect to be bored, but I was. After 338 pages / two thirds of the book, I decided life's too short to waste on a book I'm not enjoying. If you want sinister snow, I suggest Kafka's (see my review ) instead. EDIT: Years later, a friend reminded that when reading this, I'd sent this message: Bad news: My car has broken down. Good news: I always have a book with me. Bad news: The first sentence I turned to is about worries of being ""stranded by the side of the road""! Worse news: It's my first Stephen King. The basic plot (family alone and cut-off in spooky house) may not be original, but it started off quite intriguingly, with more literal demons of alcohol, cycles of abusive parenting (one physical, one emotional), and a lonely only-child trying to understand the perplexities adult world. The fact the child, five-year old Danny, can read minds and has hallucinations and premonitions makes the gap between what he sees/knows and understands all the greater. The love a child can feel for an abuser is a strong theme early on: """", and he's terrified of alienating Danny. Similarly, Wendy's troubled relationship with her jealous mother is echoed in the way she envies Danny's closeness to his father. Jack, is a recovering alcoholic, still struggling to stay on the wagon (I assume he gives in later in the book), and although he's never had any paranormal experiences before, he seems to experience some here. Or maybe it's clinical. What's the difference between paranormal (Danny) and ""real"" but distorted perception (Jack)? There were also nods to Alice in Wonderland (indirect) and Bluebeard (explicitly). All these ideas could be fascinating and disturbing, but they didn't really go anywhere, especially after things started jumping out at the family. Once the family were alone in the Overlook Hotel, it became increasingly and infuriatingly formulaic: the build up to something scary, then the relief of everyone pulling through with only minor damage, then the next something scary - perhaps a variant on a previous one, or maybe something new - each one just slightly worse than the previous, interspersed with the odd false alarm. The scary things included all the obvious ones and... actually I can't think of any non-obvious ones, but maybe they come in the final third of the book. All this was interspersed by lazy exposition of what should have been interesting backstory: the dirty dealings in the hotel (organised crime, prostitutes, murder) were revealed by a convenient scrap book, and Jack and Wendy's inner struggles with their own parents and with each other are explained like an introductory psychology primer: Jack wondered if the reason he did X was because Y. SHOW, don't tell! There were plenty of weak clichés ("""", a child feeling like a puppet in adult games, Danny being the key to everything - just like the key in a clock) and several weird typos and missing words. On the other hand, I really laughed at this description of a lift/elevator, that """"! Danny keeps seeing and hearing this, and he knows it's bad and scary. But it's a Mystery. With a capital M. The revelation of what and why it meant was the final straw for me: such an anti-climax, and it doesn't even make sense in the way it's described. One of the things I enjoy about GR is the way it has broadened my reading (and deepened it, too). There are many wonderful books I've read purely because friends with similar tastes have raved about them ( in particular). I gradually noticed quite a few friends whose literary tastes overlap with mine rate King quite highly as a writer. I began to question my avoidance of horror and King, and canvassed advice as to which to read. I wanted to enjoy this - to find a new writer and genre to enjoy, and to prove I should have read King sooner. Perhaps that's why I stuck with it as long as I did (that, and residual guilt from childhood indoctrination never to give up on a book). Even Jack, who wanted to write a book about the hotel, skimmed the scrapbook, so that mitigates my guilt a little. I'm still grateful for the advice about reading King. The fact I've confirmed that King isn't for me is useful knowledge, which is an improvement on uninformed prejudice. * ""The bar, where dark shadows sat sampling the tasty waters of oblivion."" * ""That commonplace sense of history that anyone can feel glancing through the fresh news of ten or twenty years ago."" * ""She recoiled from his hot eyes and tried on a smile that was a size too small."" * ""Staring at the door with a kind of drugged avidity."""
The Shining,"The Shining is a ghost story told the way it should be. The characters are strong and endaring, all in their own right. I actually really like Jack Torrance. He has personality, plenty of flaws, and he’s just like every John Doe next door. Stephen King does an excellent job describing Jack’s descent into madness. Danny is another great character. He’s timid and shy and a small kid, but at the same time he’s the most powerful of all characters, with a gift that might be their only chance to escape. And then of course, the most interesting character of all. The Overlook. Because the way Stephen King describes the hotel, it’s not just a hotel. It’s a person, a living and breathing thing with as sole desire to make sure the Torrances never leave. Suspenseful from the get-go, thrilling and terrifying, this is a great novel. I want to see the movie now, but hope that won’t be a dissapointment. This is my first full-length novel read by Stephen King, and I can’t wait to dive into another one of his works soon."
The Shining,"Wow. This book was such an incredible mindfuck, and now I'm struggling to steer back to reality. This was juicy, staggeringly disturbing, and not only did this book have me on the edge of my seat, for the majority of this read, I was OFF the goddamn seat. This was my third Stephen King novel, and out of the three, it's by far the best. I wasn't expecting to be hooked to this as much as I was. I was extremely tempted to book time off from work, in order for me to finish it. From the outset, it was creepy and dark as hell, and certain passages, scared the living daylights out of me. The writing, in this book, seemed to have no limits, and it's obvious that King, is masterful with his words. It's funny, because as I mostly got my teeth into this book at home, at night, I found myself having a glance behind me, just to check nobody was there. It creeped me out. That is exactly what King sets out to do here. He wants to get into your mind, and the novel then affects you physiologically. It takes talent to do that. I don't think ""IT"" scared me as much. I loved this, and it has got to me maybe more than it should have. I don't think I'll be sleeping well for a while."
The Shining,"4.5 Stars ⛰️⛰️⛰️⛰️1/2 A creepy, dark and atmospheric tale which blurs the lines between mental health and the paranormal The Torrance family relocate to the snowy Colorado mountains, after Jack Torrance gets a job as the winter caretaker at the Overlook hotel. It's a fresh start for the family after some hard times, and a chance for struggling alcoholic, Jack to finally finish writing his play. But as they get snowed in, tensions rise, and the hotel seems to take on a life of its own. Jack's son Danny, has psychic abilities, being able to shine, and when he starts having visions, things go from bad, to much, much worse! So I loved the film adaptation of when I was a teenager, but my friends and I didn't find it scary, more funny! I remember us running around screaming REDRUM after a few too many ciders... I had heard that King didn't like the Stanley Kubrick's film, and now after reading the book, I can understand why! Not only was the film a bit silly, I've also heard that it hasn't aged well. It is just so different, and Kubrick definitely took liberties with the script! Basic things like the character's looks and age are vastly different, their personalities, and their emotions. When I first started listening, I could only visualise Jack Nicholson, but after a while, I realised that Jack in the book was so vastly different from how Nicholson portrayed him. Whilst Jack in the film was a bit unhinged from the start, in that cartoonish way that Nicholson portrayed all his characters, Jack in the book had huge issues with alcoholism and anger management, as well as a terrible childhood. He had so many inner demons, and the isolation of the hotel, the cabin fever, plus family tensions drove him slowly into madness. Wendy was also portrayed differently, we laughed at her in the film, where she was so weak, but in the book, she's much stronger, and just wants her family to be ok. In addition, the film showcased Jack as the star, whereas the book showcased Jack too, but also Danny, Wendy and Dick Hallorann. I was surprised to find that the ending was vastly different, and that certain iconic moments from the film didn't occur at all in the book. definitely felt like a family drama, as well as a horror to me. The focus on both Jack and Wendy's childhoods showed how much they can affect you when you start your own family. Particularly Jack's relationship with his father, and Wendy's relationship with her mother. At times I hated Jack, but I also pitied him, as he was as much as a victim as Wendy and Danny. Other times he made me laugh, as we would hear him say one thing, and then hear his inner dialogue say something else entirely! I really thought that was clever, where we had dialogue, but also got inside the character's heads to see what they really thought, felt, and believed. I can't write a review without mentioning the Overlook hotel... It was a character itself really, so menacing, gradually becoming more violent as the book progressed! It really was a sinister place, and I constantly felt like danger was luring somewhere! The tension from being confined in such an isolated place built marvellously, putting me on edge, and as a reader you wonder, what things mentioned were ghosts, and what were hallucinations?! The descriptions were fantastic, I could really visualise the hotel and the grounds, all of the rooms, and all of the dark things which happened there. Gradually, built up the story, then in the last part, it became so fast paced and gripping, that it took my breathe away! I felt so fearful for Danny and Wendy! It was so unsettling! Campbell Scott did a decent job narrating this! His voice did take me a while to get used to, and I do prefer to have more than one narrator, or a full cast, but I liked him! One of the only negative things I have to say is about Danny's age, he seemed older than five to me?! Oh and the language is quite profane, with the 'N' word being used a lot. I am so glad that I finally read ! It is a classic, and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it, or like me, had only seen the film adaptation. I have already started , and it's very dark, but I'm enjoying it ha ha! —----------—---------------------------------------------------------------- I've gone for as my next audible because I was obsessed with the film when I was a teenager! I can't find the cover I'm listening to though with red writing and Danny stood in that corridor with the light behind him!"
The Shining,To be honest I'm surprised this book scored as high as 3 stars with me. I read this one in two days flat. I wanted to get rid of it as quickly as I could manage. But there's no denying it that King was phenomenal with words here. Phenomenal is the right word. He is a fantastic wordsmith. I just thought that The Shining had a tacky premise.
The Shining,"Back in the day when I read this, years ago, I thought it was pretty good but not fantastic. I went ahead and went through all of SK's movies, too, and remembered watching Jack Nicholson in his iconic crazy and thought to myself, ""Hey! This guy is freaking crazy! I love it!"" And now. I saw the Ready Player One movie with so many scenes right from that old film and had to rewatch the original Kubrick film and read the original novel again for *very* good measure since I'm back on an SK kick. I watched that movie a few days ago and thought to myself, ""This is a really bad movie. I still think that Jack is pretty awesome, but no matter how cool he is, it can't save this film."" And then I read the original book, keeping in mind what SK's thoughts were on the Kubrick film, as remembered so iconically through RPO. He despised it. And as I read The Shining, trying to keep an open mind, I realized something. The Shining is Really, Really Good. Gorgeous details, imagery that blows me away, thoroughly amazing characterization, depth, beauty, and such a great rising unease. I loved Jack in the book. I loved Danny in the book. I loved Halloran in the book. Wendy had a moment or two. But what I loved the most was the Hotel and all its creepy secrets, its depth, its horror. You might say the worldbuilding in this was something pretty damn amazing. And then it hit me. The Kubrick film is a dumpster fire trapped in a bubbling lake of poo. It CRAPPED ON EVERYTHING that made the book great!!!!! Jack in the book went nuts, sure, but the underlying message that ""normal"" novelists writing ""normal"" books are inherently batshit insane in comparison to ""horror"" novelists is as clear as day! Seriously, there's enough story in this book to choke an ox and put any mainstream novel to shame. Because let's face it, SK shows more talent for mainstream fiction in this book than the majority of mainstream fiction, and he's just going to burn the whole house down! :) MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Just do me a favor, folks, and skip any screened production of this novel and stick with the text. You will NOT be disappointed. :) :)"
The Shining,"""The world's a hard place. It don't care. It don't hate you and me but it don't love us, either."" My relationship with horror stories is a weird one. I hate them, but my fascination for them always overpowers that feeling. It may take me ages to pick up a certain book or watch a certain movie but at some point curiosity always kills the cat (and satisfaction brings it back.) The only Stephen King I've read before is . I didn't find it either really frightening or exciting, but it was good. And I just knew that would be on a whole new level. So it was. The foreshadowing was the worst. It held me tight in its grip and nearly crushed me. On the other hand, it made the story predictable. Apart from that, I'm fascinated by how amazingly well constructed the characters are. Same thing applies to background details like the hotel's history, its former owners and guests. King also leaves many questions about the hotel unanswered, which is equal parts torture and genius. That's something I really love about authors: when they don't spill all the secrets, so you'll never totally let go of the book."
The Shining,"Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. Mix a heaping helping of exposition, a generous spoonful of backstory, a man struggling with alcoholism and a pinch of scares. Shake and pour over ice. Voila! La cocktail de ."
The Shining,One of my favourite books of all time. Genuinely one of the scariest books ever. I was absolutely terrified when I first read it. I found it super intriguing.
The Shining,"This inhuman place makes human monsters. When Jack, an alcoholic 14-months sober, gets offered a job as a caretaker for an old hotel in remote Colorado, he has no choice but to take it. He doesn't have many options - he's been fired from teaching and his play he's been working on is far from finished. He packs up his wife, Wendy, and his psychic five-year-old son, Danny, and waits for the snows to come. The hotel has a Grudge, unfortunately. And Danny's psychic ability is only feeding the Grudge and making it stronger. As the Grudge tries to work it's way into Jack's mind, the possibilities of any of them escaping alive dips toward zero. ... GRUDGE A Grudge is an evil, murderous presence which is tied to a location. If something terrible happens in a place - someone killing their own family and then committing suicide seems to be the most common trigger - then a Grudge is on the place. This book's Grudge apparently is a conglomerate built up over the near hundred years the hotel has been in existence. It consists of the remains of a Mafia killing, and a caretaker who killed his wife and two daughters and then himself, and a woman who commits suicide after her younger lover leaves her. There's probably a lot more. This Grudge sees Jack, his wife, and most especially his little boy Danny as a kind of all-you-can-eat buffet, personally delivered for its enjoyment. If it can kill Danny, therefore tying him to the hotel, it will become very powerful. TRUE HORROR Well, I don't believe in ghosts. But I sure as heck believe in alcoholic abusive men with tempers. And that is the true horror here. Yes, there is an evil presence in the hotel. Yes, it spurs Jack on to murderous intentions. However, that is not the real problem here. The real problem here is that Jack is a bad person. Yes, he loves his wife. Yes, he loves his child. But he has a terrible temper. I can't even blame the alcohol, although that certainly exacerbates things. But Jack does horrifying things while he's stone-cold sober. And way before he's introduced to the hotel's Grudge. Some examples: - Deliberately screws with the mind of a student he despises. Then denies doing it. - Beats aforementioned student unconscious in a parking lot. - Sympathizes with a man who rapes and murders children. - Has such an uncontrollable urge to beat his wife and child that he has to physically leave the house and drive around the neighborhood so he won't lay hands on them. - He has an extremely external locus of control - nothing is his fault. Everything can be blamed on others. This is very dangerous, especially in a man with temper. He takes absolutely no responsibility for his actions or his position in life. Instead he hates everyone else for ""putting him there."" All this is sober, and pre-hotel. So don't try to tell me it's the drink! Don't try to tell me that it's the ghosts! Bullshit. This man is already someone you should be crossing the street to avoid. It's very tempting and easy to blame all your problems on your alcoholism. I've seen it a thousand times. Because alcoholism is a serious and damaging disease. It is. And if it weren't for the drink, life would be perfect - you would be perfect. Right? WRONG. And Stephen King does a subtle job of showing that here. Jack Torrance's problem - his real problem - is that he has a bad temper. There is no cure for that. Going sober is not a cure for that (although it will probably help). Being married to and bearing a child with a man like this is the true horror, I think, and not all this bullshit with dead people in the bathtub. I don't think that comes through clearly to a lot of people, who still think this is a novel about ghosts. CHRISTIAN Of course, Stephen King is one of the leading Christian authors of our time. Stephen King's absolute belief in God, Satan, angels and demons shines from every page of his horror novels. And this is no exception. Young Danny has 'the shining,' and so does the kindly, black, 62-year-old cook for the hotel. This is described as ""psychic"" in the book, but it's obvious (especially near the climax) that they are God-touched and warriors in God's fight with Satan. Hmmmm, a kind of human angel or angel-on-earth if you will. People laugh and also scoff when I baldly state King's rightful place as leading Christian author nowadays, but it's completely true. Actually, one of my atheist friends refuses to read King's books for just this reason. ""King's books are extremely boring,"" he says. ""It's always the same. Deep, deep evil from hell crops up and God must send someone (usually a little boy, although sometimes that changes) to act as His representative and stop Satan from gaining a foothold."" This neatly sums up 98% of King's horror plots. ABUSIVE PARENTS It's doubly hard for Jack and Wendy to parent because both of them come from abusive homes. Jack's father frequently beat his wife and children, putting them in the hospital. Wendy's mother is verbally and emotionally abusive, ripping Wendy and her accomplishments to shreds at every opportunity. We can see how hard each of these people have to fight against continuing the cycle of abuse and attempt to be good parents to Danny. Wendy largely succeeds... Jack not so much. WENDY I liked this character. Wendy is really put through the wringer, and she performs admirably. I loved her bravery and her struggle to protect Danny. She's terrified, weak, and unskilled - but she doesn't let this stop her from doing what she has to do. Well done. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE - Giant hedge animals coming to life and trying to kill people is laughable. Even a master-author like King cannot convince me that this is scary. It's just dumb. - I really did not like the final showdown between little Danny and his father. It rang false. I couldn't believe he was So, that was very disappointing. Tl;dr - A great book, full of nuance and delicate shading. The writing is excellent, the plot as a whole is fascinating. Besides the disappointing, dumb aspect of the climax which I discussed in the above paragraph, this is an overall success. I'm reading all of King's books in order, and of the three I've read, I would rank them: 1.) Carrie 2.) 'Salem's Lot 3.) The Shining This has been the weakest of the three. But still spectacular. I would highly recommend it."
The Shining,"Recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance takes a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, bringing his family with him. But can even his son Danny's special gift, The Shining, stop him from going mad and butchering his family like other caretakers before him? Yes, I'm several decades late to the party in reading this but after reading , I had to read my first non-Dark Tower Stephen King book in years to see how the old man did horror back in the day. I'm not sure this was such a good idea. This book isn't very long but felt like it took a few ice ages for anything to happen. Sure, there were some creepy parts, most of them involving Jack or Danny and the Overlook's ghosts. I think if I hadn't seen the movie first, the book would have been much more enjoyable for me. I think the advantage the movie has over the book is that a third of the time isn't spent delving into Jack Torrance's past. In the movie, we know he's balanced precariously on the razor's edge of madness the first instant we see him and no one in their right mind would want to spend any length of time locked up with him. In the book, we witness the downhill slide for hundreds of pages. The biggest advantage the book has over the movie: the mom is hot and not played by Shelley Duvall. That's all I have to say about that."
The Shining,"The first time I read The Shining was in High School, it was the second Stephen King novel I read. I loved it, I loved the creepy horror aspects of the book and I liked the book much more than I liked the movie. As I continued my Stephen King binge I decided to go back and reread this classic. As an adult I still loved this book but for a different reason. This go around it was the non supernatural aspects that appealed to me most. Jack Torrance our villain was already barely hanging on to his sobriety and sanity before this book even began. The Overlook Hotel didn't make him crazy, it just gave him the final push. Jack would have snapped anyway. Jack was an unemployed recovering alcoholic with a nasty temper. The Overlook just brought out the monster hidden inside him. Stephen King is at his best when he uses real life horror with supernatural horror. Chances are you will never see a ghost or spend a night in a Hotel like The Overlook but people like Jack Torrance really exist. In the news right now is a story about a man who murdered his pregnant wife and 2 small children. I highly doubt a supernatural force made him do it. The Shining is an All- Time classic and it deserves all the hype it gets. If you've never read a King novel The Shining is a good place to start.

The Shining,Could've been about 100 pages shorter. The middle section was kind of boring. But the last 20%....WOW. Totally had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to watch the film version even if it's totally different. I'm sure it'll be hair-raising. 3.5 stars
The Shining,Million stars. I’m overwhelmed. Review to come.
The Shining,"On my journey to reading/re-reading all of SK's books in publication order, this was a re-read but The Shining is always a joy to re-visit not one of my all time favourites but still incredible. A stunning piece of writing and please don’t go off the film for this one it does it no justice (and I quite like the film) It’s hard to believe this is just a story whilst reading as no matter how far-fetched it seems it appears so real and really makes you think it might have happened. It is such a scary story and its popularity isn’t undeserved. I first read this book as a young teen and re-read in my 20’s and I loved it just as much the second and third time this book just doesn’t get old and is still very relevant in today’s society maybe even more so. ""Wendy? Darling? Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in."" ""Small children are great accepters. They don’t understand shame, or the need to hide things."" ""If you're going into a very dark place, then you should take a bright light, and shine it on everything. If you don't want to see, why in God's name would you dare the dark at all?"" This is the book that truly made me fall in love with King’s writing and he really is the KING of Horror. It doesn’t get much better than this book the only reason this isn’t getting a 5 star is probably because I saw the film first so I couldn’t stop seeing the film in my head as I was reading, I also think it drags a little sometimes and I just wanted to get to the climax but it wouldn't be SK without a little over explaining. I can see why do many people hate the film because it doesn't capture any of the character development and misses out half of the best bits about the book. This book is spine chilling and an absolute classic a must read. If you haven’t read this yet seriously WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!"
The Shining,"Delee? Yes Danny... Do you feel bad? No Danny, I just really hated your performance in the movie version of THE SHINING. Really Delee? Yes Danny, I hated it more than anything else in the whooole wiiiiide woooorld. I know this is supposed to be a review of the novel THE SHINING, and not the movie...but I can't review the book on its own. I tried...I really did. I first read THE SHINING just before the movie came out on video- some time in the 80s- because usually if I watch the movie first, it is very rare that I go back and read the book- I remember liking it quite a bit, but over the years the movie and the book seemed to have blended into each other in my head. I had only read the book once...but I have watched the movie zillions of times. (okay maybe not zillions...but a lot). Stanley Kubrick version of THE SHINING is visually stunning- no doubt about it- you can tell that Kubrick was a photographer first and foremost. That is what I love about it, and why I go back and watch it over and over again...but character wise he failed miserably. Danny was horrible- The finger talking , and the voice of Tony made me cringe. Movie Wendy (Shelley Duvall-) was sad, weak and pathetic, and Jack Nicholson- as Jack Torrance made the character crazy right from the get go. I never once believed that Jack ever loved his wife and son. Kubrick also took out much of the supernatural in the movie, making it more of a mental breakdown of Jack's character, than influence from a haunted hotel. So for anyone thinking that because they watched the movie, they know the book. They are dead wrong. I went back and re-read THE SHINING after reading Dr. Sleep- the sequel, and continuation of Danny Torrance's life. I decided it was time to once again re-visit Danny's childhood. There was so much I had forgotten and mixed up having watched the movie so many times. The novel follows Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic and writer. After losing his teaching job, Jack decides to accept a position as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the off season. Coming with him are- Wendy- his wife, and Danny- his five year old son (who has psychic abilities). After a winter storm cuts the family off from the outside world- evil forces from the hotel's past, and Jack's own troubled history- start to drive him slowly insane- leaving Wendy, Danny, and Jack in incredible danger. Stephen King wrote THE SHINING when he was in his late twenties and still in his drinking phase. I think that Jack Torrance was the closest King ever came to writing his own true persona from those years, and I can see why he was so disturbed with Kubrick's interpretation. Gone was the strong beautiful wife, gone was the gifted, smart and lovable son, and gone was the sympathetic main character who tried so hard to redeem himself. Suspenseful, thrilling and terrifying- this was a fabulous read...even the second time around."
The Shining,"It’s not the book; it’s me. This is a fine novel. One of the jewels in Stephen King’s crown; written when he still had confidence in the judgment of an editor. Do you want to see King’s skill in characterization and storytelling? How about chills and thrills? Look no further, it’s all here. What’s also here – and this is why the book dragged for me – was the abuse. Whatever Jack’s reasons for dishing it out (daddy issues, drunk, possessed), it was still hard to process and it made it difficult to warm up to the book. People bring their past into any sort of entertainment endeavor and consequently their experience is colored and enriched (or not) by what they choose to watch/read. Again, I can appreciate King’s craft, but didn’t find this a satisfying or fun experience. Before reading this I’d watched the film a few times, enjoyed it, smirked at Jack Nicholson’s over the top performance and thought that Kurbrick’s vision of a horror movie was overblown but decent. After reading the book, it becomes crystal clear why King hated this particular cinematic treatment of one of his books. First, any questions or plot holes that might have been nagging at me after watching the movie were answered within a hundred pages of reading the book. Second, for the most part, the film was horribly miscast – sure Nicholson’s performance was “fun”, but it seems to come out of a different place and his descent into madness was perfunctory rather than slow and tension building. And don’t get me started on Shelly Duvall, the kid and “Tony”. Third, maybe if the movie was made today and it used current CGI (for the evil shrubbery et. al) it might have been more “complete” and better, but I doubt it. I don’t hate the movie, but the book is a more rewarding treatment to this story by miles. Bottom line, the book is terrific, but I didn’t enjoy reading it. This was a huge buddy read with Anne, Stepheny, Trish, Dan 2.0, Jenn and le Ginger."
The Shining,"3.5 ⭐ Update: Post Movie So, I just watched the film with my fiancé. I swear I only said, “This isn’t what happened in the book”, like maximum 6 times…. Oh, my dear lord, the movie is atrocious! I’m not only referring to the dismal acting of basically everyone except for Nicholson or the shitty hotel that has ruined my mental image of what the Overlook would look like. But the amount of shit that was left out or mishandled so they could cram this idea into a 2-hr movie is mind-boggling. Jack’s alcoholism is non-existent, we get none of the flashbacks about his father, it’s not understood that he has anger issues before the hotel interferes, the hotel’s role in is decaying mental health is barely touched upon, Wendy’s character is reduced to a snivelling subservient mouse, Danny’s powers are not effectively communicated and he voices Tony while pivoting his finger up and down (It’s fucking terrible. The kid’s an awful actor! Sorry, not sorry. It’s all good, he’d be like 40-odd now), Halloran is creepy and his only purpose in the movie is as a sacrificial lamb offering up a vehicle so Danny and Wendy can escape…. I could write a damn essay on why this movie was terrible. If you’re thinking, “Oh, I’ll just watch the movie for this one.” Um, no, read the book people! is pretty much everything I’ve always imagined a Stephen King novel to be, to a T. Whilst it is marketed as Supernatural Horror, I feel like it falls short with regards to its genre definition at least as far as the horror element is concerned. Based off this novel (my sole King experience) I imagine that his amazing success is much more to do with fantastic characterisation and nuanced handling of heavy topics (in this case alcoholism, mental health and domestic violence) than anything to do with a knack for spine-tingling scares. Jack is an aspiring writer. He also has issues with anger-management which are only exacerbated by his strong inclination towards the bottle. After making a series of awful life decisions culminating in the loss of his job, Jack is offered a lifeline by an old friend. Jack, along with his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, head to the ‘Overlook Hotel’ where Jack is to be the full-time caretaker during the off-season, however, it seems that perhaps The Overlook is not satisfied with a simple caretaker and has taken a liking to Jack’s son Danny and his mysterious shine. Let’s flip it and get the couple of out of the way first. It’s been a hell of a long time since I read anything from R.L.Stine but I’ll be damned if this didn’t feel, at times, like I was reading a Goosebumps or Fear Street book. I guess what I’m trying to say is that this felt very much like . I grew up with that shit, so mad love, but it really doesn’t have the same effect on a moderately desensitised old 30-something as it would on a pre/early teen. Unless you have an , I doubt you’ll fear anything within these pages. Though, you may be grossed out once or twice. I have a minor gripe with the writing which was otherwise one of the major strengths of the book. On occasion it feels like King’s voice cuts through the characters. This might seem obvious as an author���s characters are him/her to some degree but when that voice comes through a lot of the characters in the same way, it seems odd. One such example is the use of “Baby!” in speech. Eg. “Burn, baby, burn.” “Cash, baby, cash.” “Human Nature Baby, grab it and growl.” I’m hearing King rather than the character and as a result am just pulled out of the story momentarily. The , as mentioned earlier, are King’s characterisation and handling of heavy topics in a nuanced and accurate manner. as early as the quirky character, Watson, but it truly shines in a deeper way with his analysis of Jack. Jack is an alcoholic that really struggles to control his anger. His insatiable thirst for alcohol is truly palpable and his confused, often maniacal, inner monologue show two very different Jacks fighting for control over the same mind. He is often full of bitter anger and self-awareness simultaneously and it seems to tear him apart, particularly when we learn of his childhood and his own father having the same traits. Danny, on the other hand, is a very believable child. He is highly intelligent, emotionally, for his age which I would say is due to The Shining he possesses which is a kind of Psychokinesis. A mashup of Telepathy, premonitions and a spiritual connection to the dead. At the same time, however, he is so evidently just a little kid stuck in this absolutely horrifying scenario, witnessing his own father losing his mind and trying his best to support his mother whilst not falling apart himself. I have a number of other King titles on my shelves and look forward to visiting some of them at a later stage. Though I didn’t love this one, I’m well aware that King’s back catalogue is long and stretches to a number of different genres. Happy reading!"
The Shining,"I had never planned to read one of Stephen King's best books for last. I started fairly young with Cujo, and then went forward instead of back. The movies for many of his books by then, including The Shining were already out there, and of course I had seen them. During that period, I hadn't known King's feelings on Kubrick's movie, the portrayal of Jack with many etceteras. I just figured the movie told the story, and so that was it. So I read his others, and time goes by. King wrote an intro for readers later on that I found in a beat up paperback copy I own. The cover art sucks because it shows a young boy with a face that looks decidedly mad and possibly evil. I knew enough about Danny to know that the picture wasn't true, but I kept the book around for the intro. In it, King says, “there comes a time in a writer's career when you got to make a choice: either do what you've done before, or try to reach a little higher.” Before I read The Shining, I would have thought he'd done just that with Salems' Lot. But I understand the certain differences he hints towards. Jack becomes more realistic to readers because of his own backstory, the abusive relationship with his own father. Instead of letting readers make the leap, he delves into it for a time. The depth of a plot always matters, or alters our experience. It's not simply The Overlook pressing its will on Jack, but also something deep inside of him. King and Kubrick actually discussed this topic. Kubrick went another way, and that's fine. But also it's not fine because while a movie can be 2 dimensional and still be entertaining, a good book can't be, not really, not if it's to be better than the last, and remembered for so long."
The Shining,"I rarely read horrors so when I read one I want it to blow me away and remind me why I am scared of them. And this one did scare me bad at times but the finale was not what the story was building upto in my opinion. I wanted it to be more scary. Except that I loved the book, the slow build up, the tension, the little details, all was fantastic."
The Shining,how is this book so popular?! it is boring as FUCK
The Shining,"4.5 stars First of all I’d like to congratulate myself for making it to this day without being spoiled! I hate spoilers so much and I go to extreme lengths to avoid them (like skipping that friends episode where Joey and Rachel were spoiling books) I’m just glad I finally get to read this book so I could live my life normally without having to avoid being spoiled. There’s nothing I could say that hasn’t already been said about this book. I just enjoyed it a lot! What a ride it was! It freakin stressed and creeped me out. The setting was so scary, spooky, and atmospherically creepy. We got a haunted hotel. A complete isolation in that creepy hotel with no means of contact and no way out. The madness and hallucinations the hotel started to cause. The idea of the book is just completely scary. Also, the characters were so well written. I loved how we slowly get to know more about them and their inner conflicts and their relationship as a family. The book was just so enjoyable to read!"
The Shining,"As the snow piles up ever higher, madness is making its way through the myriad hallways of the Overlook Hotel. It seeps into the fragile mind of the off-season caretaker, a recovering alcoholic who is ensconced in the hotel with his wife and young son. Things creep here at the Overlook, from the hedge animals in the elaborate topiary, to the pressure valve of the ancient boiler, to the hose of an old-fashioned fire extinguisher. Vestiges of atrocities committed through the years within the confines of the establishment continue to menace."
The Shining,"Some movies are so memorable that the mere mention of them evokes vivid images. ""E.T"" for instance. Say the name and my mind immediately conjures that adorable alien on his bicycle with a young Drew Barrymore, a bright moon rising behind them. Another is ""The Exorcist"". Who doesn't see Linda Blair's head swiveling around too far, crunching as it does, a malevolent smile on her bloody face. Or puke spewing out her mouth. Then of course, say the words ""The Shining"" and most of us picture Jack Nicholson and his lurid grin, head bulging through the crack in the door: "" Johnny!"" Shudder, shudder, !!! For the longest time, I didn't want to read because I was certain I would just see that creepy face of Jack Nicholson the entire time. However, my GR friend Carly read the book a year ago and said the book is different enough that she rarely ""saw"" Jack Nicholson so I decided to add it to my TBR list. She was right. I did not see Jacky boy in the book, only once or twice did I think of him. Instead, I saw an entirely different movie playing out in my mind as I read, with entirely different characters. That is not to say the book differs that much from the movie, though I watched it so long ago that I had forgotten much of it. Dang ! What is it with Stephen King that his novels are so ? I cannot pinpoint why but I think it's safe to say he is a literary genius. I absolutely loved this book, even more than the movie though I didn't find it scary for the same reason most people do. As with the movie, I was afraid of Jack Torrance because of Jack and his own inner demons, the ghosts of the abuse he suffered as a child that lead him to drink and become a monster. I suppose because I don't believe in anything supernatural I was not scared by the house but instead saw it as a metaphor. It is Jack himself I feared, not the house, not some spirit or spirits that make him become evil, that control him and cause him to try to kill his wife and child. It's never the supernatural that scares me but other human beings in their capacity for evil due to untreated mental illness and/or addiction. And that is how I saw the book, as a metaphor to Jack's addiction. The ""ghosts"" were in his own mind driving him to drink and changing him into a different person than sober Jack. And is Jack-under-the-influence a freaking scary person!!!! Holy crap! I don't know how many times I found myself holding my breath, terrified for Danny and Wendy. I did not want this book to end; though it was 660 pages, it could have been three times as long and still wouldn't have been long enough. Thankfully, since it's not a never-ending book, there are many other Stephen King books that I have yet to read. My one complaint is the use of the 'N' word. I think it should have been left out and hopefully if King wrote the book today, he would. On one hand, it's paired with evil behaviour so at least there is that. But did he really need to use it as much as he did, particularly towards the end? Wouldn't once have sufficed? That bitch aside, I highly recommend this book if you haven't yet read it or haven't read any King and want to understand what all the hype about his books is about. It'll take you on one hell of a ride! (I'm not entirely sure what qualifies a book as a classic, but since this book is almost my age and still widely read, I will grant it classic status and have it be my January 2020 classic-of-the-month)"
The Shining,"This is my third Stephen King novel and was a buddy-read with some ""veterans"". In this classic horror novel, we follow 5-year-old Danny and his parents. His father used to be an alcoholic, who eventually lost his job due to a (sober) outburst that ended in violence towards one of his students. As a last chance, a friend from the school's board gives him the job of caretaker for an old hotel up in the mountains throughout the winter (the hotel is closed then and cut off from the world but still needs some rudimentary works to be carried out). After some further people are introduced, we get glimpses into the lives of all three characters and learn a lot about their family lives, marriage and Danny's childhood. Simultaneously, we learn of the hotel's history that could explain the growing sense of unease and darkness as the story unfolds. When the snow has set in in earnest and there is no getting off the mountain, the monster(s) come out to play. I know, it sounds mundane, boring even, but that is because my description has to stay vague so as not to give away too much. We've had ""gifted people"" before in King's books. And we've had vampires, undead creatures as well as evil clowns (not really but any other noun would give the plot of that one away). Here, the ""creature"" and therefore additional cast member is a building. It's amazing how the author managed to flesh it out and give it character as if it was just another human being however. It felt alive throughout the book, like a person slowly waking up from a slumber and then raging. Brilliant! As usual for Stephen King, the supernatural element is well done but the true monsters are the people in here. Actually, this is the first novel I've read of SK's where there is at least one truly good person. Usually, we start liking someone but then get a glimpse into their thoughts or pasts and find out that no matter how pretty the facade, there usually is at least a little bit of rot at the core. Not in this case. That is not to say that there aren't monsters here. Basically, this is a story of domestic violence and abuse, but with a supernatural twist and King's usual depth to the single characters (even the not really important ones). Even the mother, who could be described as a victim, was not without severe fault and I caught myself wanting to smack her more than once. I like how many of the author's characters struggle so wonderfully - in the end, they often lose due to small things that get blown out of proportion. Just like nothings can turn into a huge fight between spouses. The Overlook Hotel can't get you if there isn't at least the smallest bad seed already inside of you and it works great to emphasize what human beings can do to one another and how madness as well as darkness can be and often are hereditary. The angle on addiction was also extremely well done and realistic, showcasing King's experience and research, and made the sense of dread and unease even stronger (maybe because I've experienced drunks and have had a problem with people consuming a certain amount of alcohol ever since). Oh, and yes, I've seen the movie. No, it's nothing like the book and actually a disgrace so I understand King's hatred of it. And nobody give me any excuses like ""but it's an old movie"" because the other SK movie adaptations I've seen are old as well and all better than Kubrick's movie. Anyway, this audiobook was very well done. The narrator had a nice way of slightly changing the voice of Jack over time to mark his slow but sure deterioration and he managed to make me jump quite a few times. So yeah, this might be one of my favourites though it is hard to tell with Stephen King. The interesting thing about that is that I didn't feel as deeply for or about the characters as I did when reading his other novels (I loved the kids, though not their adult selves, in and loved to hate everyone in ) and yet ... Call me a fangirl but the man has a way of picking mundane ideas and twisting them fantastically, before shoving a host of everyday characters into the arena and watch them fight it out. *lol* Every book is a wonderful and thorough character study and I'm loving it."
The Shining,"Full review now up! The Shining is my first book by Stephen King and first horror novel as well. I could think of no better author than The Master of Horror himself for my introduction into this genre. Of course, I have seen the movie version of years ago. Only vague details remained clogged in my memory from that experience, but not much else. So, I went into this with as little knowledge as possible for such a popular book. I believe this helped me enjoy the story more and let the buildup to the more frightening scenes have better effect. Not that I was ever truly frightened……honest, but I was severely creeped out a few times. Stephen King just has that knack for setting up a scene to get the most shock value out of it. There was a few times I was like, yeah, that’s not that scary. But by the end of the scene I’m on the edge of my seat screaming run, run, damn you. I believe what makes this story so relatable are the characters and some of the events that take place. They could be from any normally dysfunctional family, and many of us have experienced some kind of paranormal activity. Of course, not to the extreme point that is in this book, but even a small paranormal experience can be disturbing. Bye the way, the next time I see animal shrubs, I will be turning around and going the opposite direction. Or I’m going in with a Ghostbusters proton pack strapped on my back. That’s the only way. Going into this book I had always wondered why the book was named . I don’t remember the movie ever explaining this, but like I said, it has been years since I watched it. Needless to say that question was put to bed early and was a main focal point in the story. Why only 4 stars? Well, for my first horror novel I didn’t really have anything else to compare this to. I really enjoyed the book, but I wasn’t really satisfied with the ending. Everything was wrapped well enough, but I just had a few issues. I won’t go into detail for fear of spoilers, but that is why this didn’t get the full 5 stars. I’m glad I picked to get me started in this genre. Although, I won’t take all the credit. My good GR buddy Craig had a role to play in that as well. So, hats off to you mate for the excellent recommendation. I would most definitely recommend this to readers out there who have not delved into this genre before. And those of you that have…why have you not read this yet? I will be adding the horror genre to my favorites list, so you will be seeing more horror reviews from me in the future. Until then...happy reading! 4 stars ****"
The Shining,Finally read this horror classic! I've seeing this movie so many times that it was fascinating to spot the differences both big and small. I'm going to watch the movie with fresh eyes tonight and will post a book/movie comparison next week.
The Shining,"“Sometimes human places, create inhuman monsters.” I couldn't possibly tell you how I, as a horror lover since childhood, have managed to live to the age of 31 years old without being seeing The Shining or being spoiled for more than the barest bones of this story's plot, but I'm pretty sure it was thanks to some sort of universal intervention on my behalf because the cosmos knew I would adore this, or something. 😅 Seriously though, I absolutely loved this book! It's easily my new favorite Stephen King title, which is saying a lot, because it's been years since I read and nothing beat that out until this novel. I was fully hooked from the first chapter and couldn't get enough of the claustrophobic setting, the lovable characters of Danny and Hallorann, and most of all, the immense feeling of that built in me with every turning event. I won't spoil anything in case you're somehow like me and haven't experienced this one yet, but I will say that I didn't expect the ending we got, and I was really pleased with it. From start to finish, this was a gorgeously told story that I'm going to think about for a long time to come. (And yes, I'll watch the movie next, but I don't have high hopes. After all, the book is always better, right?) ✨ one Black side character ✨ for: ——— | | |"
The Shining,"I don’t read much horror, but gave this a try because I have loved true crime lately. I appreciated how the characters were introduced, but this book probably gained an extra star from me for simply being about Colorado. I loved the set up of the empty hotel, where known events could be pictured by characters in the location where they happened. This aspect made the reality of seeing ghosts more real to my skeptical nature, but it wasn’t enough. I tried to scare myself with this book but was unaffected. I would read late at night, all alone, hoping I would have trouble going to sleep, but when I got in bed the only things troubling me were the election and my last muffed stroke on a golf course. The ending gave no surprises and didn’t pull anything back together, as I thought would happen in such a famous book. I would have given it two stars but, like I said, it’s about Colorado."
The Shining,"I forgot for a minute there just how much I love early Stephen King. While the movie is also amazing I am so glad I finally made it to this book which has been more than patiently sitting in my TBR for longer than I would care to admit. I love that there is just enough of a supernatural aspect and the creep factor feels completely real. Danny’s father has a last chance - a job as the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel in Colorado. Danny and his mother are going with Jack, but when they get there they find there is more to this hotel than the building itself. Danny has a gift, the ability to read thoughts or emotions and sometimes to just know things, he meets a cook named Dick who tells him he has the strongest Shine he’s ever seen. But his gift also makes him shine brightly to the things that go bump in the night."
The Shining,"As I read, I had to keep reminding myself who wrote this book in 1977. Indeed, I found some things that Stephen King used in other novels. These facts mean that ""Shining"" is, in a way, one of the precursors of all author's fantasies. Knowing him a little, I knew there were some things to watch out for. For example, when I heard about wasps, I thought they would play an important role. Stephen King's narration of insect bites frightens the reader on this subject. I could hear them buzzing in my ears ...! Other things concerning the fantastic seemed to me to be foreseeable. For example, strange phenomena appear when the author presents his characters; we suspect who will be affected and who will switch to the dark side."
The Shining,"And now he was crouched in a dark hallway, crouched on a blue hallway with a riot of twisting black shapes woven into its pile, listening to the booming noises approach, and now a Shape turned the corner and began to come toward him, lurching, smelling of blood and doom. It had a mallet in one hand and it was swinging it (REDRUM) from side to side in vicious arcs, slamming it into the walls, cutting the silk wallpaper and knocking out ghostly bursts of plasterdust: In Stephen King's iconic novel , Jack Torrance has recently lost his teaching job and is a recovering alcoholic. He has a wife, Wendy, and a five-year-old boy, Danny. We quickly learn there is more to this small family than what's on the surface. Danny is plagued by bizarre visions and goes into trances, claiming to see a vague person named Tony when he's bodily incapacitated. Tony is always far off, out of reach, and his origins and meaning are unclear to Danny. Meanwhile, Jack is revealed to have a somewhat violent past, and the reader learns that he is quick to anger, and can lose his temper quite severely. He constantly thinks about having another drink, about relapsing back into the extreme alcoholism that plagued him for years, ever since college. Jack is determined to stick it out, for the sake of his family, and an old friend of his soon cuts him a break and sets him up with a job in the Colorado Rockies as the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. But the Overlook is not what it appears to be, and neither are Jack or Danny... Overall, I thought was a fantastic book. It's not a full-blown masterpiece, at least in my view, because it does have some flaws, but I do consider it to be somewhat of a masterpiece. I'll explain why it is and it isn't. Let's start with why it isn't. Simply put, parts of it are extremely boring, and they drag out quite noticeably. Long scenes of probably at least ten pages cover monotonous events like Jack re-shingling part of the Overlook's roof, or getting into drunken exploits with fellow alcoholics, or researching the long and tediously-outlined history of the Overlook Hotel. I didn't feel all of these scenes added to the story; some did, but some were repetitive or overly drawn-out. There were also some things that made King seem like a horny and/or creepy adolescent, like the bizarre and repeated references to female breasts and particularly to squeezing and fondling them. That became a little deranged after a while, and I found it somewhat off-putting and immature. At the end of the day, it's a bit hard to say ""That's the best book ever! What a masterpiece!"" when there are issues of tedium and borderline perversity like these present throughout the book. Or at least for me it is. Now to why it is somewhat of a masterpiece. Mainly, for me, this comes down to Jack Torrance. What an amazingly executed character. He's actually a pretty terrible person. As I said, he's quick to anger and can be violent, but he also just generally seems like an a**hole. People will be explaining things to him and he seems very disinterested or he patronizes them in his responses, as if he's this huge narcissist that thinks he already knows everything and is engaged that you'd even have the nerve to think he needs such things explained to him. He speaks in a short manner with people like he wants to knock everyone out cold and like he needs serious anger management training. He's just not a very nice guy. But it's how it all comes together and builds up that is so masterful. The things I mentioned are just little things that, along with his struggle with alcoholism, the pressure to provide for his family, and so many other things, combine to make him extremely and believably susceptible to sinister forces and to going insane, which he of course eventually does. It was just so brilliantly developed and built up; you could actually his growing madness, and it infected every aspect of his personal and professional life. Absolutely brilliant. Jack's son Danny and Overlook chef Dick Hallorann are also exceptional characters, and they played very well together. I loved them both. Wendy I found to be the biggest doormat and fool of a character I've seen in some time in a book; she was absolutely awful, and her naivete was so extreme it became unbelievable by the end of the book. But for the most part, the characters in this book are superb, and I doubt I'll ever forget some of them. , until about the last hundred pages, is the absolute slowest of slow burns, but Jack Torrance's descent into madness is among the greatest I've ever read in literature, and the constant atmosphere of dread created and skillfully wielded by King is a thing to be admired. A full cast of mostly excellent and unforgettable characters rounds out what is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror novels I've had the pleasure of reading (although it's not as scary as ). Highly recommended."
The Shining,"The Shining is the greatest ghost story of the 20th Century. I haven't read every ghost story written in that hundred-year period, and I'm sure there are others that some folk rate as being better, but I can't see how a finer and more scary story of a haunting could have been written than this one. (If you have suggestions I'd love to hear them) This novel is Stephen King at his absolute best. It's the perfect intersection of his mastery of story, his command of the horrific and his flair for tension. You most likely know the story already. Jack Torrance, a flailing, alcoholic writer with a troubled past takes a job as the winter season caretaker at The Overlook Hotel in Colorado, a huge, long-halled and echoing building. He and wife (Wendy) and his son (Danny) move into the hotel, and he settles in to write, hoping that the peace and lack of distraction will help him create something great while the snow piles up outside, cutting them off from the world. Danny, although he is only five years old, is touched with a gift. He's a shiner, someone with an extra-sensory ability. He can perceive things from the past, foresee some events and is aware of things that lurk on the edges of reality, out of the sight of ordinary people. Very soon he begins to sense that The Overlook is a malignant, corrupting place, a place that will seduce his father into homicidal madness. As the Hotel begins to lure Jack into the darkness his wife and son must struggle to survive inside their vast wintery prison. I know, I know. The way I've described it makes it sound hokey, like a twilight zone episode or a jump-scare b-movie plot. Trust me though, like so many things it's the way it's done that matters, not the subject matter, and this story is told superbly. King writes an alcoholic writer like no-one else (he lived that life, and it shows on the page) and he chronicles Jack's corruption and Danny's connection with the evil that has been done in his new home in ways that will genuinely chill you. I challenge you not feel a touch of fear reading this one, particularly after sundown. I definitely felt my own anxiety rise as the shadows outside lengthened. You get double points if you can manage reading it on a cold winter's night. I read this book when I was a teenager and re-read it as an adult, something I almost never do. Both times I was equally as chilled as I was awed. If you've never read King, this is where you should start. If you've only seen Kubrick's film, read this novel. The movie is good, but the book is a masterpiece. This one deserves more than stars - I give it five menacing REDRUMs."
The Shining,I always felt this was far more scary than the 80's movie. The story is claustrophobic and you feel very trapped with this madman. It is such a scary story. It is one of Stephen's better early works. Leaving out all the ghosts and getyous I would enjoy being somewhere for Winter snowed in for one year. I could read and write. Retirement goals. This book does what it intends and it is entertaining. This is the apex of the haunted house genre.
The Shining,"CW/TW: alcoholism, physical violence, casual homophobia, casual racism, mentions of past domestic abuse, strong language ""Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win."" — Aspiring writer badly needs a brand-new start which perfectly came as a job offer as the off-season caretaker of the old and atmospheric situated in the Colorado Rockies. After years of succumbing to his alcoholism and anger issues which caused him to accidentally break the arm of his five-year-old son, , and to ultimately lose his position as a teacher after assaulting a student, Jack sees that the hotel's seclusion would be a great chance to reconnect with his family and to work on a play. However, as the winter sets in and as the cold becomes harsher, the picturesque and grand location starts to become even more remote and sinister. Bizarre things start occurring yet the only one who can notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny, blessed with extraordinary psychic abilities of reading minds, experiencing premonitions, and clairvoyance otherwise known as . Forty-three years after its first publication, Stephen King's iconic novel still manages to stupefy and blind its readers with its brightly deep characterization and masterfully gripping execution of the haunted house trope, cementing itself as a rightful classic of the Gothic horror genre. If there is a significant aspect which illuminates King's novels, with The Shining as one of the best examples, it would be his characters. King's exceptional creation of intricate and round characters is what sets his novels apart from other plot-driven horror stories. The mastery of honing the characters' motivations and the ability to successfully depict them through words elevate from a supposedly typical haunted house story to an eerily disturbing account of psychological horror—blurring the lines of what scares are cognitively and humanly induced and which ones originate from the supernatural. It is also important to add that may arguably one of the most complex child characters ever written, as proven by the profundity of his motivations: Another fascinating part of the novel is the surprising yet well-appreciated humor in the form of hilarious dad jokes which successfully lighten the mood before the impending doom of the midpoint unfolds: Moreover, King's artistic choice of figuratively foreshadowing the novel's plot through the use of the wasp allegory alongside manifesting the building boiler pressure as a reflection of Jack's turbulent temperament are among his ingenious writing decisions. These make the novel's prose more layered and complex as it demands scrutiny from the reader. The greatest feat of the novel, however, is its triumphant avoidance of the adverse portrayal of a battered and beleaguered wife. King challenges this notion by creating , the resilient and steadfast mother willing to do anything to protect her son. This deliberate departure from the incessantly-abused-mother-and-child trope is the root of King's of Kubrick's film adaptation of the novel, saying that Wendy in Kubrick's film is ""one of the most misogynistic characters ever put on film"" and that she is not ""the woman that [King] wrote about."" On another note, King indeed humanizes his characters so much that their errors and prejudices litter the dialogue with casual remarks of homophobia and racism, which is an way to show how wicked humans may be (especially when consumed by unidentifiable forces). It would be more successful if such remarks are blatantly challenged, though these may be given pardon due to the nature of the scenes where such occurred. Stephen King's may be forty-three years old, but the years don't dim the novel's shine as its timeless brilliance proves it rightful to be called one of the most iconic horror classics of all time.

The Shining,"I hadn't really realized just how deeply this story is embedded in the collective unconscious until I mentioned to a friend a few years back that my now husband and I were considering getting married at The Stanley Hotel, the Colorado landmark where the movie version of this book was set. ""Are you insane?"" she said to me. ""You cannot do that. I will spend the entire ceremony waiting for blood to start pouring out the elevators."" We got married down the road instead."
The Shining,"Wow! If you have only seen the movie, you definitely should read the book too as there are quite a few scary differences. I must admit that several times throughout the book the image of Jack Nicholson came to mind though. Stephen King's writing is really amazing! NO slow or boring parts here."
The Shining,"”Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” 3.5 ★ when Jack Torrance gets a new job at the atmospheric and secluded Overlook Hotel he plans to work on his writing and spend time with his wife Wendy and their son Danny. but what the family will soon find out is that the hotel has a lot of history and not all of it is good.. to say the least. throughout their stay things start to unravel in ways none of them would have expected and what this all leads to is extremely detrimental to Jack’s sanity and love he has for his family. i can’t believe i’ve finally read this after meaning to for centuries. i was aware of the story centering around Jack’s slow descent into madness and the paranormal take on that was something i really enjoyed. you could almost argue that Jack would’ve ended up this way whether they stood at the hotel or not because of his prominent anger issues and drinking problems. i felt for Danny in this situation cause he loves his father no matter what and despite him having (telepathic/clairvoyant powers), he doesn’t want to believe the things the spirits are warning him of. the only reason this isn’t a 4 is cause of how slow the beginning was and i didn’t get invested until the 2nd half. the ending was seriously incredible though and i can’t wait to FINALLY see Jack Nicholson’s ✨iconic✨ portrayal! i know Stephen King is not a fan of the interpretation.. so i’m curious to see where i’ll land."
The Shining,"So. Freaking. Great. 2019 REREAD Loved it the second time around as well, definitely picked up on more details too, which was a lot of fun. Easily one of the best atmospheric horror novels out there! So glad the upcoming film gave me the final push to finally revisit this iconic novel, and I'm onto rereading the sequel next!"
The Shining,"MY rating: 4.1/5 They call this book 'The iconic Horror' and Iconic Horror it is. They call this book 'The greatest horror novel of all time' and The greatest horror novel it is. I have watched the movie version which is directed by the greatest director Stanley Kubrick and the movie version is not really similar to the book at all. The movie is more Stanley Kubrick and the book is more Stephen King. ( this is the best explanation I presume) I don't know what to say, really. The book is great and I am still thinking about it. I couldn't find any types of problems with the story or the characters but I loved the characters and story more in the movie version. I like it in the book too but I loved the movie version better. Everyone has to read this one."
The Shining,My first Stephen King book! This honestly exceeded my expectations. The character work was fantastic! I also really enjoyed the pacing of the plot which I never really liked in the film adaption. I’m really excited to read more by King soon!
The Shining,"What can I say about The Shining? It is listed among Stephen King's best novels and it was turned into one of the most iconic movies of the last 40 years. I don't read a lot of horror, but I was interested in this one after learning that the character of Jack was based on King's own struggles with alcoholism. I have an addiction to addiction stories, so I was intrigued. My husband had also wanted to read The Shining, and he found a nice first edition at a used bookstore. (On the page listing other books by Stephen King, only two titles are there: Carrie and 'Salem's Lot.) While he continued browsing, I sat down and started reading. I was instantly caught up in the story of Jack and his family. Jack is trying to redeem himself after a disastrous mistake in his teaching career, and his wife, Wendy, is torn about whether to stay married to him. Their precocious 5-year-old son, Danny, also has problems and both parents are worried about him. Although, ""precocious"" doesn't fully explain Danny's gifts. He has psychic powers, and everything starts to go to hell in a handbasket when he and his parents move to the Overlook, a haunted hotel in the Colorado mountains, so Jack can be its caretaker over the winter. Poor Danny becomes the conduit for the ghosts in the hotel, and the spirits also wreak havoc on Jack and his fragile sobriety. I haven't read a lot of King's books, but the writing in Shining is so strong that I could tell why it's considered one of his best. Here are a few good lines: This book is scary.* There is a famous scene in Room 217 that I read with my hand half-covering my eyes. The descriptions of the hedge animals coming alive, and the times when Danny knows he is being stalked, are terrifying. When Danny calls for help toward the end of the book, I was so engrossed I stayed up really late just so I could finish. Whew! Since I am nearly four decades late in reading this book, most people seeing this review have likely already read it, but if you haven't and if you want a good literary scare, I highly recommend it. ""He would write it for the reason he felt that all great literature, fiction and nonfiction, was written: truth comes out, in the end it always comes out. He would write it because he felt he had to."" I was reading this book when I found out my mother had cancer, and after one night during which she collapsed, I said to my husband, ""I don't know which is scarier: The Shining or what's happening with my mom."" He nodded gravely."
The Shining,"Jack Torrance has been given the chance to turn his life around after being hired to work as a winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. Isolated from the rest of the world for months, Jack plans to rekindle his relationship with his wife Wendy and his son Danny all the while fighting his brutal alcohol addiction and working out his anger issues. Unfortunately for Jack, the Overlook Hotel has other plans for him and his family. The hotel is haunted by evil spirits with violent and tragic histories, taking advantage of Jack's own troubled past and his son Danny's psychic abilities. A peaceful winter getaway might just become a true nightmare. The Shining is a fantastic exploration of the struggles of alcoholism, financial ruin and past tragedies constantly coming back to bite you where it hurts most. It's about the dangerous cycle of addiction, following in the footsteps of your abusers and seeing how it comes back to hurt you and everyone around you. The fashion in which the basic elements of normal, human struggles is depicted in this book is far scarier than any ghost or even the Overlook Hotel itself. The family drama between Jack, Wendy and Danny had me constantly upset and on the edge. Jack is a beat-down, broken and pitiful man down on his luck. He says and does some pretty horrible and disgusting things, but I developed a soft spot for him the more I learned about his troubles and what made him the way he is. He's not a good guy at all, but almost everyone can find something about him that's uncomfortably relatable. He represents the bad parts of ourselves that we don't like to admit exists. Most of the time we can keep him in check, but sometimes he breaks through the cracks in our darkest and most vulnerable moments. It's a slow burner with a lot of heart. As dark and depressing as it is, the overall message behind the story is an uplifting one. We don't have to allow ourselves to be defined by our pasts, our guilt, or the mistakes of the ones who raised us. We can always try our best to go in the opposite direction and set a good example for others. Danny's friendship with Hallorann is also awesome and wholesome. Two psychic boys from totally different generations and upbringings finding a meaningful connection through their mutual struggles. My rating: 5/5"
The Shining,"3.25 stars “Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” As someone who only watched the movie and just recently started Stephen King, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I was so so wrong in the best way possible. Jack Torrance, an ex-drunk, gets a job in the Overlook hotel as a winter caretaker.The Overlook isn't just a hotel though... and his son is no ordinary boy. Trigger warning: . A lot of it in the last fifth or so. It made me uncomfortable reading it. I know it was meant to be showing the ""bad guys"" but I am just not ok with it. The fact that it was a different time when this was published can't really change my opinion because reading it now, I was just too grossed out and uncomfortable. The extremity of this did lower my rating. This is my third experience with . His writing is very nuanced; with a lot of character. It was hard to get into during my first two reads but now I am getting more used to it. That being said, (I am reading in release order). Scenes are more gorey, characters' emotions more felt, and the setting is more atmospheric. I can't wait to see where it goes next. Something that I am noticing in King's works is that he likes to tackle hard subjects in his books. In it was bullying, in it was religion in the face of disaster. In it is alcoholism. In the very beginning we see flashbacks to Jack hurting Danny and later on to Jack's father being an abusive alcoholic. The terrors that the hotel sends on the Torrance family is meant to parallel symptoms of alcoholism. The themes of sons reflecting their fathers was also something that I thought was interesting and I wonder if it will continue with . I really came to care for Jack, Wendy, and Danny. I understood where Jack was coming from and really was happy for him at the beginning when he felt ok. As he started descending into madness and as he started to not be able to keep it at bay, my heart was breaking as much as Danny and Wendy's. If you are looking for a great character-driven story, this is it. I did think that 3/4 of this book was very off when it came to pacing. It was not as bad as in , but it did make it hard to push through to the great moments at times. When the great moments came though, they were amazing. After the build up and the subtle foreshadowing right from the first few pages, the ending managed to tie it all together in a splendid knot. It was one of the best endings I have ever read. I enjoyed greatly. In my opinion it is better than the movie. If you are looking to get into King's work, this may not be the best place to start, but it is a great book overall."
The Shining,"Damn. That was intense. This was my first time reading The Shining and believe it or not I have never watched the film adaptation [yet]. I did however experience Universal Studio's debut of the Overlook Hotel haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights last year and if that was any indication I knew this story was no joke. My in-person book club read Ready Player One last month and we weren't quite ready to leave the experience so we chose as our next read since there were quite a few related scenes. I had been wanting to read it anyway so it was a very appreciated push towards my ""read all the books"" goal which will surely take a lifetime. maintains a mass following for a reason. It's good. The writing, the setting, the massive themes that everyone can relate to. We all have regrets, shame, and our own personal demons that haunt us unsolicited. ...and sometimes they don't. is climbing to the status of a classic for good reason. It was a twisted, suspenseful ride, and I'm so glad I finally read it."
The Shining,"This was a re-read via the audiobook, narrated by Campbell Scott. He is FANTASTIC! I loved every minute of this audio and highly recommend it, even if you've already read the book or seen the movie. *I obtained this audio through my local library. Libraries RULE!*"
The Shining,"2/5 ★'s ⬬ Audiobook - unfortunately ⬬ So, once again I won't be writing a full review at the moment. However, this was extremely disappointing!

The , but nothing to rave about. It took It seems Stephen King just. I can't wait to watch"
The Shining,"One of King’s most famous books I didnt know was so famous up until now as I just recently started to get into his novels. I was eager to read The Shining partly because I did not know what I was getting myself into. Past and actual horrors awaits at the Overlook Hotel menacing Jack, the new caretaker, his wife and gifted (or cursed?) 5 years old son. To me, it wasnt just one of many hunted house story, it was more than that. Its also about a family fighting their own demons as many strange and terrible things happen at the Overlook. The characters Stephen created were amazing and unique. We get just the right amount of suspense, not too much to get lost in it and lose interest. It was perfect."
The Shining,"If you enjoy reading horror, then this book is a must-read! It's a real page-turner! I read it about 40 years ago shortly after it was first published, and it still gives me chills to this day! Warning: once you read this book, DO NOT see the movie of the same title starring Jack Nicholson - it was so disappointing, and at best, a joke."
The Shining,"THE SHINING [1977] By Stephen King My Review 5.0 Out Of 5.0 Stars I finished my second reading of “The Shining [1977]” at midnight last night. I did not read the excerpt from the sequel “Doctor Sleep” since it is my intention to read it in the very near future. First, I was taken aback by the page count since I did not remember this modern American classic of horror tallying 673 pages. Second, I do not have a doggone clue when I read it the first time, only that I thought it was the cat’s meow as Stephen King would say back then. It was initially published in 1977 after all. Finally, it is still the “cat’s meow” in my opinion, after what, 46 years? There is only a scant description of the story you will explore in its nearly 700 pages. Our leading adult male character is one Jack Torrance who cannot look in the rearview mirror with a clear conscience, that is until he has half-a-second to rationalize all of his atrocious behavior away and into the ether. What Jack wants is the proverbial “fresh start” and at least in theory his acceptance of the off-season caretaker’s job of the Overlook Hotel could provide precisely that, if not more (Jack still harbors a smidgeon of hope that his buddy Al can smooth over the sharp edges of the memories of the committee’s recollections of Jack’s horrendous behavior at the school. What does Jack think could be within his grasp? Well, something like his cohort in evil deeds making it possible for the school to reach out with an olive branch and reinstate his teaching position with a provisional clause of course. A large percentage of the narrative is unraveled through the first-person perspective of “Daddy” AKA “Jack” …and was not the “Ripper” of lore nicknamed Jack? Our Jack also daydreams about finishing his book within the walls of the quiet and atmospheric old hotel where royalty and roustabouts alike had stayed. Last on his mental agenda, our “Daddy” AKA “Jack” speculates that there should be time aplenty for him to mend some fences with his emotionally wounded spouse Wendy and their 5-year-old son Danny who adores his “Daddy”. Wendy Torrance wants hubby to accept the proffered appointment as the storied Overlook Hotel’s newest off-season caretaker. Hmmm… It is difficult for the reader to arrive at a different path for the main male character to take. In the matter of the wife Wendy maintaining such a gluttonous amount of cautious optimism within her petite frame is hard to explain to a practical reader. Some amount of her willingness to go is explained by the fact that the alternative is full of bad taste and venom, that is Wendy would need to take “Doc” to her mother’s house. Finally, there is our third family member the couple’s diminutive 5-year-old son Danny who was born with bountiful psychic gifts. The boy wants the right thing for his Daddy, but he has not just misgivings about The Overlook Hotel, but some disturbing psychic information to substantiate his reservations. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old. Any reader of any age with any interest in the horror genre would be both competent and confident enough to spin a decent teaser description of “The Shining” because most horror fans read it at some point, or if not, saw Kubrick’s film adaptation starring the versatile, “can look like a psycho any day of the week”-Jack Nicholson. Personally, I have watched the movie more than once. Haven’t we all? Before going any further in writing my review (trying to think of anything new or different to say when confronted with one and a half-million ratings accompanied by a great number of reviews) I want to be clear that I am not the reviewer who enjoys contrasting the book with the film adaptation(s). At least not when attempting to write a book review. BTW, I want to say how much I liked King’s division of the work using PARTS AND Chapters. In PART ONE while Jack is still at the mercy of what I came to think of as “the mouthpiece” (regurgitating the story of placing every brick of the hotel in excruciating detail) that the pertinent topics of what the requirements of the job for off-season caretaker should be was discussed. And this made for some riveting reading. Ullman recounts his unfortunate decision to hire an alcoholic named Granger for the position and how he lived to regret it. The Granger family was one of the tragedies in the history of the hotel. Delving into IQ, psychosis, cabin fever, and the like, Jack is able to make a case that compares favorably to that of the ill-fated alcoholic named Granger. It was through reading Jack’s true feelings about Ullman (and others) that we come to understand that Jack is much more of a clear and present danger to his wife and child than “simply” an alcoholic. It is pertinent to remember (as Jack holds his rage in check toward Ullman) that he has not had a drink. Jack is afflicted with the most volatile and dangerous psychiatric disorder imaginable in that his rage is only contained with a small safety pin or a piece of tape. In King’s use of the Unreliable Narrator, we learn how easy it is for Jack to believe that he is one Helluva nice guy thirty seconds after he lays someone low. We see, that in Jack’s warped perspective things are done to HIM, he does not do things to others. He sees himself as a good man, husband, and father who only reacts to stimuli that is applied to him. He is a bit of a narcissist, and is devoid of a moral compass. In my opinion, it is only at the 75% mark that things start to simmer, and The Overlook Hotel with all of its negative energy begins to gain momentum and power working through the weakest link. I know I have not mentioned “Dick” Halloran, but readers know that he is one of the players, albeit not a power hitter. The character of Wendy, forgive me, I felt less than warm and fuzzy about on several occasions. I must say that she appeared to be seizing on every opportunity to get all three of them out of the beautiful Colorado Rockies. She should, you say? That was true before they went, or even after they had gone and then the show prevented easy escape. But what about after passing the Rubicon. The” hotel” and its energy was zapping Jack every time it could and if it had NOT been, he would still see that if he pulled the three of them out and abandoned his position as the caretaker then it was all over for him. No money, no job, no book, no fame, no way to make it. The Overlook Hotel comes alive by piggybacking the psychic energy of Doc, the little boy. Wendy, the gentle Halloran, and even the boy’s link to his visions gives the “good guys” aid in the battle. The story is supernatural horrors living in the bowels of the hotel coming into being in this dimension and our little band of heroes taking them on when they are woefully outgunned. “The Shining” was a classic when I read it the first time and allotted the five stars. It is just as stellar the second time around. There is much more detail than I remember, and to be fair, it is a tad too long. But that is a common thread with King’s works. They are lengthy are they not? I am looking forward to the sequel and will read it by the end of this month if at all possible. “The Shining” will never be “dated” or a failure to thrill the young and old alike. It is a wonderful story in King’s quiver of great novels. “THE SHINING”…JUST AS WONDROUS THE SECOND TIME AROUND!!!"
The Shining,"My 200th Review "" Arabic & English "" : 3.5* Knock , Knock ... so it was a hell of a story and it scares the life out of me not coz it's a horror novel , coz in my opinion its not , it go under the genre of a psychological novel . The Shinning most knowable Stephen king novel coz it was on his beginnings after his success in his first novel "" Carrie "" but when the Shinning Released it made king more than a horror novelist . The Story starts With jack in an interview to know about his new job as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel , which he will take of it during the whole winter and also a great start to reconnect with his family and also his writing . so Jack move with his wife Wendy and his son Danny to the new hotel as a fresh start to his life after he lost his job recently but the overlook hotel had other plans for jack and his family . Danny is 6 years old son who got a special gift called The Shinning as Hallorann called it . it's like a gift makes u sees the future and it warns u even Telepathy with other people who have it too , feel the spirit and all of that made Danny Afraid of the hotel and didn't want to go but also he went coz he loves his dad and want to see his family happy again but Danny sees what others can't see . "" But it was a dreadful kind of curiosity, the kind that makes you peek through your fingers during the scariest parts of a scary movie"" The Story is really creepy and King masterwork writing reach the top at it , the way he shows us the problem of the alcoholic people and also how his character keep developing every chapter and the craziness keeps go high with the horror images of jack Internal thoughts of how far the overlook hotel made him lose his mind . But sometimes the novel was monotonous , some chapters events was so slow and it made me get boring a little . The Ending was crazy and frighten in way that makes u had nightmares but over things more than ghosts or beasts , to me nothing worse that the psychological horror .but King gave us the best advice at the end . *** Even Stephen didn't love the movie but Kubrick movie what made the novel even more famous coz it was iconic and a masterpiece , i guess after the ugly series that king made about the shinning in 1997 , he should thank Kubrick in his grave that he made one of best classic movies of all the times no one will forget .

The Shining,"No, I'm not scared right now, you're scared. ...okay, that was really scary."
The Shining,"Yet another book review I’ve been sitting on for weeks, but I feel like I kind of have a good reason this time! Stephen King books are hard to review, both because there’s so much to say but also nothing that hasn’t been said already. And especially since I’ve really only read the most mainstream of his books, including this one, it’s difficult not to be influenced by a cultural impact that’s been around before I was even born. But having nothing new to say has never stopped me before, so why start now! I haven’t seen movie outside of the few famous scenes that have been meme-d to death prior to the internet’s existence. You all know the premise—husband, wife and son move into a big empty hotel, husband goes crazy, wife is screaming, evil ghost twins, elevator of blood, etc. Some of those most iconic moments from the film didn’t actually appear in the novel, and like all adaptations a number of significant book scenes didn’t make the cut. I can’t do a direct comparison because, again, I have not seen the movie, but I also feel as though the complexities of Jack’s relationship with his family were smoothed over during that process too. Because while, yes, is a story about a haunted hotel, its emotional narrative went a lot deeper than that. This is a book about a man so caught up in his own self-aggrandized myth that he would rather burn everything and everybody around him to the ground than have to face his own inadequacies. It was nearly impossible for me to feel anything than complete contempt for Jack Torrance, both before and after he moves into the Overlook Hotel. Was he supposed to be a flawed but still sympathetic character? I’m not sure, but I didn’t have any pity for his situation, only that of Wendy and Danny. In a place filled with actual ghosts and murderous shrubbery, you would think that some of the paranormal aspects would be the scariest parts. But the real horror of lies in the utter familiarity of the type of man Jack Torrance is. How this kind of person believes the ultimate sin in this world that everyone doesn’t stand and applaud his obvious brilliance. And that the world’s indifference or scorn is an unforgivable act that must be punished, violently if necessary, by his own hand. At this point I assume all writers in Stephen King novels are self-inserts on some level, and I see that being the case here. Not necessarily for the , but the parallels between King’s own addiction demons at the time he wrote this. Jack feels like he’s failing his family and failing to live up to his own expectations for himself. It’s hard for him to get back to his work, you know, , and also be the kind of husband and father he always imagined himself as. It would be a lot more relatable, I think, if Jack wasn’t also a piece of shit, but still King seems to give him a pass overall. This book is a product of its time as much as it is a product of its author. Not that was ever acceptable, but it didn’t seem to be a total dealbreaker in redeem-ability in the 70s when this was written. Still, , and that’s for a reason. In the US 88% of homicides are committed by men and 76% of reported domestic violence is committed against women. Wendy and Danny’s terrifying ordeal isn’t necessarily that much of a departure from reality. Other King mainstays, like terrifying kids, a bloated page count, liberal use of the n-word, etc. are all present too. I know the majority of this review has been dissecting Jack and what King was trying to accomplish with his character, but I was still able to sit back and enjoy this book for the most part. It’s scary and unnerving, like feeling someone following you and turning around to find nobody there. If you’re a fan of King’s other books you’ll likely enjoy ."
The Shining,"This was a super entertaining read for me. I just felt like it was a bit long. I often struggle with longer books and so perhaps this is rather my fault, than the novels. When I first tried to read The Shining, probably over 10 years ago, I didn't get very far at all. I didn't give it a fair chance. This time, I think being older has helped as the first time I attempted it, I just wasn't getting it. This time around it made a lot more sense to me. I've also had a little more experience of this sort of genre, reading a few horror books recently. It's also too bad I'm reading this novel so late. I don't think there is anyone who doesn't know something about The Shining, probably from the film. I imagine reading this novel with no prior knowledge would be incredible. After reading this is definitely going on my to read list"
The Shining,"I've set myself a goal to read a few more King works in 2024, as I've enjoyed everything I've picked up by him. He is the king of horror for a reason, and I'm seeing that again with The Shining, possibly his most famous work. Yet again I am astounded by how King manages to craft his characters and the setting in a way where not much happens initially, yet you are fully immersed, and feel yourself getting tenser and tenser. Luckily, I somehow avoided all spoilers for this book, so literally had no idea what it was about. For those who don't know, The Shining is about a married couple and their son moving to look after a hotel during its off-season. But they are not a normal family. The young boy has an uncanny ability of knowing what others around him are thinking, and the father has more than his fair share of secrets weighing on his shoulders. This is about a descent into madness, where the setting becomes a character unto itself. The hotel is a living, breathing space that King remarkably makes feel oppressive to our characters. Whilst the end dragged out a little bit in my opinion, the first three quarters were absolutely incredible, and the end by no means made The Shining less than great."
The Shining,"Hello Readers. Have you heard the tale of the Seven Wives of Bluebeard? Once upon a time there was this powerful noble immensely wealthy.Everyone called him Bluebeard because of his large, ugly blue beard.He had married several times but time and again all of his wives died.No one really knew how. And then one day he married again.A lovely, young girl.Whenever Bluebeard had to go away, he would give her all the keys of his home.He told her she could use any key to go inside which ever room she desired.Except one little key which opened one little door.She was never to use it. She tried to heed his warning.Day after day.Month after month.But at last, she could not stop herself any more.She opened the door with that little key, and looked inside..... ----------------------------- I guess it's human nature.Our inherent morbid curiosity. Mr. King got it perfectly.It was the same morbid curiosity which led our protagonist Danny, to go inside the Room 217.And yup, it was the same one which made me read this book. Hanging inside the room were the heads of the last seven of the Bluebeard's wives. He found...no sorry, that will be a spoiler. Mind numbing, spine chilling terror. I have read horror books before.By God, I have.I've had that phase when R.L.Stine was my best friend.I have read books with these horrifying inhuman, otherworldly creatures. But this book, this book shook me up. Might being the operative word.I'm not really sure. Now as for the story, it needs no introduction.Good for me as I'm not really in the position to describe it now.All I can say is I don't regret reading it.My first Stephen King, there will be many more. -----------------------------------------------------"
The Shining,One of the best horrors I've read (not that I read them too often). Occassionally I like to be scared and while reading The Shining at night I really was. It's a classic for horror lovers.
The Shining,"I envy the soul who hasn't yet watched the 1980 film version of The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick. This may seem an odd thing to covet, considering how terrifying the movie is. Some things you can't unsee and as much as I tried to read the 1977 novel by Stephen King with an open mind, I found myself comparing text to film, discovering elements I wish could've been incorporated into the movie and coming across others I wish the author had omitted at the writing stage. The third novel by Stephen King (following in 1974 and in 1975) begins in the Overlook Hotel, a seventy year old mountain resort in Colorado preparing to close for the winter. Jack Torrance interviews for the job of caretaker. Throughout his meeting with the officious hotel manager Mr. Ullman, Jack is plagued by toxic thoughts, but holds it together long enough to secure the position, a fresh start for the once promising American author and creative writing instructor. Waiting for Jack in Boulder is his wife Wendy, a nervous blonde skittish over the fuel pump in the family VW, skittish over her husband's self-destructive tendencies, skittish over their future and skittish on everything else. Their four-year-old son Danny is uncommonly perceptive and speaks often of an imaginary friend named Tony, a relationship the Torrances attribute to stress. Tony often appears to Danny from far away and shows him things. Tony has a very bad feeling about this place the Overlook. One of the things I love about King and that people who've only heard he's a horror writer might not realize about his work is how little ""horror"" there is in the front half of his books. Jack's abusive father, his own spiral to rock bottom with alcohol and struggles with his temper, as well as his failures as a husband, are explored as deeply as in a work of literary fiction by someone like John Irving. Instead of throwing blood and guts at the reader, King comes at you with his characters. Another thing I've realized about King's best work is that the horror doesn't come from monsters chasing the characters but from characters realizing they are the monster. This is certainly the case in , and with characters realizing they're the freak under the tent and the most terrifying thing going; much of the story deals with whether they can control their wild talent, or the other way around. In , King builds the great haunted house. He gets around the question in all haunted house stories (""Why don't them people just get the hell out?"") by establishing that Jack's failures have his family one temper tantrum away from welfare. The Overlook is a magnificently dreadful place. There are the regal areas the guests see, like the ballroom or the roque court, and the dark places they don't see, like the boiler room and attic. The guest rooms are rich with history. Presidents have stayed at the Overlook, movie stars too, but something else has lingered behind. Children have refused to go in the playground. A chambermaid saw something in the bathtub of Room 217 and was fired for talking about it. A winter caretaker named Delbert Grady went stir crazy and butchered his family with an axe before shooting himself. The Overlook's cook, Dick Hallorann, finds a kindred spirit in Danny with a shared gift his grandmother called ""the shining,"" the ability to see things that happened a long time ago or that may happen yet. Dick doesn't think there's anything in the hotel that could hurt the boy. He doesn't . He advises Danny, ""If there is trouble ... you give a shout."" features some of the scariest shit King has ever put to paper: * Danny's exploration of Room 217 and the thing he finds in the bathtub took me back to being a kid and hearing stories of haunted houses or woods in the neighborhood; I never explored them and after reading this book, am glad I never did. * I liked how Wendy tries to . * The most terrifying thing of all is the thought that your own father, or husband, could slowly lose his marbles and turn into a monster, coming for you. King's toolbox has various sized drill bits he uses to bore clinical psychology into the reader's head. Motivation is clear. Backstory is used wonderfully. Jack and Wendy are loaded with insecurities long before they arrive at the hotel. King illustrates these powerfully and has Danny feed off these self-doubts to form his own unique psychosis. I liked how King uses the construction of an imaginary friend or straw man for Danny to process his visions rather than simply having him have visions. And the story is very grounded in the everyday. Whether touching on domestic abuse, child abuse, alcoholism or emotional instability, King has a sure hand with what should be considered real demons. Comparing the book to the movie. I must say that King wrote a great novel but Kubrick made a landmark film. ++ In the book, Jack's choice of a weapon to is much more organic than the axe he brandishes in the film. ++ Also in King, Jack's unhinged catchphrases, grounded in poison spewed by his own father, are scary. These were not used in the film either. The repetitious way Jack thought about how he was going to finally make his wife or son take their medicine was creepy. -- By far the stupidest thing in the book are the topiary hedge animals, which defy any sort of logic established by King. These bushes apparently have the ability to uproot, stalk their victims, inflict flesh wounds and then return to their spots in the garden. That didn't make the least bit of sense to me. It was probably the biggest story element that the director of and dropped. -- In the book, Danny talks way too much. His dialogue with Dick Hallorann in the kitchen is ten pages long. Though King had a son [Joe Hillstrom] Danny's age at the time he wrote the book, it seemed that Kubrick got far more from the child actor who played Danny in the movie by having him talk less, about his abilities or his experiences. -- In the movie, Danny hides his abilities from his parents because he doesn't want to frighten them. I also found this far more effective. In the book, there are several mother-son conversations about Danny's second sight and even Jack comes to realize his boy has a wild talent. King lays it all out on the surface, too nice and neat for me. -- The climax of the movie is much scarier and has far better visual imagery than horror movie fan King summoned for the book. ++ In the movie, Dick Hallorann is but gets a much happier resolution in the book. I think that King liked this character much more than Kubrick did. +- Wendy is a rag in both versions. She's very much a housewife of the mid-1970s, someone who didn't read in the '60s or go to college, which isn't unrealistic, but makes for an annoying character in a culture where Buffy the Vampire Slayer exists. She just hangs over her husband worrying way too much. -- The epilogue in the book doesn't feel fleshed out. It seems like something King wrote in the office his editor before handing her the manuscript. King has not pulled any punches over the years in his low regard for the choices made by Kubrick, particularly the performance of Jack Nicholson, which is over-the-top from the beginning. Receiving some mixed reviews at the time, the film has gone on to consistently rank as one of the scariest ever made and is regarded as a classic. King got his turn in 1997 adapting the teleplay for a four-hour ABC mini-series starring Steven Weber as Jack and Rebecca DeMornay as Wendy. It does not approach the existential terror of the Kubrick version in any sense. Though the book never fully comes out of the shadow of the movie, I had a wonderful time returning to the Overlook Hotel. I shot through the story, which builds wonderfully. I was invested in how vulnerable Jack grew and how the hotel manipulated that to turn him against the people who depended on him. The hotel was really a stand-in for alcohol and the violence unleashed on his family was very believable to me."
The Shining,"4.5 stars! “Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” A family is hired to take care of a hotel over the winter while it is closed to the guests and weather conditions are damning. Jack is hoping to spend the winter as the caretaker working on the hotel and his writing. His wife Wendy wants them to go back to a normal family. Their son Danny has been seeing some very strange things around the hotel. As it grows colder, the hotel starts to come awake and the three of them will be having a very tough time. I���m trying to read King’s books in the order they were published. This was third on the list and since I loved the movie I was excited to read this. I also have seen the hotel that inspired it a few times and have always been meaning to get around to reading this book. This book has what most people would consider a slow start, but I really liked it. King did an incredible job with the setting and the tone and both kept me completely sucked in from the first page. Obviously there were many differences from the movie, I tried not to compare but it’s hard not to. My favorite part about this book was deep inside, this family loved each other very much despite all odds and they tried to keep together as a family unit while outside forces tried to rip them apart. If you haven’t read this book and always meant to (like me) it’s the perfect, spooky time to give it a chance. Just don’t read it before going to bed. Follow me on ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"
The Shining,"I had to wait a week after reading this to write my review. Why? I couldn't fit my computer under my bed with me to type it up. Fricken terrifying. Terrifying! The entire time I spent reading this I felt sick to my stomach with dread. I was jumpy, paranoid, the whole shamboozle. King really gets into your head with this... He takes you right into the character's subconscious, and as they are slowly driven bonkers, are driven bonkers right along with them. Is it sad that even though I knew it couldn't possibly end well, that I still hoped maybe it would? Probably not, I'm sure a lot of people felt like that. Is it sad that I like to pretend it ended differently than it did, so I can feel less stressed when I think of it? Probably so. It's not that I didn't like the ending.. I did. It was perfect. It's just... It was stressful, ok? Let me live in denial! I'm happy there! Er.. Back to the review. I really don't know what else to say! A year ago if you asked me if I would ever read The Shining the answer would have been an emphatic ""HELL NO"". Too scary. Not interested. But I was talked into reading it, even though I feared it would eat my soul. But as you can see from my five star rating, I don't regret it. My soul may be covered in itty bitty chew marks now, but it was worth it to experience King at his best."
The Shining,"This was me during most of the book: 4 out of 5 stars! one of the best books I've ever read and one of the scariest. I'll talk more about it in my October Wrap Up. If you've been wanting to check it out, I'd say DO IT."
The Shining,"Still one of the best horror books I’ve ever read, and my favourite horror movie, though the book is slightly different from the movie but both are EPIC!!"
The Shining,"Have you ever been building up to something so much that when you finally get to that thing, it just doesn’t satiate you? Has it ever been the case with you where the people around you say such spectacular shit about a thing that it seems that you’ve hit the HOLY FUCKING GRAIL, and yet, yet when you finally hold that thing in your hands, it seems overrated..?? Calls to mind a line from a song by POTF, “It’s how we ” This has been my experience with . For the longest time I can remember, I’ve been searching for a proper HORROR novel that’d make my spine tingle just a bit. That’d make me feel a little more afraid of the dark than I usually am. This search led me to series. While this series has been definitely my most cherished read so far, it was never a true HORROR novel. So the search continued… All my friends, who share my love for books, suggested that I go a-knocking on the fabled doors of SK and seek the HOLY GRAIL of HORROR that is this book. Everyone told me, and I quote, . So, after an ample number of suggestions, I did just that. I picked it up. By that time, I had had my 1st taste of the many delicacies that SK has dished out, in form of Mr. Mercedes. So I knew he lacked nothing as a story teller and all that was left was the story itself. I was ready and hoping for some spine tingling. The story itself is pretty straight forward, a basic necessity even, for all things HORROR, books and movies alike. A small family that has an unpleasant past, bad blood between the members and on the verge of falling apart. But they want to hold on to each other and thus look for a fresh start. A new beginning that requires them to move to a new house, a hotel in this case. A place that, as it turns out, is HAUNTED, always is. Add to that a psychic or clairvoyant kid, who is young enough to be influenced and scared by the supernatural powers and entities. An empathetic figure who is willing to help this family in trouble. Together they fight their way out of a Supernatural battle and persevere, coming out with minimal damage. This is your standardized recipe and all you need in addition to this is a modicum of decent writing capabilities and , you have a good enough horror novel. But all this doesn’t necessarily apply to this book and it doesn't mean I Hated the book or didn’t like it. I did. Thoroughly enjoyed it, as a matter of fact. You ask why..?? Let me tell you in 2 words: Coz its . Well, yeah ok, that was more than 2 words but what the heck..?? It is the sheer brilliance of the writing style that makes this book worth it and makes it stand out in a crowd of similar books. The thing I have come to love about this author, is the fact that he very subtly lets you inside the head of the characters. He sounds like the person whose narrative you are reading at that time. Say one chapter is from a kid’s perspective, you will feel that immaturity, lack of knowledge and resources that a 5 year old would have. Say one chapter is from the Mother’s perspective, you get to feel the underlying feminine voice that makes the character seem real. You can sense that motherly love for a child that only a mother can have. That ""Hate to Love"" and ""Love to Hate"" relation that a wife has with her husband. In effect, SK brings the characters to LIFE, he makes you believe that the people, even as fucked up as his characters, can be real, alive, talking and walking on the face on the Earth. This holds true for all his books I’ve read so far. In the end, it’s as simple as this: The way a story is TOLD, holds much more sway on the readers and listeners than just the story itself. And I personally believe that this is exactly what makes him a top notch storyteller. If you haven’t read this book so far, I suggest you set aside a weekend and get on with it. All SK books beg to be read and what delights they are. I think, I may have found, even if only temporarily, my go to author, a writer I can turn to after a disappointing read, a writer that I can count on to deliver a brilliantly told story that I can relish. Though a sad truth, the fact remains, that while I absolutely loved it, I wasn’t quite scared by the book. And so, my search for a book that will scare me, still goes on… Hoping and praying that soon I meet with the book that gives me the chills. Keep reading, CIAO..!!"
The Shining,"Take a father who recently lost his job and has, amongst some other things, a drinking problem. A mother who thought about divorcing him already and has a problematic relationship with her own parents. And their young son who can see things. Then put them into a secluded hotel high up the Colorado Rockies, which is closed for the winter and has a rather peculiar history of its own. Put this into the hands of Stephen King and watch the madness unfold. King is very good at finding horror in the most mundane things and he’s also good at creating unstable characters and let them destabilize further throughout his stories. He makes good use of his talents here. Plotwise there’s not that much happening, actually. It’s all about the characters and the slow deterioration of their state of mind. But that’s not a problem if the author is able to create so much atmosphere and the characters are strong enough to carry the narrative. And they are. King was able to give them depth and he explores themes like alcoholism, child abuse, insecurity, isolation, how we deal with personal failure and especially how our past shapes our present. So I did enjoy this read for the most part. But not from start to finish. Because I’m not a big fan of the paranormal. And this plays a huge role especially in the second half of the book, while I personally wished the craziness would have solely originated from the characters’ minds. So towards the end this almost steered into 3 star territory, which, of course, would still be good. But I decided to go with 4 stars, because it is very well written was enthralling for most of the time. I alternated between the ebook (in English) and the audiobook (a German translation). And I highly recommend the audio version. Because it is all about the characters gradually going crazy. And with a good narrator this can be a lot of fun. Dietmar Wunder is a good narrator and from what I’m hearing Campbell Scott is as well. The audiobook actually offers quite a few jump scares and is best to be enjoyed late at night with lights out and no one around. Creeptastic!"
Ways of Seeing,"This book is based on a television series which can be viewed on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfB-p... This is a really remarkable series and a remarkable, although annoying, book. The book is annoying because it should have been a coffee table book with large colour photographs and large font – instead it is a Penguin paperback with a font tending towards the unreadable and grey scale reproductions of the paintings that make them almost impossible to view. This is agonising, as really all you will want to do is studying and think about these images for hours. There is something we sort of know, even if I suspect we are completely wrong in our intuition. We have been, as humans, looking at pictures for a lot longer than we have been reading books. For the vast majority of us, literacy is a disturbingly recent invention – perhaps a hundred , maybe a hundred and fifty years for people in the first world. Churches told their Biblical stories as much in images as in words. For a long time even here the words were spoken in a language that was not understood by those listening. Learning how to read images, something so many of us assume isn’t something we need to learn, but rather is somehow immediate, takes an entire culture and also takes perhaps as long as to learn how to read. To understand how images work on us – how we are manipulated by them – that takes at least as long as it takes to learn the same things about how words work on and manipulate us. So, on one level this book is an exploration of the history of oil painting and what such paintings ‘mean’ – mean to us now in comparison to what they meant to earlier generations of people in Western societies. Because the Western tradition of painting is quite a separate thing from any other ‘world art’ traditions. He starts by saying that paintings are both still and silent. This is an interesting thing to say, because how we generally experience paintings today – or at least, learn about them – is through shows like Sister Wendy’s World Tour of Art or Simon Schama’s Power of Art. Don’t for a second get me wrong here – I loved both. But the art works displayed are anything but still or silent. There is a voice track and there is a panning and a zooming-in that turns these still and silent works into something approaching a cartoon. I had never considered the implications of this before. The painting stops being what it is, in fact, cannot remain what it is on the screen, it stops being an object that the artist created so as to speak for itself, and now requires someone to mediate between it and us, to either speak over it (explain it) or to orchestrate it (quite literally, with music) so that we are taught the proper way to read this painting. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we ‘read’ paintings and images, particularly after reading a book called Reading Images: the grammar of visual design. It is interesting that in that book it is clear that linguistic grammar has been used as a way to structure our response to the grammar of images – quite effectively, I think – but this is almost counter-intuitive. If we have had a more immediate relationship with images than with written text, why is it that we need to use the organising principles associated with written texts so as to seek to understand images? Why doesn’t that work the other way around? I know in part this is because language has been formally codified, but this, again, raises the question of why images are so resistant to such codification. Why would it be daft to explain what a verb is by reference to Mona Lisa’s eyebrows? The relationship between being naked (being without clothes) and being nude is presented here in what I take to be feminist art criticism. A nude is not merely someone without clothes – it is almost invariably a female and she is also on display, an object. In many ways she is not really the protagonist of the painting, even when she is the only person in the painting – the other person that is always present is the anonymous male viewer towards whom she is on display. He shows image after image of nude women, and even while being embraced, they are turned to the viewer, turned to their true lover, their fantasy lover, for not only are they the screen on which we project our lust, but also the reason for our weaknesses – they are, in the end, to be lusted over and to blame. No wonder they are invariably passive and languid. After corrupting the whole of male humanity, how could they not look exhausted? And that is actually the point – it is only today that a painting can be seen by quite so many people. They were never intended to be seen other than by the very few. Today paintings are pretty much what Plato said of them, representations of representations – but as such they are a demonstration of just how wealthy the owner really was. Paintings put on display the wealth of their owners – and that was a large part of what had been their purpose. Here’s me, and here’s the missus, and we are standing in front of our house, this is our bedroom, these are the oranges we have shipped in from Spain, this is our cow and, despite the late summer sun setting, these are our furs. The last program in the series looks at advertising and how it uses and distorts the language of paintings, to which it is the last dying breathe of a tradition spanning back 500 years. In oil painting we are looking at the current wealth of the owners – there is a now-ness about these paintings – this is what I look like now, this is what I own now – the fact that it is always ‘then’ in images is something everyone has become more aware of now we have cameras and something Barthes explains beautifully in his Camera Lucida. Time stops in the image, and as such all images are images of death. Life immediately marches away from them, leaving them as pure memory. So, paintings are always about the present and, as such, thus also immediately about the past – the present being just the past in waiting. But marketing images are always about the future, never about the present. Selling something is about creating a desire and that desire is not here and now, it is sometime soon. In many ways advertising doesn’t sell products – it sells envy and desire. As he points out, the rich people in oil paintings are not glamorous – glamour is beside the point. To be glamorous the viewer needs to want to emulate the people they see in the images – but the people who own paintings see themselves – so, there is no need for glamour. To sell product you need to sell a fantasy and that fantasy needs to be just out of reach, but obtainable though an exchange not actually part of the image, an exchange of money for a good, but that exchange is the point of the image. That capitalism needs such constant exchanges and that advertising creates the desires that fuel these exchanges is the open secret of our society. That said, I’d never considered the relationship with time that this creates before – how, to be economically valid units, we need to be constantly living in a fantasy future, while also being prepared to put up with just about any boredom in our all too prosaic present. No wonder advertisement is uninterested in now, it needs to be – it needs to negate now for what is to come. The book also draws a distinction between how we advertise to the working class (the promised transformation is based on Cinderella) and the middle class (the promised transformation is based on The Enchanted Palace) – for the working class buying this one product will be enough to transform you into the princess, for the middleclass investing in this bank will bring you all of the good things in life, which are, of necessity, an ensemble. There is so much to think about in this tiny book and this short series of films. I watch shows like this and I think, imagine what television could have been – but, of course, it could never have been anything of the kind. This is very much the exception that proves the rule. So, to see what television could never have been allowed to be, watch this and then go back to reading books."
Ways of Seeing,"I am not the audience for this book, mainly because I've already read and more or less digested the handful of essays and ideas on which it is based. The seven chapters break down fairly simply. 1: Benjamin's 'Work of Art'--the ability to reproduce images alters the way we encounter works of art. This seems reasonable. Nobody gets to see a Giotto without having seen a reproduction first, except someone who has no interest in the Giotto in the first place. But Berger et al* go a step further: we need to use the fact that we encounter works of art differently to undermine the ruling class's privilege and the ""specialized experts who are the clerks of the nostalgia of a ruling class in decline."" That's on page 32. Part of me, a large part, laments the fact that you'd never get that published today, not even on a website. Another part of me laments the stupidity of intellectuals who put their faith in the inherent goodness of The People. The People does not have a good track record when it comes to art appreciation. That's not to say that people can't learn to appreciate art, only that We are no better and no worse than the ruling class was. We need to learn, we need to be taught, you can't do that if you assume that We are inherently able to do the right thing. 2 & 3: Women are depicted differently from men, and, frankly, not in ways that are healthy for anyone, but particularly not for women. I agree. Which makes it breathtaking to see the authors get so many things wrong, either intentionally (cutting short the bible verse in which God punishes Eve *and Adam*); stupidly (non-Western art forms show women as active participants in sex, so that are isn't morally dubious); or in ways that are, ahem, temporally bound (""Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion."" Seventies!). 5: Oil paintings are bourgeois and generally not morally okay. Holbein's 'Ambassadors' is read as an example of this; the incredible distorted skull in the painting is the exception which proves the rule of oil paintings rather than, you know, showing that oil paintings can be self-critical, as are most good artworks of any kind. In general, the lesson of this book is that all art is bad for you, except the pieces that the authors of this book like. They like pieces by artists who can plausibly be turned into radicals, because only radicals can be interesting (Franz Hals; William Blake). They don't discuss the 20th century at all (I know they know that twentieth century art exists; perhaps, as good Benjaminian Marxists, they don't like abstraction or difficulty). They're also very uncomfortable with religious art, and want to group, e.g., Ambrosius Benson's Mary Magdalene with the absurd and/or pornographic Magdalene of later times, rather than admitting the rather obvious differences (Benson's is rich, but not, how can I put this... naked and disheveled.) Since the authors have a hard time saying what they actually like (vs. what they suspect is oppressive), you get idiocies like this: Rembrandt's famous late portrait shows a man for whom ""all has gone except a sense of the question of existence, of existence as a question."" A little thought would show that this is the sort of conservative pablum Great Artists have been serving up for generations. 6 & 7: Advertizing uses art to make you think you want things you don't want and that you can get them, so you don't need to think about what you really want, e.g., more time away from the office. This is true. In sum: I was sucked in by the idea that this was a book about understanding art. It is not. It is critical theory for high-school readers. Good for what it is, but extremely narrow in scope, and quite harmful for anyone who swallows it whole rather than taking a few minutes to worry away at its assumptions. Harmful because those who accept it will say silly things, and because those who read it and reject it out of hand (due to the rhetoric, bad arguments, or conceptual confusion) won't be challenged to, you know, care about other people. * Humorous aspect of this book: it makes a big deal about how it was written by a group of people, because, you know, individuals are bad, and groups are good. You'll note that the book is sold as a book by John Berger. You can draw the conclusion."
Ways of Seeing,"Way of Seeing, John Berger Ways of Seeing is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer John Berger and producer Mike Dibb. It was broadcast on BBC Two in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. The book Ways of Seeing was written by Berger and Dibb, along with Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, and Richard Hollis. The book consists of seven numbered essays: four using words and images; and three essays using only images. عنوانها: «شیوه های نگریستن»؛ «شیوه های دیدن»؛ «شیوه های نگاه»؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: از روز ششم ماه فوریه تا روز دوم ماه مارس سال2013میلادی عنوان: شیوه های نگریستن؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: غلامحسین فتح الله نوری؛ تهران، ویژه نگار، سال1388؛ در77ص، مصور، شابک9789649461748؛ موضوع: ادراک بصری، فن، هنر، از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20م عنوان: شیوه های نگاه؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: محمد هوشمند ویژه؛ تهران، بهجت، سال1390؛ در160ص، مصور، رنگی؛ شابک 9789642763528؛ عنوان: شیوه ��ای دیدن؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: زیبا مغربی؛ تهران، شورآفرین، سال1393؛ در122ص، مصور، رنگی؛ شابک9786006955278؛ جان برگر در کتاب «راه‌های دیدن» می‌گویند: (مردان به زنان می‌نگرند و زنان به خود نگاه می‌کنند، که مورد تماشا قرار گرفته‌ اند؛ این روزها، دیگر برای دوربین‌ها آسان نیست، که زنان را تنها به صورت ابزاری جنسی به نمایش بگذارند، زیرا زنان کارگردان و بازیگر، از نقش‌های خود برای عرضه‌ ی هوش و قدرت آرمانی‌شان بهره می‌گیرند؛ زنان آمریکایی تلاش فراوانی کرده‌ اند، تا دنیایی از آن خود بسازند، دنیایی که در آن اصل نگاه مردانه، نمی‌تواند از وجود آنها، هویت جنسی‌شان را به نمایش بگذارد، بلکه مجبور خواهد بود آنها را زنانی با استعداد و باهوش به تصویر بکش)»؛ پایان تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 28/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
Ways of Seeing,"First of all, this entire book is set in bold. I don't know what crazy crazyman let that through the gate at Penguin but I just felt I had to point it out right away. It's still worth reading. 4 essays and 3 pictorial essays. Really interesting stuff cutting away some of the bullshit associated with our appreciation of art. It seems like museums are doing a lot of things wrong as well as right. Chapter on oil-painting was particularly interesting but it was the last one about advertising (or ""publicity"" as it's exclusively referred to in this book) that has me thinking. Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it's thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that's grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell."
Ways of Seeing,"This was a great introduction to the work of John Berger, and my doubts that this would turn into something rather dull were swiftly blown away. His approach to art isn't overly complex thus you don't have to be a cultural boffin on the subject, yet its deep on a theoretical level to challenge and stimulate the old grey matter. Ways of Seeing offers not just an idea but also an invitation to see and know the world differently. As the TV series aired in 1972 (four years before I was born) I will likely turn to youtube and try to catch an episode or two, and hopefully find it as fascinating as this book. Bravo John!"
Ways of Seeing,loved this but printing a book near exclusively in helvetica is absolutely insane
Ways of Seeing,"Almost laughably disappointing. Berger obviously has the best of intentions, but his analysis is amateurish at best, pathetically reactionary (almost to the point of seeming to whine) at worst, and largely cribbed from thinkers of far greater intellectual originality and power than himself. For starters, he seems either ignorant of or unwilling to admit that what we broadly call 'mainstream visual art' is, was, and quite likely almost always has been directly tied up with wealth; with commissions, patronage, really with human commerce itself. Visual art isn't some pure, 'virginal' endeavor sullied by capitalism. Visual art is a creative activity which is intimately tied into and dependent on capitalism (really, on wealth) in the first place... and with displaying and re-affirming that wealth. His naive disgust with modern capitalism's collusion with art assumes that there was some magical time when art existed in a vacuum of economic/ideological purity, unsullied by the lucre of having to actually pay someone to produce a canvas or carve a church door or gild something. If such 'pure' art even exists in the first place, Berger provides literally no evidence for it: no examples from non-western European, 'traditional' cultures or even folk arts which might conceivably hint that some people make art for nothing more than their own personal pleasure. As if his shallow reading of these issues wasn't bad enough, he then goes on to make the utterly ludicrous claim that portraits of women, nudes, etc, show us that all women everywhere (and only ever women) are essentially shaped (really, he means warped) by the erotic gaze of male longing and domination. That's a powerful idea. It's also utterly indemonstrable and reeks of cheap psycho-analysis. Worse than that...it's a theory concocted to explain and reduce the female experience, which to be sure, has been cruelly unfair for the vast majority of human history, down into a narrow category of sexual expectation. Has John Berger ever MET an actual woman? What could be more bigoted, what could be more misogynistic, than dismissively generalizing all members of the female sex as simply 'damaged' by the male gaze, as if a single tiny statement was enough to claim to understand the full totality of the female experience and female suffering through out history? And of course, his visual examples of this are, again, cheaply cherry picked...just a few nudes (which to be sure, are pathetically offensive). Berger manages the odd feat of trying to empathize with the female subject in art and somehow making himself come across as an arrogant misogynist in the process. The problem with this book is that underneath it's crummy pseudo-analysis is a person who already knows how the world is to such a level of satisfaction that he has nothing left to discover or even really demonstrate about it. Capitalism? Oh it's ruined art. (Never mind telling us about what art from a non-capitalist culture is like) Women? Oh the poor things, they're so warped by male expectations its a miracle they can even stand up (Never mind that you don't relate any actual woman's experience at any point). Photography? Oh that's ruined art too by making images ubiquitous (never mind really examining photography fairly to see the myriad ways it has changed modern culture and modern art) This book proves one thing above all: the complacent intellectual smugness of the person who wrote it. Look, the relationship between the commercial world and the ever-changing world of visual artistic endeavor is a hugely diverse and complicated subject, as is the relationship between art and advertising. As is, especially, the relationship between gender roles and visual art through out history. Thinkers as diverse as Susan Sontag, Walter Benjamin, Virginia Woolf, Naomi Klein, etc. have all written elegantly and movingly about these topics. John Berger's ""Ways of Seeing"" tries to stand on the shoulders of such thinkers and falls off on nearly every page. Largely because the only thing Berger seems to 'see' is his own self-satisfaction."
Ways of Seeing,"Interesting little book. The author’s matter-of-factness annoyed me at times and I had the sense that he kept looking for the worst in the human nature of artists, art owners and consumers alike. If nothing else, he gives us food for thought. I enjoyed the essay on publicity images the most. For what it’s worth, I couldn’t help comparing Berger’s view that to that of Don Draper’s, leading character and quintessential ad-man of Madmen, as is expressed on the Netflix trailer: I agree with both but the latter is kinder."
Ways of Seeing,"On the top floor in the Strand Bookstore in New York, I saw a self-consciously bored worker show a struggling-to-be-bored kid with his mom to the art table. The worker was like ""well, you need this, and this, and this"" and I realized the kid must be in art school and the worker must have graduated pretty recently. The worker was like ""have you read Ways of Seeing? By John Berger?"" and wanted to have geeky enthusiasm, but kept her eyes half closed and only lifted the book two inches. The kid was like ""no, what is that?"" and trying not to care. The worker was like, totally monotone, ""well, it's really amazing. You'll have to read that. Everyone reads it. Anyway, it's awesome."" Then they went away and I picked it up, because I would like to go to art school, learn 1,000 techniques and become spiritually fulfilled, kind, married, a terrific cook, and understand flowers etc. and make informative life-affirming web shorts that are not irrelevant. In the bookstore, Ways of Seeing was boring but I decided it was my fault. Months later, I found it in a library in Santa Cruz, California. It is printed in bold type for no reason. I guess it is interesting. Oil paintings were about conspicuous consumption back in the day. Only women are conscious about what they present to the world looks-wise. Fetishizing the past helps aristocrats stay aristocrats. Capitalists turned art into a commodity. This is apparently all pulled from a BBC special which I bet is more interesting. At a certain point in your life this will BLOW YOUR MIND, but if you know in your heart that one day we will all hate stainless steel kitchens and be like ""ugh, so old fashioned, barf"" you will probably be like ""yeah, this was okay."""
Ways of Seeing,"“A minute in the world’s life passes! To paint it in its reality, and forget everything for that! To become that minute, to be the sensitive plate… give the image of what we see, forgetting everything that has appeared before our time.” -Paul Cézanne Ways of Seeing which is a series of essays and images, is based on the BBC television series which was broadcast in 1972. The book mainly focuses on how throughout the history of art women were depicted and perceived, comparing classic oil paintings with modern images used for advertisement purposes."
Ways of Seeing,"John Berger’s Ways of Seeing, based on a four-part 1972 BBC documentary series of the same name, is considered one of the most influential and accessible works of writing about art in the English language — and rightly so. Consisting of four textual essays and three picture essays bereft of text, this book deconstructs the dominant cultural ‘gaze’ towards art and connects it with the way we regard and ascribe meaning, both to works of art and to the world around us. Particularly insightful, even path-breaking, is the essay on the tradition of the Nude and how it relates to the power (and gender) dynamics between the surveyed and the surveyor. It is here that Berger illustrates the social existence of men as subjects and women as objects: The distinction created here between nakedness and nudity is also notable: One of the most important tasks performed in is that it democratises art and meaning-making, freeing it from the mystification of the art-critic and the exclusive enjoyment of the status-quo (a function also performed, albeit differently, by the invention of camera and the possibility of reproduction – both ideas dealt with in the first essay in this volume). I also found the essay on the Publicity Image and Advertising to be a particularly important theoretical intervention, revealing publicity as both a tradition of continuity and a break from the oil painting as a methodical construction of a new aspirational way of seeing (while seeing the same things: prosperity and happiness), situating envy and glamour as its centerpiece. Despite being written in the 1970s, continues to be a thoroughly important and relevant read, well into the second decade of the 21st century. I would, however, advise a word of caution with regards to its eurocentrism (and certain incorrect notions about art in the East, especially with regards women and sexuality) in some places. Given that one of the chief aims of this book is to demystify and democratise art appreciation, it makes sense that this book appears as a paperback instead of the more thematically-appropriate coffee-table format. However, what makes no sense whatsoever is that the entire book is set in a headache-inducing bold sans-serif font. My second reading of this book was from an e-copy, but the typeset was still bold and only marginally less annoying. Moreover, I’m glad that I read this in an age when paintings can be looked up on the internet, because the miniature black-and-white reproductions printed in the book are barely decipherable, let alone offering a chance for the kind of assessment this book recommends. The Penguin paperback edition of is paradoxically at odds with the book’s intrinstic argument for accessibility; a visual iteration of the value-divide between authors and publishers if you will."
Ways of Seeing,"If you are really impatient, you may go and see Trevor's brilliant review for this book. Otherwise you may wait a few weeks for mine - I don't think it would be fair to review the book without seeing the documentary."
Ways of Seeing,"""We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice."" An indispensable starting point for anyone who wants to think deeply about visual art, its meanings, and its uses in the (post)industrial age. If you're an art lover like I am (my ""art"" tag on a certain largely-defunct blogging platform runs to something like 1,300 images, for an account I started less than two years ago) is both troubling and extremely enriching. Troubling because it's impossible not to feel uneasy once you start acknowledging the commodity status which is inherent to virtually all ""high"" art produced in the age of capitalism, whether it be an oil painting commissioned by a successful merchant in 1671 to gratify his vanity and affirm his perception of the world, or a more contemporary piece fated to become a sort of monetary storage unit for the obscenely wealthy, regardless of the artist's intent or the conditions in which it was created. (Though Berger is more concerned with older works in this short book.) Troubling also because of the ease with which artistic iconography can be used to mold subconscious perceptions, to enforce entrenched attitudes and prejudices, and to lend authority to advertisements and propaganda. (For instance, there's an excellent and much-quoted essay here on the patriarchal function of ""the nude"" in western art.) Yet enriching because—well, to start with, it's always good to be attuned to the realities of the world one lives in, unpleasant or not. But also because Berger himself is not a Hater of Art or anything ridiculous like that: he simply wants us to be smarter about the way we engage with images, to internalize the notion that works are shaped by the context in which they are created and viewed, and to start to be able to pick out what is truly innovative or inspired or subversive in the visual arts by way of a contrast with what is hackneyed, safe, or insidious. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the book's origins as a TV special, Berger is about as clear and direct a prose stylist as can be imagined, and provides some great illustratory images if you can find a copy that doesn't shrink and drain them of color. (I highly recommend reading the book , where the pics are large and vibrant.) Actually, about half the essays are entirely pictorial, chains and collages of images which we are invited to fill in with our own interpretations and associations. The whole thing could be grasped by a teenager and read in an afternoon, which is not to say that it's rudimentary or unserious. It's definitely not. I've been depressed lately by discussions I've run into online about art and ideology, particularly regarding ""modern"" (i.e. abstract expressionist) works: conversations which, like so much web discourse, tend to drain the topic of all nuance and complexity in the rush to arrive at the most ""correct"" and politically defensible position. The advent of NFTs and the emergence of art-generating AI software are also spurring plenty of fervent discussion across the web; in other words, the nature and ethics of visual art are very far from settled issues. Though Berger himself sticks mostly to the block of centuries post-Renaissance and pre-photography, it was refreshing to be reminded of how good these kinds of conversations be, when facilitated by someone who knows what they're talking about and wants to encourage thoughtful examination rather than algorithmic engagement. If for my own part I've been vague about what he actually has to , it's only because I'd rather not summarize such an already-concise and graspable work. Please read it if you can. As for me, I think it's time to dig into some ."
Ways of Seeing,"“There is more than meets the eye” I recently reread Kenneth Clark's Civilization. It was based on a British documentary TV series, from the end of the 1960s. In it Clark offers a very own, but still fairly classic introduction to art. The book of John Berger (1926-2017) and the accompanying TV-series (look it up on You Tube!) was released in 1972 and was the antipode of Clark’s. Berger looked at the works of art very differently, or more correctly: he looked at the way we ""see"" very differently. To start with, he makes the reader-viewer aware of the world behind the artworks, the social context in which they came about. It is an exquisite analysis that he borrows from philosopher Walter Benjamin. Knowing that the 17th-century Dutch painter Frans Hals, for example, lived in bitter poverty when he painted group portraits of well-off citizens, does indeed make you look at those works of art very differently. With this other approach, Berger knocked down quite some sacred houses, especially those of traditional art critics and their emphasis on the creative genius and timelessness of works of art. He was forcefully criticized for it, but it must be said that he himself did not shy away from sharp polemics, also in this booklet. But Berger offers more: he also shows that ‘seeing’ happens in a specific, social context. His analysis of how women take into account how they are viewed (especially by men) is particularly lucid and unfortunately still topical. The way in which publicity influences and manipulates our visual language is also aptly articulated and represented. Berger also demonstrates the enormous impact of new techniques (reprography and the camera in Berger's time), making artworks available permanently and everywhere, regardless of their context, and therefore they are seen in a different way than before. I can imagine that 50 years ago this little book was a real eye-opener (pun intended). Nevertheless, during the reading, the impression came to me that the work is not really fresh anymore. Perhaps that is because a number of his views have since become commonplace. Perhaps it is also due to the layout of the booklet, with small black-and-white illustrations. But probably it’s Berger's rather classic marxist discourse that makes it seem a bit outdated: using words such as ""capitalist exploitation of the masses"", ""deprivation"" and ""proletariat"" now, in the 21st century, seems quite dated and even touching. Times evolve rapidly, and so does ‘seeing”."
Ways of Seeing,"This book though initially written in 1972 is still relevant to the reader today especially the essays dealing with the way women are seen in society. It is composed of seven essys, four use words and images, three only images. It discusses how women are view in society with an emphasis and concentration on European or Western culture. The images are from ads and famous European paintings. Being that I work in a museum and see paintings all day long this aspect interests me in particular. Basically the book is saying that in our European based culture women are objects, men are subjects. Men survey, women are surveyed. Since women are always on display in our society, they adjust their behaviour in order to please and fit in with our male dominated society. I reference this book many times in my own personal writings. What Mr. Berger has written still has value today. Actually in many ways not much has changed for women. We in the USA and Western Europe are a little better off because we can work, make money and have legal rights but that is not true for women in the rest of the world. Living in a Democratic or secular society does give women more control over their lives as opposed to dictatorships and theocracies. However even in the United States our actions as women and men are based on social constructs and society's defintions of how men and women should behave towards each other. Even how women view and interact with each other to the point that women are very competitive, jealous and vindictive in order to get or keep a man. But that is another story for discussion in the essays I have written."
Ways of Seeing,"2007 wrote: This book, based on a television series, explores how the art world of now has come to be by exploring what art was to humans in the past. The theories presented are very interesting and are posed with pictorial references that do very well to prove points. One interesting chapter deals exclusively with the 'Nude' in art overtime. Overtime it has been reviled, reveared, copied, censored, hidden, hoarded and abstracted. Another great chapter deals in the context in which people see art, in contrast to how they might have been meant to see it by the artist. Many pieces are painted as singular wall decorations, but now are hanging in museums next to a hundred other of these decorations. Overtime people now view art online or in sections of video, where a director controls the viewers eyes as what to see through camera tricks and narration. The chapter contemplates and guesses how this might change to experience of art over time. Changing from entertainment, to a more scholarly subject. A very interesting read."
Ways of Seeing,"“The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.” The first essay concerns how much a person's perspective is subject to change based on their surroundings and how the reproduction of art (alias photography) has negatively impacted the collective art-viewing experience. One can easily draw a parallel between this experience and the movie-going experience: how watching a movie amongst an audience is vastly different from watching it at your leisure on your couch. The essay also criticizes the imposing and more-often-than-not pseudo-intellectual culture of over-analysis of paintings. The irony, however, lies in the fact that Berger, while not empathetic with indulgent criticism, most of the time scribes down his thoughts with a definitive, autocratic tonality. The second essay talks about the male gaze. In doing so, the tone often trod the fine line between factual and sexist, but in the end, succeeded in convincing us that the author only wanted to say that it is the way it is. Nudist craft has, for decades, been invariably about the female body and hence, has remained more about objectification than anything else. The third one addresses the capitalist mentality from the 15th and 16th centuries regarding oil painting and how art regressed into merely a byproduct of consumerism. The last one retains as a continuation of that and addresses publicity and talks more in-depth about consumerist psychology, how it is a ramification of envy rather than greed. The prose is rather grandiose and, as I felt, often indulgent. It shows more than it tells (no pun intended), and while it is evident that Berger's knowledge of Western art and culture is quite astute, his text remains woefully ignorant of Orientalist art. There are maybe a couple of mentions thrown here and there, and while there's nothing wrong with a book being only about Western art, there's something definitely wrong with generalizing based on that. Also, this should've been a coffee table book. of"
Ways of Seeing,"62nd book of 2020. 20th April, my birthday. I got this as a present today, and have spent the day, on and off, reading it (between cake and beer and garden sunshine). This is usually regarded as the 'most influential' book on art ever, or at least one of them. Berger writes in a clean, no-nonsense kind of way. Despite discussing nudity in art, or the history of art, or discussing the paintings printed in the book, it's never hard to follow. I suppose someone with even no background interest in art could read it without any trouble. That being said, without any interest in art, I'd say this book wouldn't be for you. Though the book is 'Ways of Seeing' - that is very much in relation to art. A more suitable name may be 'Ways of Seeing '. Though, the final essay on capitalism/consumerism and publicity is very interesting, whatever your passions are. But, as for me, an art lover, I found this deeply insightful and fascinating. And Berger's writing was just an added bonus as he takes us on this short romp through art. There are many reproductions of art inside, and for some reason, the text is all bold. Not sure whose bright idea that was."
Ways of Seeing,"I admit I’m not well-versed in art history and theory, so that may be a reason this book affected me so deeply, but I was really struck by these essays. They’re incisive. They’re structured well. And they truly made me think. They made me think about art as a sign, a symbol, an argument, a brag, a promise, a prison. Berger is very clear about his purview here, which I appreciate. Though he mentions photography and advertising and film, and he draws contrasts to sculpture and Eastern art, the real subject of analysis is European oil paintings and, by extension, the rise of capitalism. There are both visual and written essays, and while I was initially wary about how well an essay told only through images would work, I was quickly won over. My favourite written essays were about representations of women and nudity—touching on appearance, agency, sight, maleness as the norm—and the final essay on advertising, which Berger refers to as “publicity”—touching upon classism, envy, glamour, desire, materialism, and commodification. Comparatively, my problems are rather slight. The book is set entirely in bold, which is weird. The cover is hideous; whose idea was it to just paste the first few paragraphs of the essay right onto the cover?! The images are in tiny and black and white and in some of the visual essays they run across the crease of the spine, rendering them nearly indiscernible. But I think my only criticism of the content itself is that Berger has a tendency to make some pretty definitive declarations, especially about what is and is not “exceptional.” Take this statement from p. 103: “Adriaen Brouwer was the only exceptional ‘genre’ painter.” Hmmm. Berger backs this statement up, of course, and explains why Brouwer was different from his contemporaries, but that doesn’t make it any more than an opinion presented as a fact, which rubs me the wrong way. The best thing I can say about a collection of essays is that it changed my way of thinking—my way of seeing!—and that is undoubtedly true with this book. There are layers to art criticism that never crossed my mind, layers far beyond and beneath the purely aesthetic, and I’ll be thinking about these things next time I visit an art museum. I’ll be asking questions like: who was this painted for? Who and what are the subjects? How are the people looking at me, the observer, and how are they arranged to appeal to or challenge my point of view? What sort of place would this have been hung in before it was brought to this museum? And who would have been looking at it there? And what would they have hoped to show to people who visited their home or abbey or office, to make them feel? More often than not, according to Berger, the answer to the last question is envy."
Ways of Seeing,"If you think you like looking art and going to galleries - ha - then you need to take a minute to read and listen to this conversation Berger is going to have with you. Link to the documentary (which I definitely recommend you watch to supplement the reading of the text): Will add my proper in-depth review of this later (as it really does deserve one). For now, I will just say that Berger makes us think: he makes us think about the impact of images, their history, their place in society and their role in furthering capitalist agendas. He makes us think about the image of women, the role they play in the system, the condition of modern galleries and museums, and most importantly, Berger makes us think about the modern day photograph and what it means for as a functioning member of society - it's all very insightful and he demystifies art in a fashion which is simple to understand as far as theory goes. Very marxist in his views and vocabulary (which I know will bother some) but I enjoyed that part hah."
Ways of Seeing,"All of what I picked up from this atrocity of a Book is that John Berger is a pretentious cunt. He hides behind the fact that he states he's ""demystifying"" art when in actuality he's giving you his opinion on the propaganda of art and how the artist doesn't exist. I must say first and foremost I am a huge believer in the auteur theory and author's/artist's purpose, so this is why I am opposed to this book. Berger is merely under the assumption that all art is just a way for the elite white male population to flaunt and reassure themselves that they are superior to the plebeians. I'm paraphrasing of course, but this book clearly undermines the intent of the artist. In this book Berger devalues the artist by saying that their creations are merely a tool for the elite to flaunt their wealth, as is expected from a contextualist. He only gives credit to the ""masters"" of the medium. Whom he states surpassed all the average form of art by going outside the boundaries of standard commissioned art (Such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, etc). Berger also has the problem of most contextualists, by which I mean he tries to find meaning or more accurately make up meaning whenever possible. One of the finest examples of this is when he described a simple livestock oil painting as, and I quote ""furniture with four legs in the eyes of the viewer that emphasizes the social status of their owners."" Which honestly might have some truth to it, but is more likely a showing of the owner's connection with nature or the artist's connection or attempt to bring together animals and people into the same composition. Essentially what I'm saying is that Berger's book might appeal to contextual art historians, feminists and socialists, but I feel it lacks any serious criticism or review on art as a whole. It is less of a book about how to see art and more a way to simplify art as a commodity for wealthy, sex-driven, elitist men."
Ways of Seeing,"I first read the book in 2000 as a young freshman in a class on Popular Culture and Ideology. I remember being overwhelmed by the wonderful insights of this book. Now, more than 20 years later, I can still appreciate the book, while at the same time being a bit more skeptical of its insights...and at the same time wondering if it can speak to the current moment in history. If I had to sum up the book in a few short sentences it would be this: Paintings and pictures are always for something and someone. Often, paintings and pictures express the desires of capital and the ruling class. When the artist does get a moment of triumph over the medium and its language of power, it is often a hard fought and meager one. Perhaps that short summary has done some lasting epistemic damage to the book and its meaning. After all, one of the lessons of critical works such as Berger's is that life, power, and imagery is never so simple. And yet, in my middle age years, I feel like I need critical and postmodern scholars to be less baroque in their insights and more modern. The short summary, the abstract, with all its obfuscating simplicity is needed in order to give a very ""modern"" sense of order to the world. At a time when conspiracy theories and epistemic anarchy is spreading, I wonder what John Berger would make of flat-earthers, climate change denialists, and other conspiracy theorist advocates. Are they the noble anti-establishment avant garde? I tried to find anything in this book that would speak to our unsettled times. I found brilliant insights but nothing that spoke to my own sense of unease specifically. For that reason, perhaps I enjoyed the picture essays the best this time around. Those chapters where the art and pictures were left without text to speak through me and let my anxieties and thoughts have free reign."
Ways of Seeing,"One-ish line baby napping review: Somehow missed this classic in college even with an art history minor. While some of it is pretty dated or commonplace now, I think that this is in part due to this book/series and some of the essays still pack a punch- that first one has some great lines on nearly every page and the analysis of European oil painting as a depiction of primarily the history of capitalism is a thesis that I think would still piss people off and start a debate in a classroom in a good way so power to it (and indeed I might throw that out there in a class and see what happens.)"

Ways of Seeing,"Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognizes before it can speak. But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. * * * Publicity is the life of this culture – in so far as without publicity capitalism could not survive – and at the same time publicity is its dream. Capitalism survives by forcing the majority, whom it exploits, to define their own interests as narrowly as possible. This was once achieved by extensive deprivation. Today in the developed countries it is being achieved by imposing a false standard of what is and what is not desirable."
Ways of Seeing,"A book about basic visual literacy, with 7 essays, 3 of them containing only images. It's not that he's original... he borrows a lot ideas from Walter Benjamin and Claude Levi-Strauss, but that he explains it in clear, easy language, with examples. The chapter about oil painting was especially illuminating for me, as I had never understood how to tell a ""great"" oil painting from a mediocre one, having no context in which to see them. But Berger here really dissects the historical origins of the form, and what oil really allowed artists to do that they weren't able to do before. Major turn off: the entire book is set in . I have no idea why this decision was made, but the book is worth reading, despite this huge flaw. Another smaller flaw: a book about images should definitely have been printed in color."
Ways of Seeing,this is a semi regular occurence in my life: books i was assigned to read in college that i did not read or did not read with any great diligence and then some years later i come to learn that said book slaps majorly. berger's project of translating frankfurt school seems particularly worthwhile but also it is just a fun and humane engagement with visual art
Ways of Seeing,"""We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves"""
Ways of Seeing,"Read this for my Composition class. Its a great read when first read since his main ideas stand out, have clarity, and are verified (to some degree), however re-reading it introduces the more ""radical"" ideas. In his essay he raises the idea of ""mysticification."" Which is great and all but he chooses to not define it. I had to keep going back trying to find a definition in context however failed. He seems to switch it around a lot. My Composition professor raised a good point- Berger is so against mytification but Is he mystifying art in the essay? He seems to be talking in circles, as some of his ideas lack clarity. It is a good read however a torture to analyze. I think it wasn't even meant to be analyzed. Nevertheless he raises interesting points that must be read."
Ways of Seeing,"This was intended as a companion to a television series, and perhaps it's best to reference it to another well-known book of Big Ideas intended as a companion to a television series, Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth. Given that they are both wedded to some teee veee, they're both kinda superficial. Berger is at his best when he is talking about specific paintings and how they can be interpreted. He is at his worst when he's doing art history for dummies and also trying to do Marxism for dummies, and it (unsurprisingly) comes off as Walter Benjamin for dummies. In the same way that Joseph Campbell does Carl Jung for dummies. I am not a dummy, or at least I don't think I am. So I don't need Ways of Seeing, really (and I definitely don't need Joseph Campbell in any way, shape, or form)."
Ways of Seeing,"Superb. A wonderful, succinct, concise, and pithy discussion of the history of imagery. How we got from the world of the oil painting to the world of television commercials. Great pick for anyone frustrated with --or mystified by-- 'the arts'."
Ways of Seeing,"it’s kinda bogus to me trying to rate a nonfiction book for some reason but this was very entertaining and it’s a great first look into art and the way we look at things that surrounds us from museums to publicity and how everything has a meaning, it’s very short and very easy to get thruuuu"
Ways of Seeing,"Here are some reductive summaries of the seven chapters in this book. Chapter 1: Art galleries are dumb, memes are the future. Chapter 2: Tits! Chapter 3: Men like looking at women, and pretending women are to blame for it. Chapter 4: Uh, art? I really don't know, there were runs of themes but nothing across everything. Chapter 5: Turns out they were all oil paintings. Apparently oil paintings are about owning things, where 'things' can be anything. Chapter 6: Different kinds of people. And horses. And dogs. No idea. Chapter 7: Adverts are a bit like oil paintings because they're about stuff. Okay, it might be apparent that I didn't really like this. Part of this is down to Berger's style, which seems to involve making weird and unsubstantiated claims, and then expanding airily on those claims. There are a bunch of points Berger does this in the text, but they are particularly galling when he does it with regard to the illustrations. Some examples: 1. : Berger instructs that we 'judge for yourself' about whether Hals painted some criticism of the Governesses. Well, I did, and I can't see anything to suggest that, and neither do I come away thinking that I 'know the personality traits and even habits' of the subjects, as both he and the author he quotes suggest I should. 2. : Berger says the two women have similar expressions. No, the one looks sleepy or perhaps embarrassed and the other flirtatious. 3. : Berger says that 'every square inch' of the painting appeals to the sense of touch. It doesn't. I couldn't even tell that anything was meant to be metal until I read Berger's description. My first impression was that the two subjects look staggeringly similar, and the distorted skull is weird and looks like a rendering issue. 4. : Berger says that the landowners' 'proprietary attitude towards what surrounds them' is evident in their stance and expressions. I can't see anything of the sort, they just look sort of squinty. Maybe I'm just not good at the sort of interpretation Berger likes to imagine for art. I certainly didn't get any sense of narrative in the three purely visual chapters, and struggled to even see any kind of point in any of the portfolios. My issues with Berger are larger than simply not being able to see what he sees in art, though. The title of the book is 'Ways of Seeing', and it is hard for me to escape the impression that what this refers to more than anything is the ability of art critics to see their own politics in art, regardless of anything actually visible in the piece itself. This is demonstrated by his own example. Aside from the first chapter, which presented the most convincing thesis (about shifts in the value of art), his textual chapters read like a 70's liberal hit list: he sees as important about art the objectification of women, 'possessions', and capitalism. There is no mention of realism/fabulism or anything important in different schools of art, and throughout it all he adopts a critical tone about the hegemony of European art -- despite including very few and primitive examples from any other source. I thought with the nudes he had a glimmer of a point -- the women are being objectified, and sometimes they are even being contorted so that they can be nude to the viewer. But this is almost a foundational premise of that whole class of art, and it's hardly shocking to learn that pictures of naked ladies are mostly for the pleasure of men. And, you know, for all that Berger lectures about issues with the nude, he sure seems to include a lot of them in his book. And I don't just mean in the chapters discussing nudes. Every single chapter has multiple nudes in it, though they are rarely central to anything he discusses. I wonder whether Berger himself considers his reader to be male? Regarding oil paintings and ownership, his argument seems highly contorted and bizarre, and he seems to stretch very hard to bring in snippets like ""if a man stole a potato he risked a public whipping"" which reinforce his narrative of wealth and possession and oppression without actually having anything to do with any art. Why is it that oil paintings in particular are about 'owning' the pictured thing, when that 'thing' can be anything from a landscape to people to a story to an ideal? After reading Berger, I still don't know why he thinks this, and really I grow more suspicious that he just wanted to make some appropriately Marxist noises. His analysis of advertising is less objectionable -- who doesn't find adverts annoying? -- but seems somewhat unstable when balanced on top of his wobbly oil painting thesis. He makes a series of assertions about what advertising images are, but again fails to substantiate most of these. I think the idea, really, is that you have to enter the book either 1) already agreeing with John Berger about everything, possibly because you're a liberal university student in the '70s or 2) willing to let John Berger just make sweeping statements which you will accept. The ideas in the first chapter are the most interesting, and I think the most well-argued of them all. No doubt the rest is useful as a possible perspective for thinking about art, but there is no real information being communicated here that isn't already communicated by the politics of half a century ago."
Ways of Seeing,"Berger opens this book with the claim that it is going to mostly be an edifying attempt to open a dialogue about vision and art, or at least incite the reader to start thinking for him or herself; it becomes clear pretty quickly that he is of the opinion that all thought converges rapidly & ultimately on the chronic terms, concepts and fixations of academic Marxism. Hastily and speciously reiterating Benjamin (and Heidegger, as these types like to pretend they haven't read), he gives a brief rundown on the way desire and attitude shape vision, notably leading to unfair and usually pornographic depictions of women for ""the male gaze"" (a phrase which Berger coined) ... he then drops the pretension of discussing art and spends the rest of the book explaining the evils of property ownership and, in a sub-McLuhanian waxing, advertising. The common motif in this book is the employment of kitsch, and the banal treatments of subject matters innate thereto, as the principle artwork discussed, such that the reader unacquainted with art will come away thinking that fewer than ten painters of intellectual interest every lived -- and, when occasionally deciding to note their existence, Berger claims that all artists who intelligently arranged their works did so solely as an explicit objection to capitalism. This book, then, is not so much an invitation to thought as an active and seemingly deliberate attempt to instill in its reader a sort of gnostic paranoia, that all reality ultimately reduces to 'rich man bad', and that all art, emotion, and endeavour are ultimately mere functions of this noumenal truth. Indeed, its overwhelming popularity seems to have had the intended effect, being one of many precursors to the current ""post-leftist"" epoch which presumes the same compulsive fixation on these Marxist concepts (which even they agree are untenable and nonsensical, but which it is apparently impossible to stop repeating). It's crazy to me that drivel like this is so popular, and serves as the introduction for so many to the visual arts as a subject ... although this, indeed, explains much more about so many things that strike me as crazy in the world of letters. One could blame Berger's country of birth for such intellectual disingenuity, but he was also a failed painter: there appears to be some precedent for a link between that and maliciously ignorant political mental complexes."
Ways of Seeing,"This was a really fascinating and thought provoking read. The world of art as we know it is consumed by us everyday and is both a reflection of the past and contains a mysterious cultural lens that helps us navigate through different mediums of art. By putting forward a perspective of oil-paintings, nude as a theme in art in light of feminism and publicity as the last dying breath of these art cultures, it invites you to sit and think about capitalism, democracy and what being free truly means and whether the world today has truly achieved that or just pretends it has. We’re often taught to love art and let ourselves be blown away by the interpretations of what it represents, the life it glorifies, the past it mystifies with the promise of gaining knowledge and becoming more cultured. But seldom are we driven to actually stop and think about whether the way we’re viewing art is indeed accurate or in line with the past in which it was birthed and the market through which it survived. For anyone who loves art, history and economy, this short book puts forward an interesting critique of art and society. I’m grateful to an artist (musician) I admire and follow, named Kim Namjoon, who holds a deep love for art himself for introducing this short and wonderful book to me."
Ways of Seeing,"Weird little book. It provides ample visual examples to back up its various points of view, but all of them are tiny, grayscale reproductions of historically significant oil paintings. The diminutive print also really is all in bold, as some other reviewers have mentioned, and somewhat eccentrically laid out. The whole packaging is weird. Maybe they gave this to an intern. Maybe someone was on the verge of leaving on burnout. I don't know. I can absolutely get on board with the views expressed. They run along the lines of developing an awareness against women's exploitation, consumers' exploitation, and so on and so forth. Great. But aside from a few inspired passages here and there, the writing felt a little juvenile and repetitive, and with the general appearance of the book already being an issue, the impression this read leaves on me is kinda meh. Disappointed."
Ways of Seeing,"This book really made me think about how to view art. In particular, the connection between the oil paintings of the last few hundred years and advertising images was something I had never thought about. This book also presents some insightful criticisms of the use of nudes in traditional art."
Ways of Seeing,"The book contains a series of essays, all related to art. I read this collection right after having come back from London – having spent days surrounded by art works. I had a million thoughts about art itself and museums, and art works in museums. I wrote out some of my thoughts and then came across some of the same ideas in this insightful beautiful booklet. Perhaps this is why I feel so strongly towards the first of the essays. Nevertheless, I try here to capture the essence of it, in some quotes that I deem crucial: I: • An image became a record of how X had seen Y. • The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe • If we accept that we can see that hill over there, we propose that from that hill we can be seen. The reciprocal nature of vision is more fundamental than that of spoken dialogue. And often dialogue is an attempt to verbalize this – an attempt to explain how, either metaphorically or literally, ‘you see things’, and an attempt to discover how ‘he sees things'. • An image is a sight which has been recreated or reproduced. It is an appearance, or a set of appearances, which has been detached from the place and time in which it first made its appearance and preserved – for a few moments or a few centuries. Every image embodies a way of seeing. • Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing. • In the end, the art of the past is being mystified because a privileged minority is striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify the role of the ruling classes, and such a justification can no longer make sense in modern terms. And so, inevitably, it mystifies. • Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw it before. We actually perceive it in a different way. • The art of the past no longer exists as it once did. Its authority is lost. In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose III: • [A woman’s] nakedness is not, however, an expression of her own feelings; it is a sign of her submission to the owner’s feelings or demands. • Almost all post-Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal – either literally or metaphorically – because the sexual protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. • Here and in the European tradition generally, the convention of not painting the hair on a woman’s body helps towards the same end. Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion. The woman’s sexual passion needs to be minimized so that the spectator may feel that he has the monopoly of such passion • It is worth noticing that in other non-European traditions – in Indian art, Persian art, African art, Pre-Columbian art – nakedness is never supine in this way. And if, in these traditions, the theme of a work is sexual attraction, it is likely to show active sexual love as between two people, the woman as active as the man, the actions of each absorbing the other. V: • “What distinguishes oil painting from any other form of painting is its special ability to render the tangibility, the texture, the lustre, the solidity of what it depicts. It defines the real as that which you can put your hands on. Although its painted images are two-dimensional, its potential of illusionism is far greater than that of sculpture, for it can suggest objects possessing colour, texture and temperature, filling a space and, by implication, filling the entire world.” • “Oil paintings often depict things. Things which in reality are buyable. To have a thing painted and put on a canvas is not unlike buying it and putting it in your house. If you buy a painting you buy also the look of the thing it represents.” • “The art of any period tends to serve the ideological interests of the ruling class” • “Such a painting is a demonstration of more than the virtuosity of the artist. It confirms the owner’s wealth and habitual style of living” • “Works of art in earlier traditions celebrated wealth. But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth – which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in its tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” • “Each time a painter realized that he was dissatisfied with the limited role of painting as a celebration of material property and of the status that accompanied it, he inevitably found himself struggling with the very language of his own art as understood by the tradition of his calling.”"
Ways of Seeing,"""Seeing comes before words.” Ways of reading - - meaning/ analysis. Personal perspective and context of writing or image. There is a divergence between and art and literature. Such as, if one were to apply Marxist literary criticism (Ideology) when examining a work of art.

Although the examples from its 1970s origin are dated, its thesis is perhaps even more valid today than then: Oil painting emerged just as the Western world entered the era of capitalism and imperialism. The technique of perspective makes the viewer the center of all he (yes, Virginia, ""he"") sees, just as ""Western man"" viewed the resources of the world. Oil paintings, therefore, became a vehicle by which Western man could enjoy, in rich realistic detail, what he owned. Since the beginning of the 20th century, art has lost this patron-satisfying confidence, but its bastard child, advertising, has perverted the view even more by presenting, not what is already owned, but what we should desire to own, thus serving the needs of capitalism even further. Yes, a few cobwebs of Marxism hang about the theory, but it provides a thought-provoking analysis of the convergence of artistic technique and social context."
Ways of Seeing,"Have been meaning to read this for ages. Was incredibly informative and well written, discussing oil paintings, depictions of women and and deconstructing our general perception of art. Loved the picture essays as I haven’t really read anything like that before. The final essay on publicity, signs and consumer advertising is probably something I’ll use in a lot in my academic life and I’m so glad to have read it."
Ways of Seeing,"A determinate and important read for anyone concerned with art, making a handful strong statements that are interesting and important to think about. was first published in the 70s and is derived from of the same name. It's a collection of seven essays that deal with art criticism, how we understand art and how we come to determine its merits, pointing at a lot that should be reconsidered. Berger successfully explains how what we see is influenced by what we believe and know. Reading images feels intuitive to us, since it's the most immediate way of communicating. As Berger points out in the opening sequence: There's one essay which talks about the difference between the and and thematises what would later be termed the male gaze and how those traditional Western oil paintings were a way of showing possession, wealth and status. Those beautiful hairless female bodies were rarely (if ever) about the women themselves, but about what their existence meant for the spectator / owner. In his last essay he handles the issue of why advertisement is so absurd and yet so effective. As he points out, what people are trying to sell us is the future – a future in which we can be envied and desired. It's a depressing thought, but sadly doesn't feel altogether wrong: but the points made were all interesting to consider. However, people who already have firm knowledge of contemporary art criticism will probably be familiar with most of these arguments, so this really just felt like a starting point."
Ways of Seeing,"Pop art-theory (it accompanied a BBC television program, that nicely distills a lot ideas about how we exist with images in the world with a mounting marxist slant channeling some Situationist concepts of the Spectacle. In a book that pulls and digests widely outside itself like this, the first essay felt surprisingly deep -- and of course turned out to be a largely a paraphrasing of Walter Benjamin's Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, which I clearly need to properly read now."
Ways of Seeing,"This book was pretty interesting. It offers a multi-pronged approach towards understanding how images and meaning are conjoined and how our historic development from art as a religious utility to art as advertisement/propaganda has only served to confuse us further. In some sense, we are inundated with images but we are not literate of their effect on us. This book seeks to compel us to not confuse the pleasures of seeing with their sly deceptions. While much of the past art (images) has been examined and studied our current relationship with art, with images, has not been. Instead, we are made to believe what is shown to us, as the narrow definitions of success and motive are foised to our awareness without much critical awareness as to how else to understand what is being proposed. Instead, we are made to focus attention on very narrow parameters often to the detriment of our extended possibilities. We do not realize what we are doing, we are made to realize what we should do; instead of why. Our interests are made in alignment with the interests of those producing the images. In some sense this is an incomplete book. It's a brave stab at what is going on, but it begs another, fuller look as to the relationship behind images, in part, because there is no critical framework. Choosing the right framework would further us greatly but as there is relatively no framework for assessing the multivalence of images, this book does not need one to do what it is doing."
Ways of Seeing,"An inspiring collection of essays about ways of seeing, or actually noticing what we see, when we look at images of reality (Like paintings or advertisements). A few of the essays are verbal; the others are visual (A collection of images. What do you see when you watch them?). With every answer these essays give, you find yourself with a few more new questions. Fascinating. Although this book was originally published in 1972, it is relevant and fresh even now. One essay, the third one, is about the role of men and women in art. Obviously a very delicate matter nowadays. No one would claim now that ‘men act and women appear’ (Page 47) because of the changing role of gender and because of new technical developments: Aren’t we all occupied with how we appear, since we started using Facebook and Instagram? I would have loved to know what John Berger and his team would have thought about that! A wonderful book for people who are interested in art or philosophy, let alone people who are interested in both, just like me. I’ll certainly look differently at art, advertising and social media, from now on!"
Ways of Seeing,"'The pursuit of individual happiness has been acknowledged as a universal right. Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless.' This book presents you with some really rare and interesting insights that will make you a lot to think about. It gives you evidence really good one that how society and media have influenced our psych. Its a great introduction for someone who is interested in arts and marketing. It gives you a lot of insights about the earlier time when media wasn't that influential with the current time, where media and advertising plays a very major role in defining art and artists. Berger talks about tradition and how it has influenced us, with also talking about the role of gender, how the art world has depicted both the sexes. This book really opens your eyes to different ways of seeing and many perspectives. I enjoyed reading this a lot, it will teach you a lot. Highly Recommended. Happy reading!"
Ways of Seeing,"I read this book in an AMTRAK train from the Bay Area to Portland. It was eye-opening :). Some of the essays are pictures only, pictures of paintings. The book is a little older, to me it portrays the spirit of its time, I enjoyed quite a few surprising moments. It definitely brightened my train ride through the night. All this Marxist vocab... As the title suggests, ""Ways of Seeing"" is about the ways we see. How our mind is formed through society and how this conditioning impacts on our perception and, well, what we see in the end. I became curious about this book, because, one, the cover is the picture of one of my favourite artists - Magritte. Second, a friend and I had wondered about why we view in the first place. I wanted nothing more than to share this book with him, but I don't know the reasons for why he did not see. So it is back sitting on my shelf. Come pick it up."
Ways of Seeing,"‘The meaning of the original work no longer lies in what it uniquely says but in what it uniquely is. How is its unique existence evaluated and defined in our present culture? It is defined as an object whose value depends upon its rarity. This value is affirmed and gauged by the price it fetches on the market. But because it is nevertheless ‘a work of art’ – and art is thought to be greater than commerce – its market price is said to be a reflection of its spiritual value. Yet the spiritual value of an object, as distinct from a message or an example, can only be explained in terms of magic or religion.’"
Ways of Seeing,"if you like this review, i now have website: www.michaelkamakana.com 281219: exactly the text i wish i had read as a young artist... also clarifies some reasons i do not like, for example much oil painting, not the ‘realist’, ‘representational’, that precedes 1900 and invention of cameras. the depiction of object, material, subject etc. is to me false, illusion, without presence, when it is what the painting is ‘of’ rather than what the painting ‘is’... i prefer abstraction, line, watercolors, graphics..."
Ways of Seeing,"This was quite an interesting read and very eye-opening with regards to how we perceive art. I especially appreciated the chapter that dealt with the way women are seen in society, with a heavy influence on European culture, and despite being written almost 30 years ago, I think it is still relevant today."
Ways of Seeing,"A compact book filled with fantastic, radical ideas. I couldn't help admire Berger's delineation of capitalism, proprietorship, publicity, the gaze on females amongst other things. It's a remarkable book to read."
Ways of Seeing,This book is hands down amazing.
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting vibey book about Sight. A real fun one in terms of both content and form. Every word is in bold EXCEPT the bolded ones!
Ways of Seeing,Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognizes before it can speek.
Ways of Seeing,"This is an amazing introduction on seeing and critical thinking. It has profound insights into sickness and emptiness of modern society. Berger reminds us to be conscious about what you are looking at and experiencing; He criticizes traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. ‘Ways of Seeing’ was originally a 1972 BBC TV series, which rapidly became regarded as one of the most influential art programs ever made. At the very start of the first episode, John Berger takes a scalpel to ; the blade’s rough abrasion on canvas. The painting Berger cut was a facsimile, but the metaphor of the scalpel is plain: to question is to dissect. It is to cut past the scrim of beauty, and reveal more fundamental anatomies: capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, mimetic desire, and so on. This opening of Ways of Seeing presents a filmic reenactment of the argument of Walter Benjamin’s essay ; which he wrote during the terrifying onrush of fascism. He saw the crisis of European liberalism as, in part, a result of the emergence of new media, like photography and phonograph. Other machines of replication, along with these, had produced a more disturbing change in social consciousness. He was also interested in the entire network of mass mediation and the new, seemingly unanchored art form of film. He believed a broader shift is happening leading to nothing less than ‘the shattering of tradition’ and the ‘liquidation of the value of tradition in the cultural heritage’. As new forms of technological culture replaced the old, civilization moved into a halfway house of mediation, susceptible to new modes of political adventurism and mass behaviour. Too bad, it only had four episodes. Carl Sagan’s amazing television series ‘Cosmos’ too had just 12 parts. Meanwhile, ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ has 250+ episodes. As I said, it talks about sickness and emptiness of modern society… Five star for the series. Part (, , , )"
Ways of Seeing,"oh WOW this was excellent my thesis supervisor told me to watch the show this book was based off of and i am so upset that i did not discover this until my 4th year of being in the art history program. if i were a prof teaching an intro to art history class this would be a very necessary assigned reading. one of the first assignments that they make you do is a visual analysis. what do you see? what is there? what could they mean? it's a little silly describing a portrait of a woman in a blue dress standing in front of a mirror but there's so much more to say. ways of seeing gives you THE fundamentals of looking at art and how to have a critical eye. though its nothing more than the basics, i think it starts off on a really good foot. like yes oil painting was for rich people and women are depicted through the violent male gaze but then you take a few more art history classes and write a few more papers and you continue learning about art history and then you step back and see that you know how to look at art and architecture! my roman history prof said that buildings were primary sources and that was so profound to me because yes! they are! i will always argue for the importance of art history because art is so important to humanity! they are products of the time and they reflect and respond to the time and the people. they're pretty! but also sometimes they're ugly! i mostly read this on the subway so it took me a lot longer to read and also because every sentence packs a punch and really makes you think about what they're saying. the book design is really pretty and cool but the bolded lettering makes it an eyesore and the paintings deserve to be in colour!!! so much is lost without the colour and shading! i would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys art - like this literally changed my life"
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting and I enjoyed - especially the essays about the portrayal of women in the nude in art + publicity + class. I like that the end of the book says 'to be continued by the reader'; I am curious to see how the contents of this book may have an impact on my perspective.
Ways of Seeing,"finally had a chance to finish this even though it was covered in my art history classes all throughout college.. I really enjoy the discussions and implications of class n status in these essays, and i appreciate berger’s accessible tone and writing. that’s not to say that the book wasn’t immensely eloquent and well though out. i learned a lot and even though people hate on the books design i had a fantastic time looking at the pictures as they are being discussed!! do that more in art books pleaseeeeee"
Ways of Seeing,"4/5 for pure content. 0.5/5 for format and print. Considering this is a book about art, you’d really think that the editors would have put greater consideration into the font and print. My eyes were boggling at the constant bolded text and monochromatic grainy images I could barely see. It really detracted from the book tbh"
Ways of Seeing,"completes my little looking-at-paintings trilogy of a month in siena, still life with oysters and lemon and now, ways of seeing. each of these books have been some of the most engaging nonfiction ive ever read n collectively have given me such a satisfying base to think about paintings in a way thats both historical and personally interpretive. i thought this was rlly accessible n still complex enough to give me room to connect it to things outside of the page. honestly this book feels so fundamental to so many of the film theory texts ive read in school that im surprised this wasnt assigned to me at some point. each essay is rlly strong individually but its amazing how berger allows them all to build off each other n make this book feel like one coherent work. i rlly enjoyed the insights about connecting the texture of oil paintings to a violent western ideology of possession and the ways in which colonial n sexist attitudes emerge from seemingly innocent still lifes of food and silverware. endlessly brilliant, makes me even more excited to look at art"
Ways of Seeing,"the critical deconstruction of western art practices (both old and modern) were interesting and well thought out, but what I liked the most is how it romanticized visual art in the very first essay. it gave me a better perspective of my own travel photography."
Ways of Seeing,every good book has a couple sentences so evidently true it's impossible to think outside of them once you accommodate them. john berger Never. Misses. A Fucking. Sentence.
Ways of Seeing,"So nice to read a book that talked critically and unpretentiously about oil painting, honestly. Has art always been just based on commission, capitalism, and property? ""The only places relatively free of publicity are the quarters of the very rich; their money is theirs to keep."""
Ways of Seeing,"“When in love, the sight of the beloved has a completeness which no words and no embrace can match: a completeness which only the act of making love can temporarily accommodate.”"
Ways of Seeing,Some essays better than others. Starts stronger than it finishes.
Ways of Seeing,"The 1970s and 1980s saw significant shifts in the ways we thought about art history, alongside its attempts to engage popular audiences. There were BBC TV shows in the 1970s that took art history outside the academy – for the traditionalist view there was Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation and others which espoused a conventional academic art historical view. Whereas Clark’s is seen as one of those shows that had lasting power and gravitas (which it did) the show that had the impact was John Berger’s in 1972. This is the book of that show. Unlike most books of art history, this is not a large format, lavishly illustrated in colour, glossy papered text, but a small paperback (glossy paper but with small black and white illustrations) and written in an accessible, engaging, pedagogic and didactic style that demands we think, rise to the challenge and answer the questions put to us. In this sense, Berger was part of the change in art history that saw the emergence of scholars such as Janet Wolff, Marcia Pointon, Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others who demanded that we understand art and art history as a social product, as a system of power and ideology with the result that pictures were not just pictures but social, cultural and political texts. In his version of this approach, Berger argues that the emergence of the canon of art as we know it and see it in the oil painting is linked to the emergence of capitalism and its peculiar deployment of power. He (and his unnamed co-authors – in the preface he says there are five authors) does this through seven essays, four written and three visual, exploring perspective and power (western art’s deployment of perspective places the viewer at the centre of the picture and valorises them, the nude, oil painting and advertising (which he calls publicity) while the visual essays argue for recognition of the place of high art in the popular present, for an understanding of power and dominance in the canon and claims to possession. When this book was published in 1972 this was a radical new way to think about old pictures on stuffy museum walls, and when I first read it in the early 1980s it remained provocative and challenging. It was with a sense of intrigue then that I came back to it 40 years after publication to consider whether it would be something I should set my students to read in an attempt to get them thinking differently about advertising. Although many of the ideas have become more mainstream, and although some of the writing has dated (for instance, it is gendered in ways we’d challenge now) the case retains its power and its pedagogic potential. It is humbling to find such a popularly accessible book that is both 40 years old and as powerful and important at is was when it first appeared. On its own terms it works, and we should not under-estimate its impact – but it will be intriguing to see what my students make of it. I am delighted to have revisited it."
Ways of Seeing,"Generally a delightful read, have yet to make notes on it. Update on 17 March: 3.5 out of 5 I first read this book on a 7-hour bus ride from Paris to Maastricht. I could feel a strong, burning gaze projecting from my left side the whole time. When the owner of that gaze, the Dutch girl that sat beside me, could no longer hold it in and asked me what was it about the book that made me seem so immersed in it, I really wanted point to the intangible conversation that started travelling between us and say, "", is exactly why."" I wasn't really reading. There was no way that one could absorb Berger throughout all that bumpiness. I merely acted like I was focused so that I didn't have to socialize. Other than my inability to enjoy normal socialization, I also couldn't quite aptly explain to her what's so mesmerizing about the book. Therefore, after 2 years, now that I'm working in an art organisation, I feel the urgent need to re-read this book. And there are only two things: 1. John Berger might be explaining things that you already know but just sit tight and sit through it because he'll explain it like you've never heard it before. The way he writes is sheer . 2. There's no better way of explaining Berger than by directly quoting him, for examples see below: The above is only the tip of the iceberg. As much as it fills my heart with wholesomeness as a pleasant read should, I believe this book is just what we all cite to make something that we wrote, which despite already making enough sense on its own, sounds better."
Ways of Seeing,"Ways of Seeing peels off the layers of difference between ""seeing"" and ""looking"" as it pertains to our perception of visual works of art. While looking is a natural phenomenon that happens through the interactions of our retinas with the outside world, seeing assumes an understanding, a context, a subject. Seeing, is an art in itself. Berger might just be one of the first people who situates ""seeing"" in this complicated setting for a wide audience. In the seven chapters of this book, Berger uncovers the social and political context of art as it has evolved through the last couple of centuries, drawing fascinating conclusions regarding the monetary value of art, its relation to our dreams, desires, bodies and class. I suspect some parts of this book, depending on the chapter and corresponding essays, are not particularly revolutionary to readers who are already familiar with said essays. For example, anyone who has read the renowned by Walter Bejamin, will not find the corresponding chapter in striking. But for others, Berger provides a thought-provoking and sensitive route. This is a wonderful book. The prose is both uncomplicated and compelling, beckoning the reader to keep reading. Berger has a gentle but keen style of writing and a sincere passion for art that radiates in-between the lines. There is a kindness, a caring, in his sensibility that I felt again and again as I read through, and yet, I can't fully describe what I mean by this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to understand what it means to ""see"" art, and I also recommend that you take advantage of the wonderful (perhaps also melancholic; read the book to understand what I mean by this) digital accessibility of the mentioned paintings and photographs to view them in a better quality while Berger discusses them."
Ways of Seeing,"really just the best of the best!!! a lot of feelings that I've had towards visual art, and oil paintings especially, since I was a little kid were realized and validated in this book (pat on the back Nils!!) feelings like how is art valued and why does this painting have a whole room while this other equally interesting painting is stacked on top of five others in that little dark museum corner or what's the point of museums in the first place, except for a place of exclusion and cleanly clipped foliage and high-priced coffee, when you can view a painting online or why is the way we talk about art so mystifying and frustrating and ultimately kind of a let-down or what is a nude, in an academic sense, compared to just being ""naked"" or how does art serve to perpetuate class divides and subserviency or why does this ad for Dior propped up against an article about Bush-era war crimes feel not only wrong but placeless? truly the most mind-shaking book on capitalism I've read in a while. a secretly subversive, evidence-based book that uses the aesthetic of academia to fuck academia, and any type of unhealthy obsession with aesthetic prioritization in the first place, over. really really rebellious stuff and i imagine it made a lot of people mad in the 70s. feels like, dare I say it, required reading for anyone going to a museum, googling, getting an ad on insta, etc. feels really true and ultimately makes visual art feel active for the first time in a forever. i actually feel like i finally have the tools to engage and critique! long live the proletariat!!!!"
Ways of Seeing,"Perhaps one of the all time must read small books ( less than 200 pages). Revisited for a reference and ended up rereading it . As fascinating as it is pioneering ( considering it was written in 1972, way back in capitalism's childhood, well before it grew up and cast it's powerful grip around the idea of human life). Berger and co essentially chart the history of visual imagery in art, from the era of oil painting to television, slowly peeling out layer after layer teasing out the implicit messages and societal subtexts hidden within the images, and quite remarkably without preaching a communist manifesto! Berger is still alive and kicking, I would be really curious to know his views on modern-age consumerism as a culture. It would be just wonderful if he takes time out to write a sequel - possibly commenting on the new era capitalism - from designer handbags to high definition televisions, perhaps not on the idea of compulsive consumerism as such ( which has been already covered here) but more on the consumers themselves as a cohort. The need for the consumerism and perhaps suggestions about alternatives?"
Ways of Seeing,"This has been on my list since forever, the TV show and the book, but I've done absolutely nothing about it other than think about it. And now I read it in two sittings (and one shitting, very sorry about the detail but it is true, I read a bit of this while pooping) and it was very good, clear, simple and captivating. It's something that I think about very often when exploring our world and all of its stories and pictures: why is it like this, who does it serve, what do we see and what do we actually see and what is the undertone and so forth. In a way I got muuuuuch more from ""Sinut on nähty"" by Anu Silfverberg than by this but then again this did exist a long time before that so I'm not putting them against each other but saying that they complimented each other in terms of the gaze. Maybe I'm just thinking about it because the part about the way women were painted had an impact on me and was way bigger than its length. I will proceed to watch the TV series as I am extremely interested in the gaze and to see better, in everyday life and while walking through this world and when watching films and reading books. There's always a WHY and usually its pretty disappointing."
Ways of Seeing,"A small collection of short essays on art. 4 writings and 3 full of images. I found the first 2 written articles more appealing - arguments quite clear and persuasive. Though only touching the surface of some issues, they are quite articulate and thus serve as a good introduction. I don't like the last written one on publicity(7th). The fifth is so so with not that good evidence. These last 2 seem too focused on the capitalist aspect of European culture. All the issues Berger discussed since then have been studied rigorously and when read now they are now no longer ground-breaking. Still, 40 years ago, Berger's book must have had a significant impact. It must be the nature of art, and well , but when some essays feature certain works and interpret them in some certain lights, I have to disagree."
Ways of Seeing,"Highly recommended read for anyone who likes visiting art museums. This is accessible, useful and concise. Finally, I thought, something written about appreciating art which isn't unnecessarily difficult to read. If I opened an art museum I might clip the best quotes of this and stick it underneath the gallery map to give people a basic starting point to use when looking at paintings. It is enough for anyone to understand, and encourages you to seek further developments so that next time you see a piece of art you might be able to understand why it is valued. I am unsure that I understood much in the wordless 'essays' other than the similarities that were between the paintings shown. Maybe no more was to be conveyed here. I wish the written essays could have went into more detail, but maybe that is just because I liked where they were going."
Ways of Seeing,"I'm an eye. A mechanical eye. I, the machine, show you a world the way only I can see it. I free myself for today and forever from human immobility. I'm in constant movement. I approach and pull away from objects. I creep under them. I move alongside a running horse's mouth. I fall and rise with the falling and rising bodies. This is I, the machine, manoeuvring in the chaotic movements, recording one movement after another in the most complex combinations. Freed from the boundaries of time and space, I coordinate any and all points of the universe, wherever I want them to be. My way leads towards the creation of a fresh perception of the world. Thus I explain in a new way the world unknown to you."
Ways of Seeing,"With all due respect to the good folks at Five Books who recommend this book for students of art history, (https://fivebooks.com/best-books/art-...) seriously, you are much better off to watch the You Tube videos of the BBC program on which this inadequate little paperback with its sad little B&W reproductions is based. Then you can see the paintings, and the way that Berger enlarges on his ideas by using the camera to zoom in on this and that. This is a link to the first one: You Tube will follow it with the rest of the series."
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting way to look at art and made me dig deep so with future rambles to art galleries I will be looking at it a little differently but still make my own summations on what the piece is trying to convey. I took a star off as the pictures are tiny and not a good representation of what the book is trying to convey while you cant see every picture clearly. I know it takes on different perspectives but the general picture should be clear and had to google some pictures to really see them. Overall a good addition to my library.
Ways of Seeing,"Read on kindle - formatting was awful (bold typeface and postage stamp sized images). Had the formatting been improved I would have taken much more from the pictorial essays. Still, a very interesting and eye opening read. Recommended,especially if you are interested in art history and how art intersects with societal underpinnings and expectations."
Ways of Seeing,"An absolute classic--a necessary read for all art history students, but more so for those who are not deeply ingrained in the field itself. Berger popularized and democratized his content, opening wider discussions about social context and the ""social history"" of art throughout several time periods and larger themes."
Ways of Seeing,"Many of his interpretations are quite misogynistic, especially when the woman is the focus of the work. I read this many years ago, and found his writings to be bland and incorrect. He also has a very good European centric view of artists of color. Blah..."
Ways of Seeing,Not ground breaking by any means but concise quoteable and intensely readable
Ways of Seeing,Everyone should read this book.
Ways of Seeing,"Short essays and lots of pictures. Quotable, but with a lot of meaningless wisery. I enjoyed the last chapter about advertisement the most, but as a whole, the book was meh."
Ways of Seeing,i hate pretentious men
Ways of Seeing,"The novelist and artist John Berger published Ways of Seeing as a supplement to a BBC documentary series about art history in 1972. It is a slim volume. Its ideas are weak, unoriginal, and poorly reasoned. It Is certainly a good book to ignore. Not one single chapter carries much intellectual weight. A prime example of Berger’s weak reasoning is in the section on the portrayal of nude women in art. Berger’s claim is that women in Renaissance paintings appear without clothing for the purpose of being enjoyed by aristocratic male viewers. As if that needed to be explained. The owner of each painting, presumably a male though it is hard to imagine that no women ever saw this stuff, owns the nude woman depicted the same way he owns property. Her nudity symbolizes his dominance and superiority over her. Her missing pubic hair symbolizes her lack of will in making sexual choices. While these claims may be true, Berger does not offer any explanation as to why we should accept his interpretation. John Berger says it is true so we must accept it as truth, case closed. By logical extension, this is like saying you own Jimi Hendrix’s corpse because you bought one of his records. Owning a painting of a woman is not equivalent to owning a woman. The painters hired women to model for them which entails the reality that those women could accept or reject the offer of hiring themselves out as models; this means they made choices. The painters themselves did not keep women chained up in dungeons. And Berger never takes up the idea that those women may actually have wanted and chosen to be portrayed in such ways. He does not cite one instance of a Renaissance woman saying anything whatsoever about her role as a painter’s model. So where does Berger get this idea from? He never tells. He also never cites any examples of what that time’s painters or aristocratic art patrons thought about these depictions of nude women either. Yet Berger claims to know exactly what they thought. Even worse, he writes as if all upper-class European men thought identical thoughts about women and he writes as though all women have identical thoughts about how women in paintings are portrayed. Common sense would tell you that opinions vary from person to person so overgeneralizing about whole populations of people who died long before he was born is absurd. Even if we accept his claim, which does appear to be plausible, why should be so concerned anyways? If the images are symbolic depictions, we do not have to automatically accept the content of the symbol as being legitimate. Each person can agree or disagree with the merits of what is symbolized as they choose. The ability and intent of the viewer to choose interpretations is never addressed either. John Berger’s stance as a male art critic in this matter is questionable too. He interprets these paintings on behalf of women without acknowledging whether or not he even consulted with women on the matter. How does he claim to be a representative and spokesperson for women? Isn’t he denying women a voice in this issue by claiming to be the arbiter of correct interpretations on their behalf? Isn’t that a form of male domination that he would otherwise decry? After all, he complains about women not having their own voice in Renaissance art so doesn’t this make him guilty of the same crime? The chapter on oil painting is no better. Rich Europeans buy paintings of objects because owning paintings of objects is the same as owning, or at least desiring to own, the object itself. Buying and owning a painting of a farm is the same as owning a farm. But how does ho know this? Research into how art owners of the time thought about ownership and art is nonexistent in Berger’s monologue. Why is this even raised as a problem? Are we supposed to accept at face value that purchasing and owning property is inherently wrong? Berger was a communist sympathizer so his answer would be “yes, owning property is inherently wrong”. But why should this idea be accepted? Just because he says so? If property is so terrible than why did John Berger sell his own paintings? Why did he have his books published by large corporate publishing firms to be sold as objects in a capitalist marketplace? Why did he choose to live in England instead of moving to the Soviet Union which was still communist in the 1970s? In the USSR, he would not have had the freedom to paint what he wanted to and he would not be allowed to publish books that criticize the political or economic system so maybe John Berger was being just a little bit of a hypocrite by hating the system he depended on for his own intellectual freedom. The final chapter is about the direct connection between oil painting and advertising. He does provide some insight into the psychology of advertising which makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and incomplete. Advertising provokes the consumer to desire products that make them feel part of an elite, like the Renaissance era aristocracy who owned the most property. No doubt, that appears to be more or less true. But again, so what? Why is it wrong to want to buy things? There do not appear to be many people in the world who do not want to have any possessions at all. But John Berger never examines the other side of the argument. His accusatory tone is manipulative and authoritarian; he wants to lay a heavy guilt trip on his audience and in the end, guilt trips are all about controlling people. Just read what Nietzsche and Foucault had to say about the Christian church’s use of guilt as a method of coercion and domination. Ways of Seeing presents us with sparsely worded text with weak reasoning and tiny black and white pictures meant to exemplify what he says. The claims lack intellectual rigor and the pictures are so difficult to see that this whole book comes off as a poorly executed work of juvenile nonsense. It is best to pass this one over. Its proper place is in the recycling bin."
Ways of Seeing,"“You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting 'Vanity,' thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for you own pleasure.” This was enlightening and a surprisingly quick read considering the depth of the topic. I thoroughly enjoyed the perspectives on women as objects in art, on oil paintings as a product and/or catalyst of capitalism, and on publicity (my Guy Debord read earlier this year came in handy here). My only point of criticism, and one I know has to do with the time this was written and published, is the air of finality with which the authors speak about the gender binary and the (mental) cages women are put/put themselves in. This would probably have been worded differently in a re-worked edition and maybe even extended to other genders and sexualities. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in art, sociology, or critique of capitalism."
Ways of Seeing,"I'm more of a fiction and narrative nonfiction person than a theory/critique one, and it feels important to mention that here. That said, this book still feels relevant af to the image-saturated world we live in, and I wish I'd read this way back in undergrad (honestly, I think it should be required reading for most undergrads)."
Ways of Seeing,"nothing revelatory here personally, but that is likely because i am reading it so relatively late in the game. if i had read this in high school it probably would be the greatest thing ever to me. does a wonderful job of condensing a lot of ideas circulating in critical theory into very accessible and compelling arguments. really a joy to read. impossible to overstate how good this is–sure you could just read benjamin instead, but where's the instant gratification in that?"
Ways of Seeing,An important book but outdated.
Ways of Seeing,"I suggest readers watch this video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4... rather than reading the book. The video series is highly informative than the actual book. Once you finish watching the series, make sure you visit the nearby museum to practically understand what is conveyed in the video. It would dramatically change your perspective of seeing things once you finish watching the series. Yesterday I have visited the folklore art museum and railway museum in our city. it was great to experience the practical points mentioned in the video which depict our shallow way of seeing things. I was able to understand more from the video series than from reading this book."
Ways of Seeing,I liked it. I think if I'd read it as an undergrad it would have blown my mind. Though I am sort of eh about how non-European art is used as a backdrop for the uniqueness - even unique in a negative way - of European art. The looking at women chapter is ✨ iconic ✨ but I think I liked the oil painting one the most.
Ways of Seeing,vv interesting & im sure ill return to this book in future
Ways of Seeing,"Engaging, enlightening and relevant, even 50 years later. The essay on post-Renaissance nudes was particularly compelling – would be curious to know how Berger's opinions on women x art (, media, publicity) might have changed in the 2000s. Off to watch the series!"
Ways of Seeing,"I 'read' this book many years ago, still return to it, and other Berger essays, from time to time for inspiration."
Ways of Seeing,Readathon #2 - Think this will require a re read when I'm less dazzled by the sun but I thought it was succinct and a great place to start for art criticism. Would have been 4 stars but this edition being in black and white made the images harder to appreciate.
Ways of Seeing,"A bit dense, but a really enjoyable and enlightening read, especially considering I know next to nothing about art history or art criticism."
Ways of Seeing,Read this for class but throughly enjoyed it 👌
Ways of Seeing,"In this series of essays, Berger makes a strong case by establishing the historical, social and political context of visuals (paintings to billboards) and thereby explaining the ""ways of seeing"" today. Broadly the essays can be divided into four categories - the relationship between what we see and what we perceive and how our pre-conceived notions about class, beauty, gender, society affect it, the presence of females (especially female nudes) in artwork and how it has evolved under the so-called ""male gaze"", the history of oil paintings and the many nuances of its proprietorship and lastly, the power of imagery and clever advertising as a tool to drive a consumerist society. There is also a video series of the same available on Youtube."
Ways of Seeing,Best core reading so far
Ways of Seeing,so true
Ways of Seeing,"By and large, I'm not a fan of manifestos. This one was no exception. It had a lot of insight, as manifestos often do, and I learned a lot from it, which is also not atypical. But to my mind, there's something insulting about a manifesto. To borrow a metaphor from Eudora Welty, writing like this is the equivalent of serving me my brain food already cut up for me. The ideas may be deeper than a trashy romance novel (for example), but the level of respect for the audience is roughly the same. And I always tend, right or wrong, to begin judging the ideology in question through the lens of that disrespect. If they have this much distrust for people in general, then how can their ideas about life not be tainted with that fundamental distrust? Since I do not share that distrust, how much am I really going to accept the ideas they've built on it? All of that is the case, as I said, with manifestos in general. So what about this particular one? the book, is apparently based on a BBC series of the same name and with the same purpose. Their purpose is to get us to look at art in a different way (namely, and being a leftist myself I don't throw this term around lightly: in a Marxist way). They begin with a very simplistic explanation of the importance of sight (based, apparently, on the fact that we are able to see before we are able to do just about anything else—never mind that we actually start using all four of our other senses before we even open our eyes), and then go on to the importance of visual art: painting, photography, that kind of thing. Then they leap straight into the Marxism and attempt to show the ways in which art, especially painting, has always been used to promote capitalism (even, it seems, before there was capitalism) and to celebrate the virtue of the propertied class. Some of which is interesting, actually, but some of which is stretching quite a bit. In true manifesto fashion, they make sure to consistently point out the ways in which seeming exceptions actually prove the rule. Also in true manifesto fashion, they are careful to pick the most egregious examples they can find in order to make their points without looking like they picked the most egregious examples available. I have to include one quote, because I think it's so emblematic. Or, to put it another way: ""We're rubber, you're glue. Bounces off us and sticks to you."" They're right about the nature of obsession, I'm sure, but that isn't much of a defence since their own argument could be described with that sentence. Here's the thing, though. There's a lot of value in the book. I actually do have a new way of seeing art now, and I think it's a better informed way. I also have a more complex understanding of some other issues, ranging from the nature of masculinity to the nature of history to the nature of envy and beyond. All of which is good, and all of which is despite the fact that this isn't my first exposure to many of these ideas. I got this book on a recommendation from a prof in grad school, and in his class and others I did think about & discuss many of these ideas. But the value of a manifesto, I suppose, is that (since they almost completely disregard opposing viewpoints) they can really succinctly get deep into the ideas at hand. So there is a lot to be gained from a book like this. Even if I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. P.S. I must say something about the design of this book. It's horrible. Really, absolutely terrible. Take a closer look at that cover image (click on it and look at the large version). The text on there is actually the beginning of the book. It's repeated again inside, but I guess they thought they'd look more serious and utilitarian if they just started right in with the cover? This book also suffers from the same ridiculous modernist notion (later completely disavowed by Jan Tschichold, who started it) that sans-serif fonts are better than serif fonts because they are free of the ""adornment"" of serifs. They take it one step further here, and use a bold sans-serif throughout the book. Which is just dumb. Many of their other design choices (full one-inch paragraph indentations, for example) are equally dumb, and the book looks like it was thrown together in half an hour by a high-school journalism class. Really, it's just atrocious. P.P.S. The book ends, and I'm not kidding, with a page that has one line on it: The absolute pretension at work here was almost more than I had the stomach for."
The Story of Art,"Reflecting on my reading year 2016, I came to think of books that have meant a lot to me over the past decades, and the first one that came to my mind was Gombrich’s excellent introduction to art history. I will have to go back twenty years, half my life, to the year 1996. I am twenty years old, and just about to discover the pleasurable adventure called university. For Christmas, I receive a much longed-for gift card to buy books that “will help me in my studies”, and I stand in a bookstore, one of those exquisite, inexhaustible bookstores on several floors that German university cities provide, and I am browsing through options. I probably spend hours there. I can still feel the time pass, while I look, think, go through history, art, literature. I pick a book, then another one, and more still, until I have to bring one back. Gift card value is weighed against all these lovely, lovely possibilities. At this moment in time, I own one Billy bookshelf, and it is not filled yet, as my children’s books and classics are left at my parents’ house. What do I pick? I don’t remember the fiction, but I do remember picking a “start of the term offer”, Mayersches Taschenlexikon, in 34 volumes, rarely used, as the internet takes over soon, and it is inconvenient to look up definitions by going through entries in alphabetical order. Some time between 1996 and now, it falls victim to one of our many moves between cities and countries. I don’t have it anymore. I bought it out of duty. I choose one extravaganza: Gombrich. A German hardback copy, beautifully illustrated, taking a huge chunk of the gift card money. I start reading as soon as I come home. And almost magically, it opens up the world of art to me. I learn why Egyptians “walk like Egyptians”, I discover Rubens, Bernini, Raphael, Leonardo, and Delacroix,and Canova, Manet and Monet, and Picasso, Duchamp and, and, and... I discover the world through a visual prism. Ever since then, Gombrich has followed my path. I soon come to read his more specialised works on form, function and symbolism in Renaissance art, I learn about his life, deeply influenced by 20th century history, and I keep going back to “The Story Of Art” whenever I need to take a step back and look at general ideas again. And I steal my mother’s Swedish copy! I want to read it aloud to my children, and they are only used to their father reading in German, and me in Swedish. So in order not to confuse them more than necessary in their Babylonian curse, I read it in Swedish, the stolen goods. And what a help that has been in the many museums around the world that my children have visited over the years. They recognise their “Gombrich” when they see it. Two years ago, my eldest son wants a copy - in English, in order to be able to quote from it. And of course I can’t resist buying it for him, at a shop inside the British Museum. So we have three copies, and I would not be beyond buying one in French, at a shop in the Louvre, maybe, just for the silliness of owning a favourite in so many different shapes. For they are all slightly different in layout, but equally satisfying visually and textually. I still recommend it to whoever wants a clear, concise, lovable account of the history starting with cave paintings in Lascaux, and moving forwards still, mirroring humanity in its need to express ideas, thoughts and feelings through the medium of art. My children and I will now be reading , which Gombrich wrote expressly for children, and YES - we read it in Swedish. And YES, we have it in English as well! And NO - one Billy bookshelf is not even enough for our children’s books anymore! This is The Story Of Lisa And The Story Of Art, to be continued..."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art, Ernst Hans Gombrich (1909 - 2001) The Story of Art, by E. H. Gombrich, is a survey of the history of art from ancient times to the modern era. First published in 1950 by Phaidon, the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the visual arts. The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. تاریخ نخستین خوانش (تورق): ماه سپتامبر سال 2001میلادی عنوان: تاریخ هنر؛ اثر: ارنست جان گامبریچ؛ مترجم: علی رامین؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر نی، 1379، در 674ص، مصور بخشی رنگی، نقشه، نمودار، شابک چاپ پنجم در سال 1387؛ 9789643124700؛ وازه نامه دارد، نمایه، کتابنامه از ص 639، تا ص 647؛ موضوع تاریخ هنر از نویسندگان اتریش - سده 20م فهرست مطالب: مقدمه (درباره ی هنر و هنرمندان)؛ یک- شگفتی‌های آغازین (آدمیان پیش از تاریخ و ابتدایی؛ آمریکای کهن)؛ دو- هنر در خدمت جاودانگی (مصر، بین‌النهرین، کرِت)؛ سه- بیداری بزرگ (یونان، سده های هفتم تا پنجم پیش از میلاد)؛ چهار- قلمرو زیبایی (یونان و جهان یونانی، سده ی چهارم پیش از میلاد تا سده ی اول پس از میلاد)؛ پنج- تسخیرکنندگان جهان (رومی‌ها، بوایی‌ها، یهودیان و مسیحیان، سده های اول تا چهارم میلادی)؛ شش- انشعاب بزرگ (روم و بیزانس، سده ی پنجم تا سیزدهم میلادی)؛ هفت- نگاهی به شرق (جهان اسلام و چین، سده ی دوم تا سیزدهم میلادی)؛ هشت- هنر غرب در بوته آزمایش (اروپا، سده های شش تا یازدهم میلادی)؛ نه- کلیسای مبارز (سده ی دوازدهم میلادی)؛ ده- کلیسای پیروز (سده ی سیزدهم میلادی)؛ یازده-درباریان و شهرنشینان (سده ی چهاردهم میلادی)؛ دوازده-تسخیر واقعیت (نیمه اول سده ی پانزدهم میلادی)؛ سیزده-سنت و نوآوری (نیمه دوم سده ی پانزدهم میلادی در ایتالیا)؛ چهارده-سنت و نوآوری (سده ی پانزدهم میلادی در شمال اروپا)؛ پانزده-اوج هماهنگی (توسکانی و رم، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ شانزده-نور و رنگ (ونیز و شمال ایتالیا، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ هفده-گسترش رنسانس در شمال آلپ (آلمان و هلند، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ هجده-بحران هنر (اروپا، دوره متاخر سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ نوزده-تنوع دیدگاه‌ها (اروپای کاتولیک، نیمه نخست سده ی هفدهم میلادی)؛ بیست-آینه طبیعت (هلند در سده ی هفدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و یک-قدرت و شکوه: قسمت اول (ایتالیا، نیمه دوم سده ی هفدهم و هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و دو-قدرت و شکوه: قسمت دوم (فرانسه، آلمان و اتریش، نیمه دوم سده ی هفدهم میلادی و نیمه اول سده ی هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و سه-عصر خِرَد (انگلستان و فرانسه در سده ی هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و چهار-گسست سنت (انگلستان، آمریکا و فرانسه، نیمه دوم سده ی هجدهم و نیمه اول سده ی نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و پنج-انقلاب پایدار (قرن نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و شش-در جستجوی معیارهای نوین (اواخر سده ی نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و هفت-هنر تجربی (نیمه نخست سده ی بیستم میلادی)؛ بیست و هشت-تاریخ بی‌انتها (پیروزی مدرنیسم)؛ توضیحات مترجم؛ واژه‌نامه؛ کتاب‌شناسی؛ نمودارها و نقشه‌ها؛ نمایه تاریخ هنر گامبریچ، یکی از آثار گرانبهائی است که درباره‌ ی هنر نگاشته شده؛ مدخلی برای ورود به دنیای هنر است، از نخستین تجربهٔ هنری انسان در نقش‌ پردازی داخل غارها گرفته، تا واپسین آثار هنری امروز جهان را، به خوانشگر عرضه میکند تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 30/08/1399هجری خورشدی؛ 30/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
The Story of Art,"This work is essential reading from a great expert in Art, with a capital A. Gombrich knows how to captivate his reader and explain concretely without getting lost in detail all the artistic evolutions over the centuries and render them in their context for an uninitiated readership. If you need only one book on the history of Art, it would be this one."
The Story of Art,"This book was perfect. For someone like myself who (now) has a little knowledge of Art (the capital letter here is deliberate) and some sense of history -- but who has big gaps and oceans of ignorance about the topic -- this book was perfect. It is mature, serious, to the point, absolutely free of jargon, sure, insightful -- always interesting, never pedantic -- and not eccentric in the least. Gombrich covers all the major artists and the movements they represent, and ties them together with clarity. Like one of our most knowledgeable 'friends' on the art circuit at goodreads, he is discerning, but not judgmental. Indeed, Gombrich's account of the development of modern art - up until World War II -- is fabulous, though brief. Gombrich is much less upbeat on more recent trends -- he mentions Pop, but quite deliberately (it seems) refuses to even mention Warhol's name. I know that it's very difficult for people who know a great deal about something to recommend -- or even read - introductory books. But for anyone looking for a book of this sort, this is definitely a winner."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art is a handy little survey of art history, primarily but not exclusively western art, from cave paintings and primitive sculptures to modern architecture and pop art. It is 500 pages of text and that many pages of well synchronized color plates in a smart pocket edition by Phaidon. Twenty-eight chapters, mostly quite brief, but each a skillful, thoughtful rippling of the surface, with hints of depth and well-defined currents moving quickly and sure footedly through the eras and advances and changing perspectives on art and the role of the artist. Gombrich is more than knowledgeable and yet manages to condense without condescending or reducing his narrative to trivial choices. He brings the freshness that comes with the enthusiasm of discovery. Of course, what he is sharing is not new to him, but sharing the works and his insights with the reader is new and exciting to him, and the enthusiasm is infectious. The intended audience is younger readers than myself, high school and college age readers or adults new to art history. But I found the book not just enjoyable but helpful and insightful. Gombrich’s prose is clear and crisp, and often charming. Traveling through this great span of time with him is like taking a walk through all the great museums of the world with an elegantly minded expert at your elbow."
The Story of Art,"Gombrich's Story of Art is a great survey (western-oriented however) of art for those who wish to know the big names and get familiar with some of the more common works. He covers all the various periods in a sufficient amount of detail without sounding pedantic or academic which is a challenge when explaining art history. I would just lament the lack of information about art in China, India,. S America and of course Africa, but that is kind of how Europeans have always viewed art, isn't it. It remains nonetheless a great starter for someone who wants to get their feet wet."
The Story of Art,"I should preface everything I say with a general caveat: I am a novice in the world of art, which is the reason I picked up this book in the first place. Although I often drew as a child, I was more interested in schematic, technical drawings than anything you could call ‘art’. And, despite my keen appreciation of music and fiction, I’ve always had the visual equivalent of a ‘tin ear’. I could stand in front of a masterpiece and be more interested in what I just ate for lunch. So with that shameful admission out of the way, on to the review. In a book such as this, there are bound to be almost as many people disappointed as impressed. It’s the curse of the writer of survey books: to reduce the scope of the material down to the size of one volume, enormous omissions are inevitable. If sales alone are the to be the rubric, then Gombrich must be considered a tremendous success; nevertheless, many whose favorite paintings and sculptures were passed over without mention or comment will likely be irked. (It should also be said that his treatment of ‘primitive’ art is hopelessly uninformed and, despite his best efforts, condescending. Additionally, this book hardly touches on non-European art.) Due to my general ignorance, I was none too bothered by this. In fact, it was just what the doctor ordered. Gombrich sweeps the reader through Western history, allowing just enough time for some quick rubber-necking at the sites along the way. What you get is a brief who’s who, and the general lay of the land. Of course, anyone with an even moderate interest in art history will have to fill in the quite sizable gaps left by this method, but that’s to be expected. The only book somewhat similar to I've read is by Ian MacDonald—a song-by-song analysis and critique of the Beatles’s music. That book (highly recommended) is astounding because MacDonald’s ears are so frighteningly acute. Although I have musical training and have been listening to the Beatles since my youth, MacDonald makes you hear their music in new and exciting ways, opening up a whole new aural world. Gombrich does the same thing, but to a lesser extent, with the history of art. He has a keen eye; and, more impressive, he is able to render technical analysis into the plainest of plain prose. The reader’s mind is not burdened by the slew of art history terms that are thrown at undergraduates in introductory classes. Gombrich bypasses the linguistic apparatus and goes straight to what’s really important: the image on the canvass (or the form on the marble, etc.). So, to bring this already-too-long review to a close, read for a clear, concise, and engaging introduction to the world of visual art. It’s not one-stop shopping. But then, what book is?"
The Story of Art,"Just a dozen or so pages into this book, I knew that it was one I wish I would have had access to when I was first seriously exposed to art. While in many respects, it is a conservative textbook (being first published in 1950), it is fundamentally meant for someone who has little to no previous formal contact with art history. Of course, if you have some, this can make you seriously engage some of your previously held assumptions about what you like and why you like it, but I got the distinct impression while reading that it was meant to initiate a teenager – a teenager who very much reminded of me of myself – into a whole new world. The inclusions and exclusions of certain artists are, of course, always arbitrary. However, Gombrich’s choices do not deviate too much from a standard art history text. What particularly drew me to the book was what I perceived to be its inordinate focus on medieval and especially Renaissance art. Of the twenty-eight chapters included in the book, about five mostly focus on Western medieval images (6 and 8-11). Another six chapters (13-18) focus on the art of the Western Renaissance. Most surveys of art history to which I had been previously exposed paid scant attention to medieval art and they sometimes did not give the Renaissance the space that I felt it deserved. There is no doubt the medieval and Renaissance art Gombrich’s pet periods here (and, admittedly, they’re mine, too.) What makes it so special is that, instead of spending the first chapter in an abstract exercise of thinking about what “Art” is, he forces you over and over again to take the art on its own terms. While discussing the various visual perspectives painted by the artist of “The Garden of Nebamun,” he says: “To us reliefs and wall-paintings provide an extraordinarily vivid picture of life as it was lived in Egypt thousands of years ago. And yet, looking at them for the first time, one may find them rather bewildering. The reason is that the Egyptian painters had a very different way from ours of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the different purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artists’ task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to them from any fortuitous angle” (p. 60). It is the occasional insight like this that makes the book most worthwhile for a neophyte. After all, how many of us have measured something we saw by the standards of our particular narrow time and place? He really drives home the point that thinking about art seriously means thinking about other perspectives (both literally and figuratively), other preoccupations, and other aesthetic modus operandi. This is a lesson that should be lost on none of us, about art, or about anything else."
The Story of Art,"The title of this book should be ""The Story of Western Art,"" because that is what 95% of this book is. Western Art. The ""Primitive Art,"" ""Looking Eastwards"" and ""Modernism"" section are an insult and should have been left out of the text along with his random snide comments. Othewise, this makes a nice commentary on Western Art. It's enthusiastic and reads like a ""story."""
The Story of Art,"I'm pretty torn about what rating to give this book. It is the o.g. primer on art history, so reading it gave me insight into the thought processes of some of my more old-school college professors. It also cleared up some of my shameful misconceptions around when certain artists were active (Titian 😳). The prose is very simple and engaging, and I looked forward to reading this book every day. However, I dread to imagine someone reading this in 2020 without a gargantuan grain of salt. Right off the bat, the book wildly speculates about the purposes of cave paintings (prehistoric people believed they were magic. obvs.). Any time it talks about non-Western art, the descriptions are pretty cringy. And female artists all but don't exist (I think the book names one). If there's a more contemporary art history book that is as thorough as this one, I'd love to hear about it."
The Story of Art,An excellent introduction to the history of European art. Accessible and great for building a narrative timeline.
The Story of Art,the sexual tension between this book being aggressively christian and the overuse of “gay” as an adjective 😫😩
The Story of Art,"Easy to read; makes you think of all the artists and the journey of ""Art"". English: https://elifthereader.com/books/the-s... Türkçe: https://kitaplikkedisi.com/kitaplar/s..."
The Story of Art,I’m speechless! This is one of the deepest theoretically histories of art I have read. I feel like I was walking naked in museum before reading it. Amazing book!!!
The Story of Art,"We can listen to music and appreciate it as art anytime and anywhere. I would like to be able to do the same thing with paintings. I would like to be able to look up a painting on my phone, and appreciate it anytime and anywhere. To most people, paintings are one dimensional, containing only what meets the eye. The reality of paintings is that they necessarily have enormous depth, ranging from the historical period during which they were created, what events lead to that point, the personal circumstances of the artist and the emotional and intellectual mental states of the artist during the act of painting. Paintings are snapshots of consciousness, and offer fertile ground for studying consciousness itself. I visited Rome and Florence in Italy in 2018 but failed to appreciate the grand artworks I saw there at the time. I hope I can appreciate these masterpieces more on my next visit. That being said, I did cry a little standing beneath David by Michelangelo. I didn't have the maturity to appreciate great art at the time, but David nevertheless evoked powerful emotions in me. In , Gombrich asserts that there are no wrong reasons for liking an art, but that there are wrong reasons for disliking an art. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this claim, but I think it's profound."
The Story of Art,"The story of art is also, in itself, a work of art."
The Story of Art,"I'd give it four stars if it actually discussed more than just one female artist :"")."
The Story of Art,"This is a thick and tremendously heavy book, but only physically heavy, and Gombrich is far from thick in his treatment of art down the ages. Read it lying face-down on the floor. Use it as a door-stop. The reproductions are exquisite in colour and detail, and of course it can be dipped into at leisure and as the mood takes. The Italian Renaissance is comprehensively covered. I wanted to buy this book several years ago but thought £25 was a bit steep, then found it last year on sale in Central London at half price and could no longer resist."
The Story of Art,"This well-composed book was a pleasure to read. And as far as introducing the history of art, it is exactly what I was looking for; beautiful photographs, lucid descriptions, no jargon, no pretension. I recommend that you read the short preface and first chapter, and I bet that you won’t stop there. The book’s 600 pages contain at least as many photographs, mostly of paintings, and about half of those figures are full-page (including a few fold-outs [ooh la la:]). The text is written simply – without jargon, footnotes, endnotes or appeal to authority. Mr. Gombrich’s restraint is impressive, since he obviously has a deep knowledge and personal appreciation for the topic. Instead of appealing to authority, he draws upon the art itself and universal human instincts to help the reader understand the artist and the art. For example, he explains the ancient Egyptian belief that images carry the soul, not by objectifying their primitive beliefs, but by suggesting an exercise by which the reader can discover that those feelings are commonplace within herself. He provokes (p. 40): “Suppose we take a picture of our favourite champion from today’s paper – would we enjoy taking a needle and poking out the eyes? Would we feel as indifferent about it as if we poked a hole anywhere else in the paper? I do not think so.” And so begins the dynamic struggle of emotion and reason that we follow through the history of art. This book impresses as much by its layout and editing as by the text and pictures themselves. Each of the many chapters begins with an architectural example. Since the text wisely refrains from tangents into cultural history, the architecture serves a second purpose (besides exemplifying preserved art) of adding practical context to the timeline. Then, each chapter ends with a small picture showing an artist from that time period at work. These little pictures are the only ones not actually referred to in the text, and again add non-text context, while bringing the reader closer to the artists. This approach succeeds in impressing the reader with the most important concepts in art history, since they are the ones that naturally recur throughout the story. The author frequently refers the reader to previous pictures (always giving the page number). Since the text is so brief, the reader, upon looking back at a previous picture, will also be reminded of the ideas expressed on that earlier page. Again, the author amplifies this learning effect by using consistent language and choosing pieces of art that will compliment each other. This model only breaks down in the final two chapters, which were added to later additions, about our contemporary art. The author has some worthwhile ideas about this topic, but writes too much. We can guess why this happened, and it does not detract much from the rest of the book. Finally, the backmatter contains a well-organized bibliography and timeline. As you can tell, I recommend this book. Even if, unlike myself, you already have a good knowledge of art history, I predict that you will appreciate this book. You may just read it a little faster."

Gombrich I was attracted to this beautiful little book in Waterstones; its wafer thin, smooth bible pages, section of over 400 rich colour plates and stylish, minimal cover design. I was also feeling a pang of guilt for not shopping in bookshops anymore because Amazon is so easy and cheap. Walking through a bookstore, perusing books and judging them by there covers, is a real pleasure and one we will be denied access to as everybody shops online, I am pretty sure we will see high street bookshops closing down soon unless they can figure out a way to compete with Amazon. So I bought The Storey of Art mainly because it’s so attractive but I also have a staggering lack of knowledge about art history - this looked like a good way to fill myself in. I read a quote recently that said if you read one hundred books on a subject you can call yourself an expert, it’s a bit daft but I have decided set myself a challenge; read 100 art books. This one has taken me about three months to read so expertise feels like a distant dream. It took so long beacuse I wanted to concentrate and take it all in, this book covers the whole of art history from early cave painting to post-modernism, that’s a lot of useful information, also, it’s not just reading the words but taking the time to look carefully at each image and it’s not the sort of book you can read in the bath or in bed because you have to keep refering back to plates. Fortunatley it is extremely accesable, intriguiging and keenly observing making it very readable and a little pleasure to indulge in. Being so ignorant of the subject, I loved that it took its time over periods and themes, referring back to them in the following chapters, revisiting artists and styles and giving in depth critical background to works such as stylistic influences and pressures on artists of different times. It strikes a perfect balence of being informative and comprehensive without becoming stifling; it is an insightful and rich overview. I am certain that I will actually be able to remember some of this information, I couldn’t have hoped for more from art book #1/100. So maybe walking into bookshops and judging books by their covers is a good strategy after all."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art is an incredible book, but a total sausage fest. I'm giving it 5 stars, because it narrates the history of art in an engaging, digestible, colourful, and conversational manner in a way that brings the subject matter to life for a wide audience. I was riveted, absorbed, inspired, and left with a thirst to go out into the world and learn even more about art. That doesn't mean that I believe this is a perfect book. It looks at art from a Eurocentric perspective, only discusses ONE female artist (zero in the First Edition), and retains some phrasing that will seem culturally insensitive to the modern ear. Still, this book gave me a whole new appreciation for art. Not ALL art, I hasten to add. I remain unmoved by a lot of what Modern Art has to offer, and there are only so many renditions of ""Madonna with Child"" that one can view in an afternoon before they all start to blur together. But art appreciation is certainly a skill that can be developed with increased knowledge of intent, context, purpose, and technique. Now to read The Story of Art without men..."
The Story of Art,"🖼️ 👩‍🎨 🎨 What a wonderful story, the human desire to make images of what we see and what matters to us, a desire there from the very beginnings of the human race. It’s a pity some groups, often enough religious groups, eschew representational art, or art of any kind, because in the past some of the most amazing art 🖼️ had religious themes and was created by religious persons. Or, shall we say, artists in connection with faith and spirituality. There are still some of those, but in my time I’ve heard creative art and creative writing disparaged far more than it was praised in religious circles."
The Story of Art,"This book is the best story of art ever told. I devoured the book years ago, when studying at the Art Academy. for those who are not into art, or think they are not interested in art..it will make you love it! and it will teach you from the very beginning how to see ""the mind"" of the artist in the creation.. highly recommended"
The Story of Art,"I thumbed through a much older (perhaps first) edition of this book when I was away from home and looking for something to read. I was immediately hooked by Gombrich's enthusiastic writing. When I returned home, I was extremely pleased to find that the latest edition was lavishly illustrated and updated to reflect more recent times. In my opinion, the book is fabulously readable for two reasons: Every piece of art mentioned is shown in the book beside the text and the author avoids ""pretentious jargon"". I wish every art book followed just these two principles. While the European art from the Thirteenth to Nineteenth Centuries (the bulk of the book) eventually became a slog which threatened to make my eyes glaze over, this is no fault of Gombrich. Instead, he has given me a much greater appreciation of this time period. The art is so much more interesting against a backdrop of history and biography. True to the title, the book really does read like a story. It's not just a series of mind-numbing names, place, and dates. It's a seamless narrative of art over time. So while I'm sure it was very difficult to write, the whole thing feels effortless."
The Story of Art,"It would be no exaggeration to say that this book changed my life. Before I read this I thought that most art was overpriced garbage. Especially modern art. By going through the history of art and saying how one era shaped the next and also why art is important to human development really helped me to 'get' art. Since reading this book I have taken up painting myself as well as regularly going to art galleries and museums. Having said all this, the book can be a bit dry sometimes and you can feel like you are wading through sections. If you want a book that explains art and art history then go no further."
The Story of Art,"A great book for learning and understanding art. This book was interesting to me because I worked for a time at an art gallery. I learned a lot then about art appreciation, and learned more from this book. The text is very readable and the pictures are beautiful. Great coffee table book =)"
The Story of Art,"It is one of the amazing books I have ever read. It is really comprehensive, I wish it was longer and full of more details."
The Story of Art,"This book is an essential. A book that can't miss on any shelf of an art historian, an architect or designer, and in general anyone interested, lover or influenced by Art. The Story of Art is an ambitious book, which traces the history of mankind with its artistic development, whether painting, sculpture or other plastic forms. It's a reference book rather than a reading one but it's a jewel that must have nearer you. Spanish version: Éste libro es un esencial. Un libro que no puede faltar en ninguna de las estanterías de un historiador del arte, un arquitecto o diseñador, en general, cualquier persona interesada o influenciada por el arte. La Historia del Arte es un libro ambicioso, que recorre la historia de la humanidad junto a su desarrollo artístico, ya sea pintura, escultura u otras formas plásticas. Es un libro de consulta más que de lectura pero que debes tener cerca."
The Story of Art,"For a few semesters, art history was my minor in university. I did not know a lot about art, but I was interested and it seemed fun. If only my courses were as good as this, I would not have given up on this field of study. Without being condescending or snobby (my main problem with my former teachers and some fellow students), Gombrich writes about art history in a way, that is very exciting and fascinating for the uneducated reader (i.e. me). The art prints in my edition are extremely beautiful. Definitely recommended."
The Story of Art,"Probably the best introductory text for art history and art theory that exists. Originally published in 1950, but subsequent editions (it's up to the 16th now) have been broadened to include key modern artists, works, and ideas. Clearly written and explained in Gombrich's no-nonsense style. It does stick largely to the Western art history canon, but for an introduction to the subject, it's a go-to."
The Story of Art,"It a decent introduction to art history but skips past so many greatest, especially women. Very male centric. Does talk about other places out of Europe but puts too much focus on connecting to European art instead of letting it stand as its own art. Pretty decent for beginners but far from perfect for scholars."
The Story of Art,No woman mentioned in this book. Trash
The Story of Art,"The Story Of Art A good book to pair with this reading might be - Key Moments In Art, Lee Cheshire Gombrich surveys the history of art through the ages, incorporating the successive opinions, tastes, and works of art into one continuous story. His style of writing is easy and unassuming, assisted with many beautiful illustrations of paintings, sculptures, pottery, cave art, frescoes, and icons. From the ancient era to the modern era, Gombrich explains the current theories behind why and how early humans - hunters and gatherers - drew on the walls of the caves nearby their settlement, or crafted figurines and masks. The book is considered a seminal piece of work for any aspiring art student, and as such would serve as essential reading for anyone starting a journey in the realm of understanding works of art. As a starting point, Gombrich argues that our perception of art, and consequently our love for it, is often strangled by what we see from our own vision - haemorrhaged by our constant desire for all things realistic-looking. Rather, he argues, we should be asking of a piece, ""does it work?"" in the way the artist intended. He digs down on the ancient Egyptian era of art and investigates the hieroglyphs that proliferated the walls and tombs. What we at first may see as simple, two-dimensional and amateurish pictures, is really an indication of the artist's purpose. They saw hard-grafted stories and laws of their religion, alongside a set of beliefs, being followed. One example is that an Egyptian artist was known as ""he who keeps alive"", and as part of the tomb etchings an Egyptian would draw every part of the person in likeness, as they believed that would transfer into the afterlife - any such missing limb or foot from the hieroglyph is then assumed also to transfer into the afterlife - and so it became necessary that such bodies were contorted to preserve likeness of the soul. It was an old and tried tradition until Akhenaten, a pharaoh in the New Dynasty, tried to usurp and upset this stern style as it was a change from the multiple gods to one god and the sun rays, but by Tutankhamun's time Egyptian art reverted to its time-old tradition for a thousand more years. Art was thus at this point a form of function, rather than for pleasure. The Minoans and Myceneans shared in the Egyptian art until around 400BC, when Greek art became its own character. Eventually, the Greeks challenged the usual convention of styles and began with a technique called foreshortening on pottery showing their own mythological stories, when a hidden or shortened feature of a foot or arm of the body is still concealed in the picture. This was a striking and deliberate separation from the Egyptian understanding: where the Egyptians used their knowledge, the Greeks used their eyes. He also asserts that an art ""style"" is particularly hard to define except with when it is confined to certain laws, such as the law of perspective and law of diminution of distant objects. It is with the Hellenistic era of Greece and the Empire from Alexander the Great that art develops and becomes its own. No more were works of art done for tribal magic, religion worship, or myths. They start experimenting with capturing the expressions in faces, the idea of harmonised beauty in sculpturing the likeness of human bodies, and studying the fierce emotions and movements of the body - muscle, sinew, and bone all expressed in the marble. Dramatic scenes, such as from the sculpture Laocoon by Alegsander and Polydorus, show exquisite detail and is an exemplar of the ""Greek baroque"" style of the time. With the success of Alexander across the Hellenistic Empire, that skillset was shared across the known world. Where before, rigidity prevented artists to foreshorten, now limbs were being hidden and feet were shown in portrait, which to us would seem ludicrously plain but to them it was a huge step out of the normal circle, as before, it was a step into art for its own sake. It was also from this period that the wealthy and aristocratic class began to collect works of art for pleasure, or to have works of art copied, and privately owned. It demonstrates a markedly different perception of art, from the ancient Greece of Praxiteles to the Hellenistic Greece of Alexander. After Greece it was Rome, where Rome had at first imitated Grecian statues but advanced in civil engineering feats from inspiration. In likeness to Greek columns, the Romans implemented a heirarchy of classical arches from the construction of the wedge-shaped stones. This feat established a newly spectacular form of engineering, known as vaulted roof and dome constructions. Rome had become the epicentre of civil art and its aqueducts, colosseum, roman baths, roman roads, and roman arches and domes. ""Art"" had an unusual military connotation with the Roman Empire, with military strategies, tactics, training, and strength being as though a form of pleasure in the mind and body. The Dark Ages of the Early Middle Era, he explains, is typically referred to the time when the Roman Empire fell, and therefore is listed between AD500-1000, with the High Middle Era of the medieval period thereafter between AD1000-1400, until the Age of Discovery brought the Renaissance to light. This, he does, to then talk through the various movements and styles that emerged in these Ages. As such, Gombrich details the Gothic art movement emerging from the 11th Century - or also known as Norman art - and was dispersed across the world up to the 14th Century. It appeared to convey a sense of commanding power, sturdiness, steadfastness in its buildings with hard symmetrical geometric shapes, stained high-glass windows, as well as implementing traceries and pointed arches that reminisce Roman triumphant arches. During this period, painters began to express their work as a means of capturing the important message of the gospels or of Christ. Suddenly, we start seeing dynamic movements and stories squashed in one fresco, entablature, or sculpture; we see emphases on interest being from telling a sacred story to showing nature in its likeness - people being painted in likeness being an alien technique at this time. Giotto was given by Gombrich as a first-class example, who helped to catapult the arguably slacking Italian painters and sculptors into a new paradigm of work of art, who were taking influence from Byzantine art. Then come the Renaissance period of 15th-16th Centuries, split between Early- and High-Renaissance, meaning rebirth and rediscovering that art which the ancient Romans were involved with. This was the period of extraordinary gift from Donatello, Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Uccello, Francesca, Verrochio, and more. Sfumato was the new technique, an innovation of Da Vinci, that had the paintwork melting and mellowing the outlines within features of the flesh to create a naturally-flowing element, and became popular when noticed from the Mona Lisa painting. It was, however, in the merchant city of Florence where this new innovation was most intensely felt. Baroque art, the succeeding movement to the Renaissance between the 17-18th Centuries, cultivated a strong sense of ""grotesque"" or ""absurd"" techniques and visual details that had artists break away from the traditional classical and ancient Greco-Roman themes and forms. Gombrich brings the specific elements of Baroque art - the elegance, far-reaching, story-driven, emotionally-gripping, emphasis - to life by highlighting Caravaggio's work, Doubting Thomas. Baroque art is characterised by the play on light and shadow, supposedly also as a symbolic gesture of good and bad, and Caravaggio's Doubting Thomas provides a spectacular introductory spectacle of real provocation in both thought and action. Gombrich argues, and I also believe, that Caravaggio must have read the Bible again and again most vigorously to feel the essence of the spookiness, the dark macabre compared with the light salvation reality of the event, the position and posture of the scene as one looks-on as though witnessing it as one of the disciples, the shock of the protagonists, the truly grotesque nature of thrusting the finger in the side and feeling the fleshiness inside, as a point of call to faith. It was a step to exhibiting truth and sincerity, rather than harmony and beauty. All of these should incite a burst of emotion, reacting to the realness, that counteracted the Renaissance ideals of harmony and beauty of the Biblical events. As a point of understanding, Biblical works acted as more than just for the pleasure: they were situated or painted on altars, pews, on murals, on ceilings of churches, as frescoes or triglyphs; Madonnas and the Christ child were sculpted, the Nativity scene, and the Cross, all for new - and old - Christians to understand the stories in an interpreted and illustrated view rather than depending solely on the text, where failure to understand context and cross-reference might prove hard. Pope Gregory the Great once said, at the end of the sixth Century, ""Painting can do for the illiterate what writing does for those who can read"", and was instrumental in helping those against these daring portrayals of sacred beings to understand the benefits, and this line of thinking was prevalent up until the Reformation period of the 16th Century. During the time of the 1600s and 1700s, artists were experimenting with how to perfect techniques of their skills, some wanting to break away from the academic art seen as inadvertently haemorrhaging the freedom of artists to breakaway from perceived rules and laws of Art. Artists, on one hand, may have been delighted with the shift from depending on patrons who would often interfere with their intended works of art, bully them into adding or removing a detail. In saying this, however, what they delighted in losing, they dreaded in gaining another, more tyrannical ruler in nature - that is to say, the buying public, the bourgeois, the acquired taste. The common marketplace and public events were now the place aspiring artists had to go to sell their pieces, or depend on art and picture dealers. Competition now was very stiff. Competition was in fact so very stiff, that by the late 1800s a certain triumvirate of leading original artists - unbeknownst to themselves - would permanently change the world in its understanding of perceiving works of art. These artists would suffer in isolation, and endure condemnation, from the viewing public, and would never see or sniff an ounce of the successes their works would bring, that bore out of feelings of dissatisfaction with the production of art at the time, in particular to academic art. This dissatisfaction then propagated a vast array of new movements, immediately grasping attention to both public and student artist, and grew out new ideals and ways of conveying ideas on canvas. It began the era of what we now know as ""modern art"". These leaders of art, this triumvirate, was Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, and Paul Gauguin. From Van Gogh and his wholesomely bold impasto-style oil paintings provoking his own senses excitement and radically contrasting colours, Expressionism was born; from Cezanne and his determination to bridge the impressionist-style with his experimental use of small brushstrokes to form big fields of intensely bright colours, developing a craving for studying light and direct observation of landscapes, creating a collection of airy paintings, came Cubism; from Gauguin came the influence of the cloisonnist-style known as flat-faced painting, when paintings are void of particular light and shadow, and therefore it paved the way for Primitivism, a mode for recreating the aesthetic appeal of ancient antiquity paintings. One interesting point Gombrich had argued was that there is no such thing as ""Art"", in the sense of snobbery and pretentiousness that comes with an arrogant view of ""Art"", from an observer repeating fancy-sounding terminology and jargon in a museum whilst looking at a Boticelli or Van Eyck, but rather of works of art - where an artist suffers to translate their ideas on to canvas or marble until it is right to them - where we appreciate the mood and relationship between artist and canvas, irrespective of whether we like it or not: that it is rather more profitable to explore each painting in silence and understand it, than to half-know the art but act like you do. We may also be pleasantly surprised, he continues, that we might even prefer the scruffiness of a study sketch rather than a complete picture - and compares Albrecht Durer's painting of a rabbit, to Rembrandt's study of an elephant. The uncertain - perhaps somewhat ugly - scruffiness of the sketch, the excited free-flowing drawn lines capture the eye and it fills in the rest. These artists work to the point of perfection, when no other could add or change it to improve upon it. Overall, this book was a fantastic and easy read, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the works of art that have been produced throughout the ages, as one never finishes being a student of art. It is a story of the ages as told by its art and artists, favoured with extraordinary gift of persuasion and attention to detail, balancing shapes with colours and an imagination translated to canvas. His careful study of the illustrations and ensuring the reader understands his mind, the artists' mind, and what we should hopefully experience from the paintings is reassuring and humble."
The Story of Art,"I DID. I’VE FINISHED IT. Ok so it was very, very, VERY interesting. I’ve learned so much and have a now a very global comprehension of the art’s development throughout history. It’s well written and very easy to read. It’s quite a long book but it covers most of the basics in one read so it’s very much worth it. Would totally recommend"
The Story of Art,"I bought The Story of Art while about to leave Brugge, after a long week-end that was supremely friendly and quite artsy. I started reading this book as soon as I sat down in the train and was enchanted by it until the last page. 's is a masterful story of the main works and styles of art, from 30,000 BC until the 20th century. (The 16th edition includes material from up to around the late 1980s, in terms of art critique, and early 1970s, in terms of artworks.) The book is written from a Western (British) perspective but with enough mentions about Asian and African artworks to make the story global. The types of art covered here are chiefly architecture, picture, and sculpture. There are many things that I liked about this book, from its crisp analysis of artworks to the excellent rhetoric, the latter always in favor of art. The story covers mostly cave painting, ancient art, Greek and Hellenistic art, Roman and Byzantine art, Romanesque and Gothic art, Renaissance and Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo, Romanticism, and Modernism and Post-Modernism. Each style is illustrated with a selection of artworks, many of which are well-known to art beginners such as myself, all of which are discussed not only in terms of craft by also with regard to impact to the age and future art. The first artwork is usually an example of architecture, which is analyzed as a framing reference for smaller artifacts. Artworks from different ages and styles, but depicting similar topics, are compared tetually; I found very useful the detailed comparison references (e.g., ""examples of miniatures as page 211, figure 140, and page 274, figure 177""). There are numerous references to the actual quality of an artwork, which should create a very different impression from the in-book illustration; the book includes often details of the presented works, so that the reader is more easily able to understand its main characteristics. The book concludes with an analysis of art's future. I liked very much the warning that, in the 20th(-21st?) century, a real danger to art is the expectation of non-conformism---Gombrich mentions the ""tradition of the new"" of Harold Rosenberg. The book concludes with a number of additions to the 1950's first edition, and a set of useful editorial tools: an index of terms and works of art, a section of commented related work, a graphical representation of the periods and works of art covered in the main text. Among the main attractions of this book is it's deep yet understandable text. For example, I felt I could really understand the point raised by Gombrich in this paragraph: Among the things I would have liked to see improved in the book, perhaps the main element is the lack of discussion about other forms of art, from literary to performing art, from movies to computer gaming. Another rather negative point is the minimal coverage of Asian and African art, with only scant information and only some late inclusion the 20th century discovery of Greek, Chinese (Terra-Cotta Soldiers), and other artworks. I would have also been happy to see Gombrich's work continued, so that this 16th edition can take a more balanced look at Modernist and Post-Modernist art. One of the elements that turned out to be mostly negative was the detail with which the Modern and Post-Modern periods are covered. In the words of the author: Perhaps the memory of the by-stander, that is, the tendency to observe in more detail current rather than old events, motivates this over-description of material in these sections. Overall, a wonderful read for any art lover."
The Story of Art,"I decided to reread this after a twelve year gap to see if I would still be stuck with awe and wonder as I was the first time. The answer is yes. To encapsulate ""the story of art"" into one single book is an impossible task, so think of this book as ""a story of art"" written by a white man in the 1950's. He is an incredible knowledgeable and passionate man though, who is a wonderful guide for where to begin in the vast and often intimidating world of Art. Now that I have a tiny bit of footing into the art world, I enjoyed this book more, but was also increasingly acutely aware of the pitfalls of this and other such art- history books that cover large periods of time(in this case from the earliest cave art to the present day.) Having said that, what this book accomplishes is no small feat. Its no wonder this is considered such a classic. The biggest strength of this book is its use simple language, which is actually harder to do than it seems. Its easy to hide behind fancy rhetoric that often obfuscates rather than illuminates. Not a word is wasted and it all makes the most marvelous sense. Its other strength is that it does not mention any artwork in the text that it does not show in the book so the text never degenerates into a list of names that would mean nothing to one who is unacquainted with the work in question. This also leads to a very rigorous selection of artwork without crowding the book with the authors own favorites at the risk of excluding overused and familiar artworks. He states ""..it is meant for those who look for bearing in a new field, and for them the familiar appearance of apparently 'hackneyed' examples may serve as welcome landmarks."" Where it truly shines is that The story of Art teaches you how to look at art. Its like teaching a man to fish. For example, if you've ever looked at medieval art and dismissed it as crude, awkward and badly done this book will give you a pair of fresh eyes. Why was this art was being made? By whom? for whom? And to what end? These people knew how to draw(most of the time, looking at you Bayeux tapestry), but it wasn't important to the artist as long as all the symbols that were needed to get the message across were present. The idea was to communicate a message effectively and these paintings do that exceedingly well. He explains the idea through Egyptian art which we may dismiss as flat and 2-D but it was the symbolism and message of the art that mattered, there was no room for confusion. Everything had to be represented in its most characteristic angle, so the face in profile, the eye from straight ahead, as was the torso, and the limbs sideways again as they are best seen. These strict rules were followed by all Egyptian artists, they couldn't leave anything out, perhaps for magical purposes? You learn to look at art through the intentions of the artist which were often shaped by the period of history they inhabited. Because Art and Architecture are inextricably linked together there is a section in each chapter on the architectural developments of various periods which, though very brief, does round off the picture of the period really well as well as providing a great jumping off point for further inquiry. After all, most of this amazing painting and sculpture was made to be housed in actual buildings right? Also, it shows you how the ancient traditions in architecture have trickled down into modern times, there might be a piece of ancient Greek building tradition in your town! A second reading after a long gap is a richer and more enjoyable experience as I can now disagree with many of the opinions stated(oh the joys of being contrarian) since I have been exposed to alternate histories and interpretations. For example, did Titian really die of the plague at 99? apparently not. Is Giorgione's ""the tempest "" most likely just based on a Greek myth or was it more of a comment on society. Who knows, its all quite mysterious. In conclusion, anyone who has even a slight inkling towards the world of art and is looking for an accessible introduction will definitely find value in this book."
The Story of Art,"Beautiful prose and comparison of a wide variety of art movements and styles. It really does address the inter connectedness of art and how the desire to solve problems regarding light, form, depth, and emotion lead to certain movements. This book is broad in scope but a great starting reference!"
The Story of Art,"This was the great standard history of art in my school years, immensely readable, but at the time and since I have never really liked histories of such comprehensiveness. You can not write, or read, intelligently on all types of art, in all periods, all over the world with the same degree of appreciation or interest. Gombtrich's history is of course very Euro-centric and very old fashioned, in today's terms, in what is considered the 'important' areas in the history of art. But what he does write about is written intelligently and well. I am in two minds about this book, I don't really care of universal histories but if you are going to buy one then this is not bad, but how it would fare as text book today is impossible for me to say. If it gets someone in reading more, and exploring more art, of any type then it has done its job."
The Story of Art,"This was a very useful and comprehensive overview of the history of art, starting in prehistoric times and ending in the twentieth century. It is divided into 28 chapters, each which explains in detail a movement or period in art history. He covers most of the Big Names, although sometimes it feels as though he is trying to squeeze everything in. My main complaints are that it is very Western-centred and feels a little dated, and only includes ONE female artist, which feels like a massive oversight, particularly as he doesn’t even address the lack of female artists. Despite this, it’s a great book and really helped me to educate myself on a broad range of artists, periods and movements. Although it’s slightly dated, it remains a classic."
The Story of Art,"before the reveiw, a little pretext, i love art history, NPR and David Sedaris, so the fact the i read this book basically cover to cover isn't too surprising. it was clear and consise and had so many pictures (faomous and obsecure) i must have read the chapter on impressionism and post impressionism 40 times and the section and mannerism at least half that. but if your not interested, this won't read like fiction, or any kind of even remotely intersting text. to some its like reading the dictonary, but for me it was really great."
The Story of Art,"I kept expecting this book to bog down and get boring and it never did, even when it got into modern art (which I now feel like I have a better grasp of). Gombrich isn't just an art historian,he's like a psychologist, I felt like I had a better understanding of why people were making all this funky contemporary art; even if I still don't necessary like or understand it, at least I kind of feel I see where it's coming from. Really a great book if you want a basic intro to the history of art."
The Story of Art,"The classic introduction to 'Western' art, beginning with its classical origins in ancient Egypt, and casting light on the social, economic, political, cultural and technological influences from which it arose in each time and place I was fascinated from the start, and a relatively considerable proportion of Gombrich's wisdom has stayed with me. Naturally the presumption to offer a monolithic story of art is absurd - but this particular story is well worth sharing."
The Story of Art,"This is the most complete book about The History of Art. It talks about all kinds of artistic expressions and it's organized by period of time. It contains a lot of pictures of famous paintings, sculptures, buildings, of anything related to art. It was the first book I bought when I entered architecture graduation college. It helped me a lot."
The Story of Art,"Gombrich provides a comprehensive history of art from early primitive works to the end of the second world war. This book provides an overview to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for art by understanding how it has developed throughout human history. He eloquently describes works created by the great masters in a loving and cherished diction, providing a soothing and pleasurable read. There are certain periods of art history that I do not find as interesting, which caused certain chapters of books to be slower reads. That being said, the book does a great job of achieving its purpose: to provide a high level overview of the entirety of Art History for the lay reader. The book can best be summarized by Gombrich's introduction, ""People who have acquired some knowledge of art history are sometimes in danger of falling into a similar trap.. When they see a work of art they do not stay to look at it, but rather search their memory for the appropriate label. They may have heard that Rembrandt was famous for his - which is the Italian technical term for light and shade - so they nod wisely when they see a Rembrandt, mumble 'wonderful ' and wander on to the next picture. I want to be quite frank about this danger of half-knowledge and snobbery, for we are all apt to succumb to such temptations, and a book like this could increase them. I should like to help open eyes, not loosen tongues. To talk cleverly about art is not very difficult, because the words critics use have been employed in so many different contexts that they have lost all precision. But to look at a picture with fresh eyes and to venture on a voyage of discovery into it is far more difficult but also much more a rewarding task. There is no telling what one might bring home from such a journey."" (18)"
The Story of Art,"this is an example of me saying i started a book when i really didn’t, i actually read this book pretty much in the last three days as PRE pre reading (a lot of the books you’re gonna see on here from now on will be art history related) a very good introduction to art history, it is written in a clear and often almost comedic way and i really appreciate the restraint when it came to naming pieces of artwork so that the picture we were presented with as readers was as clear as possible. also it was very refreshing to have the entire history of art in one volume, it really helps to convey the progress and evolution of art as it has happened (although it feeling a little rushed towards the end with so much innovation happening in such a short period of time) excellent for an introduction to western art, however despite the odd mention of eastern art there is barely any emphasis off europe throughout the book. i wish that this was considered more, also i wish that certain female artists were included too such as hilda af klimt and artemisa. i think they would have been welcome in a book that pretty much exclusively details in the art of old white men and classical antiquity. that being said i really enjoyed reading it, particularly the section on 14th-16th century italy i found fascinating as well as the chapters on egyptian and eastern art. will be coming back to the book for short, easily digestible sections on art periods i look at more in detail in the future. would highly recommend to anyone wanting to go into anything to do with history of art."
The Story of Art,"(3.5 stars) I was very happy with this book at the start. It was easy-reading – staying conversational and not getting too in-depth with the facts. It also had a lot of photos, which is a huge plus for me. As I got deeper into the book, however, the author had to reference way too much among the previous pages to make for easy reading. In the end, I can’t say this is anything more than a good textbook for a high school or college course. I like to casually read about art, but this became more than casual in approach. Not a bad book, just not exactly what I was looking for."
The Story of Art,"Not much to say about this one. The first textbook to read when trying to learn art history. I really liked how accessible and grounded his writing is. Explains each period, movement and work in the simplest of words. Particularly helpful are the references to works mentioned in previous pages or chapters and includes page numbers for easy browsing. Wish the man lived longer and kept updating the book with new chapters for each past decade. Saying that it is highly recommended is stating the obvious. What might be helpful is reading a paper version of the book instead of an ebook version. It's very visual."
The Story of Art,"Worth it for the illustrations alone, with a good assortment of sketches, paintings, sculpture, friezes, pottery, and architecture. It's not so much an introduction to art history, as it really is the ""story"" of art. Gombrich moves chronologically, with descriptions moving quickly from one thing to next, drawing small comparisons between different movements or artists. A very broad, light overview. Useful for someone who doesn't know much about art history."
The Story of Art,"Why doesn't Goodreads allow for half-star increments in their rating system? 7/10. I wish I had read the Story of Art sooner, when it was assigned as part of my post-secondary/sixth-form curriculum. Better late than never. As the go-to 'art history book' I'm happy to have completed it, even if it took me a while to get into the swing of things. The book is dense, and it can't afford not to be so. As a result of this it's not that easy to pick up, read, and consistently return to. I'm also happy to have one of the later editions of the book, as the chapters at the end offer interesting insight into art criticism and art historians. Honestly, I found this post script more enjoyable to read than some of the other sections of the book, which maybe means that I've been reading the wrong kind of art book. Either way, happy to have finished it as it serves as a great contextual jumping-off point if I ever wanted to explore any art movement more in depth. Worth the read."
The Story of Art,"SOA is actually an art appreciation book disguised as history, which probably explains why it is so deeply loved all over the world. Gombrich spends a good 85% of his time simply talking about individual pieces. Like any good tour guide, he merely explains a few details, gets out of the way, and lets the reader savor the view. Highly recommended."
The Story of Art,"Whew! A long dense read, but very ~enlightening~ It definitely is very euro-male centric and covers the basic bases, only touching on African and Asian art in order to acknowledge their influence on Italian, Dutch, and German men. However, I was a philistine when it came to many of these entry level masters and this book covered them fastidiously. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a survey of European painting and architecture!"
The Story of Art,"Currently crawling my way out of this reading slump, doesn’t help that I chose a 1000 pg book and a Literal Textbook for my summer reads … but this book really did what it set out to do! Followed a logical (western) timeline from Egyptian art to Greek, Roman, the weiird art from the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and all the -isms that followed. Gained a lovely big picture perspective on how art has changed in subject matter, purpose, and style. Very comforting, however, to learn how we’ve always been reveling in and experimenting with art and will carry on with this pursuit."
The Story of Art,"Amazing. As an introductory book it's just perfect, Gombrich explains the beginning and major movements in Art history, in a non academic-confusing way but to the point and very insightful. He ties together all the renowned artist and by setting the context, very nicely and clear, you understand the importance of their contribution to art and society. A must have at home!"
The Story of Art,Easy read with tons of information and interesting facts. Since it covers the entire history of art it's not thaaat detailed. Loved the illustration quality.
The Story of Art,"A marvelous book. Great introduction for beginners like me. Now I can understand a lot more, the paintings, sculptures and buildings that always amazed me."
The Story of Art,"As a relative ‘newbie’ to art, it was an overall very good book and introduction into the fascinating world of art history. It was really interesting to see how art has progressed over time and the effect of religion, revolution etc on art. It highlighted to me periods which i find fascinating and others which don’t interest me as much. The only downfall to this book is the lack of female representation and small focuses on architecture as that is not why i read the book."
The Story of Art,The most beautiful “thing” I’ve ever read.
The Story of Art,"In all honesty, I should have read this book before I even entered college or changed my major from journalism to art history, but now I am a college graduate, entering a Renaissance art graduate program, and I figured I needed some concise background information, so I decided to finally read this quite excessively long book. Gombrich does an excellent job summing up ancient and medieval art— I had never learned much about it in my undergraduate courses other than from the influence of Apollo Belvedere or Venus de Milo or Laocoon & His Sons on the artwork of the Renaissance, and I appreciated how he made it readable and understandable. When I got to the Renaissance, I got a little annoyed at some of the assumptions and implications that Gombrich wrote into the book— a lot of this didn’t seem like things I had learned in the Renaissance courses I have taken. The modern chapters (after Impressionism) were where I really got tripped up— this book was originally written in 1950, and of course Gombrich had no idea at the time that some artists working before that year would eventually become world renowned (and he even acknowledges this many times in his afterword) but the way he wrote in this chapter seemed uneven and not in line with how he discussed ancient and Renaissance art— almost like he was saying “All right well I guess I have to talk about this now.” Another thing I did not care for were how Gombrich would devote tiny tiny paragraphs to an artist, in any time period, who is now quite moderately well known, would then direct you to a sample of their artwork in the back of the book (and never even their best or most famous piece of artwork) and then move on. Why even include this random interlude if it’s better for you to just give us an overview? Ultimately I really appreciated how this book tied up a lot of loose ends for me before I begin my art history graduate program; Gombrich almost seamlessly ties the entire history of art from ancient Greeks to modern times and even though everything in me thinks that this is almost impossible, well, then Gombrich achieved the impossible. There is so much more to be said about the history of art, even at an introductory level, and sometimes I personally believe that Gombrich spent too much time on the wrong things. But in the end I’m glad I read this, and if you’re thinking of studying the history of art in college, read this and John Berger’s Ways of Seeing beforehand for a good head start."

The Story of Art,A must read for every artist.
The Story of Art,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers, that this should strictly be called the story of Western art, since there is little in there that's either from outside Europe or the US, and when there is, it's normally to illustrate the past of something that was American or European. Still, up to and including the beginning of the 20th Century, it's a fascinating read, and contains a wonderful history that charts most of the major movements and gives a great overview of how different sections of western art relate to each other. As the 20th Century progresses, however, one gains the impression that Gombrich loses heart somewhat, and the last sections of the book turn into little more than a lament at the direction in which art is heading. This leads to strange exclusions from the book (Pollock is in there, and Pop Art is rapidly dismissed, but Bacon and Rothko are entirely ignored). Still, it's a book that's remained essential reading for over half a century for a good reason, and it's well worth looking into."
The Story of Art,"It’s the second time I read this book cover to cover, not counting the endless times I’ve came to it for a chapter or two. Gombrich combines an encyclopedic knowledge about Art with his unique “anti-encyclopedic” insights: all the time he calls our attention to what’s really going on, how things connect to each other, the precise aspect that’s really important - and interesting - to take away, and so in. The introduction alone is a full journey into Art. I love that he chose the word “Story” instead of “History”: it’s all about the humans behind the works, starting with the very first phrase of the book: “THERE really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.” An awesome book to read as a story, and come back to, over and over. P.S.: his “history for kids” book is also awesome!"
The Story of Art,"The kind of book where you can feel your knowledge leveling up as you read. Gombrich is an easy to understand writer with a vast chamber of knowledge. He knows exactly what to say and what to leave out. I started reading books about art history to catch up to some of my peers in visual design college and I now feel like I've gotten even more than those who had been learning art history in school for years. Gombrich knows that what we humans recognize are patterns and a story is a pattern of information. We like them so much, we even learn them for fun. He uses the story format to convey a sense of consistency throughout the things he's trying to get across and succeeds in making his readers retain that knowledge."
The Story of Art,"Nice ""introduction"" (of around 650 pages, ahem) into art history. Gombrich is anything but objective, but equally enthousiastic about almost everything. It's a shame this book is too old to thoroughly incorporate art after 1950, and honestly it was hell to get through at the pace my course required, but I do feel like I've refreshed my knowledge and learned quite a few new things."
The Story of Art,"I read this when I studied History of Art, and loved it. I still love it to this day. It's accessible, non-pretentious, and examines art in a fascinating, revealing way. If you're studying the subject or simply love art, you'll definitely want to read this."
The Story of Art,"An amazing book. Funny how 600 pages can teach you how much there is to explore. With this book, I feel like I've only now just approached the surface so that I'll be able to scratch it if I pursue the subject further. Highly recommend—you will see the world differently."
The Story of Art,"Whose story? Who gets to tell it & for whom? Hard to read this and not be aware of its severe flaws, biases and limitations. Should come with massive disclaimers for those who’re inclined to read uncritically and take books at face value."
The Story of Art,HARMONY BALANCE NATURE
The Story of Art,"Lovely read for an art history beginner (me!). So accessible, I didn't feel intimidated by the material at all."
The Story of Art,where is the female artists?
The Story of Art,"I have heard of this book for some time but was always intimidated by its volume. At the start of this year, when I was strolling around in Cambridge, a place with lots of dear memory, I found a second-hand version of this book, with a flyer for a Degas exhibition inside. Opening the book that night at the hotel, the scent of old books struck me and I immediately indulged in the book. Five stars would be too few for this book. I wish I had started this book sooner - even before I knew this book. I wish I had read this in my early year of high school. It might have changed my life forever. Well, I think it has certainly changed me a lot during these several months. History is not my thing - I changed high school because I wouldn't need to study history in my new school. I have always found history dull and historians' fixation on years and meaning boring. However, this book on art history is educating and beautiful at the same time. I have rarely come across books and articles with such language as clear flowing water while stating the points clearly. The style of the language is a little bit old-school, which is a good thing in my view. Nowadays authors are no longer writing in such a modest but graceful way. I was touched deeply several times in my read. It wasn't because I was made sad, it was purely touching. The words and the images just stirred my emotion somehow. It was simply the power of art, I think. “There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists - men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful fit of balancing shapes and colours till they are ‘right’, and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work. Artists, we trust, will always be born. But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.” I came to tears when I read this. So many thoughts and memory came into my mind. I recall the time when I was happily doodling with my crayons, when my grandfather drew the scene of his childhood memory when we had projects about different art styles, when my art teachers patiently guided me through the steps of calligraphy arts, when I first came to the UK and visit the National Gallery with my friends… I wish I have more encounters with arts, I wish I had started sooner, but it’s never too late to start appreciating and reflecting. By talking about Art in such an engaging way, this book is a piece of art itself. Getting close to the end of the book, a rush of sadness came into me, and I couldn’t wait to read it again and again."
The Story of Art,"Just got through the last 4 chapters of the book and found myself so into it. I had never known that history book can be as captivating as this one. The narrative style is great, which helps to make sense of all the ambiguous events and movements in the history of art. I would give Sir Gombrich 5 stars for his talent of clarify things. This book is a helpful resource of radical explanations and supportive examples which helps me to strenthen my arguments on my crtitical analysis. It aims at answering my greatest concern toward the history of art: ""In which standard we define art ?"" All the examples were refered to this book. .. Inspecting the history of art from the nineteenth century, I am coming up with a very basic question: ""In which standard we define art ? Or is there a standard or a necessity to form ?"". As most art debates has no end and a question always provokes an infinite sequence of many other ones, I failed to determine a yes or no answer after the research but found it able to present several arguments. In the earlier period of time, the art standard was mainly set by artworks showing supreme skills of from leading masters, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Ruben, Goya,.. As there was an inevitable agreement on the level of excellence in their artworks, the definition of art at that time was concrete to define. However, the perception of art had changed so far that artistic expertise had no longer been judged merely by the objective supreme painting skills but by subjective approach. While the old school art theory presents an objective standard with definition of line, form, shape, color to define art value, the new school states that art is wholly subjective which determine a mean to expressing individuality. By this theory, artwork is evaluated through its capacity to impact viewer emotionally, psychologically, physically and spiritually. Though each school of thoughts present its drawback, does what matters just which school of thought that we choose to embrace ? The old school criticism prompts people to categorize art as orthodox art vs unorthodox art, low art vs high art, art vs non-art etc. It is needless to indicate the obsoleteness of the old-school objective criticism, which was confirmed in every period of the art development. The first reason is that most artists in every period had the great tendency to break the tradition. For instance,I take an insignificant but particular example of Edouard Manet (1832- 1883), one of the avant-garde who started the art revolution in French. By examining the traditional convention in painting of his time, he discovered that the whole claim of it was wholly based on misconception of shade and light, which made the representation of object in traditional art at that time very artificial. That said, the emergence of all art movements were fostered by the courage of artists to fearlessly examine the traditional convention, the quarrel they endured with the preceding masters and the desire of escaping from the deadlock that they found themselves in. Therefore, using objective convention from tradition to measure art can be improper. The second reason is that any definition on which we rely to evaluate art have been disparate through time. For instance, even the most successful art movement, French Impressionism was substantially rejected by not only critics but all section of public in its beginning. Impressionist’s painting was once thought to be mad and unorthodox because the viewers claimed they saw nothing in those paintings except a confusion of brushstroke. For a century later, since we extol Impressionism as the legend for innovation in art that moved art away from the precise imitation of reality to the representation of what we really see things, it is hard for us to understand why Impressionist had met such rejection at that period. But it is a considerable example for how definition of orthodox art differs over different period of time. Since, it is unavoidable to state every objective standard formed will soon be replaced by another one. On the other hand, the subjective approach to art criticism results in the likeliness to mislead the evaluation of art. There are many modern artworks which are personally hard to understand. They are, for example, the Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings of dripping paint, the Black Square(1915) by Malevich or the Fountain of Marcel Duchamp(1917). Since I am clueless to find the level of supreme skills in the creation of these works labelled as art, I find the necessity to rely on the new school of thought to define the artistic value in those works. However, owing to the subjectivity, it is likely to use the new school of thought as an excuse for poor artistic skill and an exhaustion of creativity. Hence there is a tendency that the art value is exaggerated by critics, while the artists’ attempt might only is to shock the public and stand out. Since there is no concrete standard to judge, the art evaluation leaves a huge gap of ambiguity. Art is both unnecessary and unable to be standardized The perception to art considerably fluctuates. Gombrich stated that artists only mission is to create things, which had never existed before. That explains why artist always struggle to break the tradition, seek for new problem and solution for unsolved issue. I take Paul Cezanne as an example. As the current Impressionism had gained a complete triumph in making a conquest of nature, Cezanne decided that there would be no gain to pursue that movement further; then he tried to start everything from scratch again, seeked for new problems and struggled to solved it. Thanks to his endeavour, new possibilities in art had been explored which fostered the new art movement in the early 20th century. That said, it is impossible to standardize art. Due to the perpetual finding of new problems to solve, artists always dissatisfied with the current standard. Since Cezanne felt the loss of the sense of order and balance; Van Gogh felt art lost the sense of intensity and passion; Gauguin dissatisfied with current life and art; their struggle to find solution urge to the start of three new movements, respectively Cubism, Expressionism and Primitivism. Gombrich also indicated that the modern art we see today mostly grew out from the feelings of dissatisfaction that is just mentioned. Once again, the art history proved the unnecessity of such art standard as well as the impossibility to form an art definition because every standard established will be soon intentionally challenged and altered. “ Art history is a weaving and changing of tradition, in which each works refer to the past and point to the future.” There is no such thing as art. There are only people willing to undergo the long run of finding solution for new coming problems who are labelled as artists (Gombrich, 2006). And then what makes their works differentiated is how long their value remained to be praised through time. The continual emergence of new perception in art is a great stimulation for the new possibilities."
The Story of Art,"Enjoy it for What It Is... I was recommended this book as somebody who knew nothing about art. And I struggle to imagine a better presented introduction to this vast topic. The author states in the fifteenth edition preface ‘In writing [this book] I thought first and foremost of readers… who had just discovered the world of art for themselves.’ And I felt he guided me through the labyrinth in a straight line. The book presents a chronological story. ‘The story’ begins with some of the earliest known examples of cave images. It continues through ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and China before continuing its predominant focus on Europe until reaching the present day. It touches on the influence of art on these societies and the influence of these societies on art. Methods and trends are also touched on. And on occasion it links generations of artists’ stories together such as Leonardo to Michelangelo to Raphael. It contains illustrations throughout. These illustrations are referred to by the text. I think criticisms of this book come when one takes it out of context. Any criticism I have heard, always from a connoisseur, can be summarized in one sentence: A more accurate title would be ‘A Story of Predominately Western Art’. However, if this book is taken as the author intended it to be, one will struggle to find any book that better achieves such an ambitious intention."
The Story of Art,"It is a pleasure to read story of art -some part of it as the focus is European art - as a continuous weaving of many creators, disobedient minds , sometimes heretics and changers of traditions , challenging the past with dissatisfaction and pointing the future with an inevitable end to be challenged as a past chapter of the story. It is still provocative after many years , although it may be classified as an introductory book , for thoughts about the question of what art is or whether there is something called art or there is just artist as Gombrich wrote at the introduction of the book . Then the questions : all this is about what ? Mimesis, expression , kind of construction of another realm , just something new ? It is good to have these questions in mind while going through the centuries behind the stories of many artists looking for ways to create , express, challenge. Probably the pleasure was endorsed as I read the copy from 1950 , third edition which has been at my library for last 30 years waiting to be read. As art is a shelter against the dismay, these Pandemic days was probably time to read it."
The Story of Art,"The story of art told as the story of a continuous weaving and changing of traditions in which each work refers to the past and points to the future... Starting from prehistoric and primitive peoples and finishing with the 20th century, Gombrich takes you through a journey which shows how interestingly a living chain of tradition links the art of our own days with that of the Pyramid age. For there seems to be no such thing as art, but there are artists who 'possess the integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forego all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work'. - 700 pages, with pictures taking 50% of it. - Definitely the world's best selling art book as of today. - Definitely must-read if you have ever felt lost in a museum."
The Story of Art,"I've read it with the enthusiasm of a child that has a great new toy and is eager to test it in all the possible ways. I started looking at buildings with different eyes. I started analyzing all the museums I've been to and all the paintings I've seen. I was calling my friends in the middle of the night to ask them if they knew something I read and seemed so logical and yet we haven't thought about it. This book is amazing for people who desire a brief introduction into Arts and need something to start with. What I missed (and even the author has a long ""disclaimer"" about it) was more info and appreciation on Contemporary Art. I understand why it is difficult to write about something happening now and I understand there are a large number of artists to pick from. But nevertheless I felt Gombrich does not really appreciate Contemporary Art. I was disappointed about his presentation on Surrealism but as I kept reading I understood his point of view. That being said, the book is a fantastic introduction into visual arts up to Surrealism. After that point everything is open for debate :)"
The Story of Art,"- Understanding the history of art as an evolution process, overcoming the predecessors as the bieggest challenge in the scene. - The book allows you to identify the 'differences' between the previous masters and the newer talents, and it provides period-specific information that helps you understand why each piece was so revolutionary for its time. - When art(ists) freed themselves of clients, the market appeared. - A collection of forewords provided at the beginning of the Korean edition (2017, Yekyong) does tell you that time flies. Yet so many shared aspects and viewpoints from the 1950s and the present world."
The Story of Art,"Extraordinary. And exceedingly good book, circumventing the jargon and pompousness of art historians, it illustrates the history - and story - of art in a most down-to-earth manner, clearly and concisely. For the uneducated reader as myself, it was an unparalleled reading. I guess the most striking element is Prof. Gombrich's ascetic take, to only mention and explore works of art contained in the book, discerning with clarity their composition, which techniques were employed in their creation, and above all, how their story interlaced, what changes came with the years, the problems of each generation, the composers and artists who tackled them - who succeeded, and why."
The Story of Art,"A very precious book to deal with and a very intellectual writer. Gombrich has a very classic and smooth style of writing about Art. He summarized the history of art from the ancient era into contemporary in 27 chapters. Followed by a chapter that revealed his approach towards visual art. The writer picked some of the most distinguished paintings in each era, which crystalized the main figures and approach of drawings then. The book is writing in a first person narrator as a story to be retold unlike the documentaries books. Moreover, it has a plenty of visual art and paintings revealing the schools of art followed by a detailed timeline and a map to follow the era were discussed in the book. I enjoyed keeping it as a reference."
The Story of Art,"I have started this book with very basic knowledge of art per se, and after finishing it I still do have a very basic knowledge of it. I don't see the objective of this book as teaching you Art, but teaching how Art had to change and evolve to overtake obstacles and challenges of every century. Most importantly is an amazing guide on how to look at art in order to understand it more deeply if you would like to go further in your personal study."
The Story of Art,"There's a lot to love here, like Gombrich's formidable intellect, deep learning and sensitivity combined. He can make you see shop worn works such as Mona Lisa and Rafael's Madonnas with new eyes, and help you see why they were important and continue to be great works of art. But the book was first written in the 50's, and it shows."
The Story of Art,Amazing book for everybody who's eager to read about the artists journey through the ages. The content isn't too detailed with overwhelming facts so it's very much convenient for people who has little knowledge about art or architecture. The book author takes the advantage to show us many unfamiliar works and places.
The Story of Art,"Read this for uni — well and understandably written, was easy to follow his thoughts and ideas. Now I know more about art and architecture. More specifically about art, he could’ve written more about architecture, though."
The Story of Art,"So glad I got the physical version after trying to read this on the kindle. Beautiful art, including fold outs, with interesting anecdotes and explanations of stylistic choices. Reading about architecture might be one of the worst things of all time tho... Anyways glad I finally finished this and I'm super excited that galleries are opening up again! (We have art lest we perish from the truth)"
The Story of Art,"A very enjoyable overview of art history by a master in story-telling. Although euro-centric in most parts, Gombrich's approach tries to keep an eye in what's going worldwide. His style is accessible but still far from dull."
The Story of Art,Great introductory text to Western art history
The Story of Art,Read about art in the Middle Ages pages 185-245. Very nice pictures and explanations of the development of artistic styles. Easy to understand.
The Story of Art,"The pace very well developed, definetly well written so really satisfying and the cinematography certainly stannig and so very very satisfying."
The Story of Art,Great one to get for friends who “want to know more about art”.
The Story of Art,Excellent books about Art history. This is the only book you need for researching.
The Story of Art,It’s not really a story of global art but a story of Western Art.
The Story of Art,Essential
The Story of Art,"Fabulous journey of (mostly Western) Art explained in great detail. Definitely recommend the bigger paperback or the hardcover and not the pocket version, given the amount of content!"
The Story of Art,"Not sure which will be the greater achievement this year between finishing this and finishing medschool. Anyway, good intro into the world of art!"
The Story of Art,"What a tremendous resource for learning about art - and instantly an all-time favorite book of mine. The narration is engaging and accessible, and the setup of this edition (with text in front and illustrations arranged in back) made it easy to follow along and study each exhibit. I gained a real appreciation for the overall ’story of art’ - the themes at play and problems and solutions faced by and encountered by art in various historical and social contexts - as well as fantastic introductions to many significant artists. The original book was published shortly after WW2, and since then Gombrich added several additional intro and conclusion sections in subsequent editions, which can be found here and serve as nice time capsules. The central takeaways of this book for me are 1) there is no art without artists 2) the story of art is a nonlinear one without any defined endpoint, with plenty of zigs and zags, as solutions are devised to solve problems which then open up new problems 3) art requires some societal/historical motivational core (the grain at the center of a pearl) to thrive. * Primitive art - drawing faces from individual shapes; evolution from there to new types of art was not about advances in technology, but changes in ideas (of what should be depicted and how) * Egypt - particular style of painting, everything follows set laws (depicting human body parts in different ways / planes based on how they were best conveyed rather than how they appeared) - little evolution over time (until Tut, new ways of depicting); sacred purpose of portraits in tombs. Painting from knowledge. * Greek revolution: bursts of creativity, adherence to Egyptian technique combined with freedom to deviate from sacred rules on human form; beginnings of foreshortening; Athenian democracy ~ evolving identity of artists; paintings / statues alongside poems and plays as things to discuss. Portraits evolved later in Greek era - sculptures of Alexander. * Hellenistic art - Greek civilization spread via Alexander, into ‘Hellenistic’ world. Art became intentionally more impressive (Corinthian columns evolving from Doric/Ionic). Rich people collecting art made artists more important; prevalence of art in Pompeii (an otherwise ordinary provincial town in Hellenic world) illustrates this evolution * Rome - borrowing things they liked from Greece; triumphal arches / columns (influenced sacred depictions in Jewish, Indian art) * Religion and art - what can / should be depicted? Pope Gregory - art educates the illiterate and has important purpose * Major significance of Byzantine art - images as holy, maintained old eastern / Egyptian traditions and fused to religious art - preserved traditions for later eras, provided bridge to Renaissance * Middle ages / dark ages * Local tribal art fused with Christianity * Egyptians painted what they knew; Greeks what they saw; Middle Ages what they felt (religious depictions convey this). Middle Ages survival bias - religious art lasted, privately owned art destroyed * Evolution of Norman / Romanesque architecture styles. Gothic - extension of Romanesque, greater use of arches, expanding into stained glass. Gothic art - methods of art as means to end, of telling sacred stories better * Giotto (Florence 13th century) - begins era of artist as part of history of art; first artist to harness Hellenistic technique preserved by Byzantines, add creativity, and transform Gothic lifelike sculpture into painting * International style (14th century) - Italian (kept Byzantine art alive) and French ideas spread across Europe; depicting nature became important -> depicting humans accurately -> renewal of classical styles * Renaissance - key pillars: 1) scientific / mathematical perspective 2) close observation of nature / understanding of human anatomy 3) learning from antiquity / classical forms of sculpture, architecture, art * Early Renaissance pioneers: Brunelleschi, Donatello (architecture, sculpture) * Northern vs Southern Renaissance: Italian art began with scientific perspective / outlines / understanding of body; Dutch added detail upon detail to resemble reality (van Eyck - oil painting) * High Renaissance in Florence / Rome - changing status of artist, determination to be more than craftsman, equal with scholar or poet. Leonardo - use of science to elevate painting above humble art; sfumato technique - blurring of outlines + mellow colors allowing merging of forms, leaving more to viewer’s imagination. Michelangelo - papal commissions, extended Leonardo’s focus on human body and emphasized this exclusively, accurate painting of form. Raphael - ‘idea of beauty’, simplicity of Madonnas, fluidity of bodies in motion. * Venice - Titian, expert handling of paint - allowed to break rules of composition (position of virgin etc) and make up for it with colors. Bellini, Correggio - use of color and light to balance forms. Importance of color in Venice, influenced by eastern linkages. * Spread into north. Durer - studied in southern Europe and traveled to Venice as artist; combined northern (earlier Gothic) style (nature, extreme detail) with Italian Renaissance ideals of beauty - to tell sacred stories. Bosch - synthesis of old (primal fears, depictions of evil) with new (methods of portraying) * Later Renaissance - crises of art in 16th century; idea that art had reached perfection in Renaissance, so what to do next? * Mannerism (imitation of Michelangelo), Parmigiano, Cellini - quest for unusual / interesting even at expense of natural beauty (modern) * Southern art: Tintoretto - legacy of Titian painting, fused with mystery - feel thrill and tension of drama (St Mark’s remains, St George / dragon). El Greco - Spanish mysticism, also realist portraiture * Reformation challenges in north - outlawing of religious imagery removed major market for art. Great artists left for England - Holbein the Younger - portraits of masterly restraint painted at Henry VIII court. Dutch art survived Reformation best - genre paintings, follies of everyday life - Bruegel the Elder * 17th century: Baroque / neoclassical art, following from Greco / Tintoretto (complicated compositions, showcasing light and color) * Rome: schools of Caracci v Caravaggio. Caracci - classical scenes, beauty, inspiration by Raphael - development of neoclassical style (influenced Reni, Poussin, Lorrain - who influenced later landscape painters). Caravaggio - naturalism, faithful looks at nature, truth over beauty - unafraid to paint ugliness of reality. * Rubens - synthesis of Caracci (classical scenes) with Caravaggio (naturalism) and Flemish/Dutch tradition (not focused on standards of beauty, attention to detail). Ability to make scenes (large scale or portraits) come to life in ‘painterly’ way. * Artists influenced by Rubens. Van Dyck - painter at court of Charles I, elegant portraits of royals. Velásquez - court of Philip IV in Spain, learned from Italy - inspired initially by Caravaggio, then by Rubens and Titian; forerunner of Impressionism, capturing real moments (Las Meninas) * Protestant Northern Europe: changing marketplace post-Reformation; commission practice ending, so artists had to sell art to public, leading to greater specialization. Growing embrace of idea of ‘picturesque’ landscapes. Rembrandt - etchings, inspired by Caravaggio; self portraits, portraits - sense of being face to face with real people, illustrating depth of souls, displaying ability to understand all types of men; light and shade used to enhance scene’s drama. Still lifes - subject became incidental to importance of painting. Vermeer, still lifes with people - unique contrast of mellowness / precision * 18th century: peak of Baroque art/architecture around 1700 * Versailles as epitome of baroque styling (without baroque approach would be monotonous); boom in similar palaces and monasteries around Europe. Decline in importance of individual arts - art focused on building these grand spaces. * England. St Paul’s - baroque or not? Restrained, Italian Renaissance styling, church as place for contemplation not otherworldly vision. Country house > palace; classical stylings that don’t break rules; legacy of Claude Lorrain. Hogarth - moral tales in engravings. Reynolds (founded Royal Academy) vs Gainsborough; parallel to Caracci/Caravaggio. Reynolds - favored imitation of Italian Renaissance masters (similar thinking to Caracci), elevation of painting as intellectual pursuit, importance of painter’s ideas; paintings sometimes a bit labored. Gainsborough - simplicity, nature as teacher, straightforward portraits emphasizing good brushwork, and landscapes. * New directions around French Revolution: growing collector taste for novelty; shift from old ways of teaching to academies (created new crises of lack of interest in new art vs old, and unsubtle works at academy shows); embrace of older styles (Classical Greek, Gothic) in favor of baroque / rococo / neoclassical architecture in US. * Portrayal of recent history and heroic figures with lessons for present - Copley, Jacques-Louis David. Goya - portraits in style of old masters (Van Dyck ) with artistic skill of Titian, but new eyes and lack of flattery. Romantic poetry spilling into painting - painting from inner vision, Goya and Blake. * Popularity of landscapes - 2 camps in England. Turner - obsessed with improving on traditions (Claude Lorrain) - motion and complexity, human emotion reflected in nature. Constable - no need for trickery, honest simplicity best - don’t outshine nature. * 19th century: industrial revolution, mass production, decline in public taste - conflict between artists and public, split between artists doing ‘official’ work and those outside mainstream. Paris as center of art world. * France: Ingres (conservative painter following David, technical smooth perfection) vs Delacroix (movement, excitement of a scene). Corot as a bridge in approaches: capture truth in general forms / tones - achievements of palette (use of colors harmonized with gradation of tone). Barbizon school - following Constable, seeing nature with fresh eyes; Millet - landscape approach taken to figures; Courbet - realism a la Caravaggio. Rossetti, pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, truth over beauty - artistic dead end? * Impressionism - beginning of idea of art as studying/solving particular problems. Manet - revolution in depicting colors; classical masters of color as inspiration (Titian, Velásquez, Goya); illusion of depth via simple flat forms. Monet - painting in front of motif rather than studio; technological changes e.g rapid strokes and no time to mix paints, effect of whole over specific details. Renoir - inspired by crowd scenes (following Jan Steen), but shifted focus onto effect of light. Degas - ballet, unexpected angles used to study space / forms; objective / dispassionate (interest in movement / space, not in beauty of subject). Rodin - unfinished looking works. Contributing factors to development of Impressionism: 1) photography (art needed to evolve new aims) 2) Japanese woodblock prints becoming prevalent and introducing new ideas of perspective / completeness. Ideas around Impressionism - ideas of finishedness (borrowed from Rembrandt - artist’s right to declare when finished); overcoming knowledge of form as obstacle to enjoyment. * Late 19th century: triumph of Impressionism, what next? 3 post impressionist masters - dissatisfied in different ways, led to new traditions of modern art. Shared willingness to sacrifice correctness of outlines to accomplish different aims. None of these artists were well-known/understood in their times. * Cezanne - felt order/balance lost in Impressionist messiness; sought reconciliation of methods of Impressionism (paint what one saw) with balance/harmony (‘paint Poussin from nature’); influenced Cubism * Van Gogh - felt intensity / passion of art was lost in focus on visual impression. Brushstrokes to convey artist’s excitement (flamelike strokes); influenced Expressionism * Gauguin - dissatisfied generally with life and art, aimed for simplicity through exploration of native culture; influenced Primitivism * Modern art. Influence of architecture - Bauhaus, functionalism. Extension of ideas of what painter should paint - paint what he sees? We can’t separate what we see from what we know. * Expressionism - painting of feelings, Munch’s scream; focus not just on pleasant things. Abstract art - Kandinsky first to paint without recognizable object. * Fauvism - Matisse, 1900s Paris. Decorative simplification, use of colors. Cubism, Picasso - problems of form; one solution to essential tension in art (depth on surface), experiments in modeling; recognizable objects, pictures made of uniform parts so whole looks consistent in spite of unfamiliarity. Return to Egyptian principles of painting from knowledge of objects. Klee - new possibilities of forms, nature creates through artist; artist creates something new rather than replicating reality. * Primitivism - lasting effects of Gauguin, theme that influenced much later art - quest for native/childlike simplicity - Rousseau, Chagall, Wood. Surrealism - Freudian inspiration, dreamscapes; Magritte (self portrait of artist creating new reality), Dali. Pollock, start of AbEx - unifying two strands 1) childlike simplicity / spontaneity 2) sophisticated interest in problems of painting * What drives art? Core task set by community / society; always new challenges to pursue even as art evolved, new solutions led to new challenges. Modern art - prevalence of old/new theories provide core impetus for art’s evolution."
The Story of Art,"An insightful book, definitely recommend to everyone who wants to learn about art, amateur or professional. It could work great as a starting guide, which you can come back to anytime."
The Story of Art,"This book was a great introduction to Art History (and Art, with a capital A :)) for a total beginner such as myself. I am sure it has many issues that are visible to the learned eye. I look forward to discover its problems and inadequacies as I learn more."
The Story of Art,"What can I say… a great book! and a marvelous eye-opening to art, which offered me understanding, finally! 🖖"
The Story of Art,"I read this on my history of visual art class, very insightful and is SO easy to understand, it doesn't use unnecessary technical terminology so good good 😊"
The Story of Art,"A very enjoyable journey through the span of art history. Gombrich tells the story concretely with charming writing. Moreover, he skilfully chains various periods together by referring to past and future works relative to the discussed period. This really helped me getting an overview, since I did not the read the book in one go."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"These kind of books are like candy. They make me feel better in the moment, but ultimately don't do much towards building a full picture of happiness. The inherent problem in any book that's a how-to for something artistic, whether it be writing or painting or making music or the artistry in tailoring a custom Voltron costume, the problem with the how-to book is that when you're reading the how-to book you're not doing the actual thing you're being taught to do. In other words, a book ABOUT writing is probably less helpful to a writer than a book that's just plain good. A how-to book about painting is probably of less use than a book of paintings you enjoy. I'm not saying there's no place for these types of books, and this one is smart because it's a quick read and it sticks pretty well to the motivational side of things as opposed to the nuts and bolts. It's good to read motivational stuff, especially because creating art can be a pretty lonely process. It's just hard to pack away the awareness that while you're reading about creating art, you could spend that time creating art."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,this book was incredible. i feel so inspired and motivated!
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Steal Like an Artist is essential and required reading for all artists, regardless of the type of art you create. It's a quick read that you can finish in one sitting, but the ideas and advice it contains will stay with you long after you've put it down. Some of Austin's suggestions will validate what you're already doing, some will challenge you to fundamentally change a creative practice, others will inspire you to grab a notebook and get to work immediately. Because it's such a small and accessible book, you'll want to go back to it from time to time. Just like Stephen King's , as you change and grow as an artist, it reveals new ideas and inspirations to you that you may have missed on a previous read. This is a fantastic addition to your library, and a wonderful gift for any creative person in your life."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"(This review is longer than the book itself.) Here are the Top Ten Points that the author makes in this teeny book: 1. Steal like an artist 2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started 3. Write the book you want to read 4. Use your hands 5. Side projects and hobbies are important 6. Do good work and share it with people 7. Geography is no longer our master 8. Be nice (the world is a small town) 9. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done) 10. Creativity is subtraction It's all very good advice. It's all great reminders. But that's what these are - reminders. The beef I have with self-help or how-to books is that the information inside the covers is stuff you already know. You just haven't thought about it before. This isn't to say that these books aren't helpful for many - but for people who are too busy (or, in extreme cases, too lazy) to think for themselves. They can read the books and their third eye can open and they can think they've just broke new ground... and then they don't go off to do what it is they were learning how-to do. What is good about Kleon's book is that he acknowledges almost immediately that there is no such thing as originality. Had he not written that very early on I'd be calling him a hypocrite right now for trying to pass any of this off as original. But that wasn't his intention - he saw a market for his advice and he went with it, so I give him props for that. It's just that I'm such a cynical person anyway, I'm wary of these sorts of ""guides"". I'd much rather a person just muddle through on their own based on their own experiences, learning from all the good and the bad that happens, and creating something out of all of that. This is a Hot Topic sort of creativity - mass marketed, polished, packaged. So why did I read it? Great question, because this is not at all my thing. I was curious, primarily. I came across his name because I came across someone's blog where the author was writing about her journal, which led to her discussion of Kleon's log books, and I was curious to see what he could possibly say about creativity. That's One. Two: I'm fascinated by the creative process. What works for me and my creativity is going to be completely different from my boyfriend's creative process, or my best friend's creative process, or the stranger down the street. I like reading about the daily process that my favorite writers/musicians/artists/people to get into their creative groove because it's fascinating, not because I want to copy them (though Kleon recommends a lot of copying; and this isn't to say there's anything wrong with it, per se, but it's not my motivation). The information here isn't necessary for the stuff people generally consider ""creative"" - some of stuff is helpful just in your daily life. People think a 9-to-5 job is energy-sapping and you can't be creative in your boring white-collar job, and those people sit back and do... well, very little of anything... and judge the rest of us who have to work for what we want and say we're not creative. I am creative in my job as much as possible and on paper it's not a very creative position. I have to be creative to find ways of being creative. And when it works, it works well, and it comes up in my annual reviews regularly, so I'm occasionally doing something right. This book is a good reminder for people in those positions too, who think they aren't in any position to be creative. Don't get all stuck on what you or are not doing, don't compare yourself to other people. (That's not even a part of Kleon's advice. That one comes from me. And a bunch of other people.) The part I like the best is #5. Hobbies important. I always have a side project of some sort, but I have yet to figure out how to consistently have energy after my stupid 9-to-5 job (actually it's a 7-something-to-4-something job, but that's beside the point). I was hoping for some insight from Kleon on that, but it wasn't really there. He basically just said ""Hey, you can do this!"" which, yeah, okay, thanks, I tell myself that every day, but I'm still tired and sapped. Probably from all that creativity I do at work - coming up with ways not to kill people or worry about backstabbing takes a crapload of energy and creativity. So, again, great reminders here, and really great for Millennials and Gen Y and whatever generation comes after those kids (have they been named yet??). It's a fast read, hopefully inspiring, even if for just the moment. But don't get bogged down by it. Read it because it's fast and easy, feel good for a few, and then go on and do your thing. Do . That's all you can answer to regularly anyway. The other thing I fully 100-bajillion% agree with Kleon about - keep a journal. Do whatever you want in those pages, but keep thing. If you want to be creative in any way, that's going to be your rock. I fill mine with everything. EVERYTHING. You could flip through them, but you'd think I am a serial killer. I mean it's all very insane in these journals. (And I would have to kill you after you flipped through them, so.) But that's what works for me. Figure out what works for you and do that. You'll appreciate it later. A little heavy-handed with all the quotes, but again, feels more geared towards younger readers anyway, and hopefully many readers will want to know more about those quoted people which is certainly Kleon's point. And on that note (I can quote too!), I'll share one of my favorites from David Foster Wallace's :"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This was such a phenomenal and much needed read for me. gives ideas that apply to anyone who’s trying to inject some creativity into their life and their work. It really inspired me and I can’t wait for what’s next. Also, can I just quote everything? Because I really need and want to: (Those were some of my personal favorites.) And this book also included pictures within, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It's a very quick and honest read. I highly recommend it! ,"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Posted at Shelf Inflicted This eye-catching little book was wedged into the corner of one of the couches in the student lounge where I work. I was there for a cup of coffee, and since it was a rather slow day, I decided to pick up the book and read. There’s a lot of common sense stuff in here for all types of creative people. You don’t have to be an artist or writer to benefit from these inspirational bits. They can help those who want to be more creative at work, or find room in one’s life for a hobby when time is in short supply. There are other tips for managing one’s life in order to be able to spend the time doing creative and fulfilling work. I really like this advice: It’s a short, fun book, and not a bad way to spend 30 minutes. Perfect to read in the student lounge, on the bus, or on the toilet."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Austin Kleon's ""Steal Like An Artist"" is a fun little book. Given that I'm not an artist - I wasn't seeking 'words- of -wisdom'. This book just landed in my hands - and I couldn't resist reading it. Austin says ""every artist gets asked the question, ""where do you get your ideas?"" Austin says....'The honest artist answers', ""I steal them""...... ............as in RIPS THEM OFF? Perhaps a more 'kind' way to answer the question --- is an artist draws inspiration from others. But what do I know. I'm not an artist. This little book is filled with fun engaging anecdotes.....with a list of 10 things to do to unlock our creativity. #9 is BE BORING!!! I've got that one down!!! I'm a master of boring!!!......but creative? I have my doubts! He recommended 10 books we should read: I've only read 1 on his list. ""Bird by Bird"". By Anne Lamott. -- Proof: I AM NOT CREATIVE?/! But..... Austin listed THINGS WE MUST DO: Take a walk --- works for me!!! Start your swipe file --- What the hell is a swipe file? Go to the library --- I DO! Buy a notebook and use it ----Done! Get yourself a Calendar ----Done! Start your logbook---For what? Give a copy of this book away-----More sales for Austin Kleon - ok - I'm willing! Start a blog --- You've got to be kidding: Goodreads takes enough time. Take a nap!!!!!!! ---- Favorite advice in the book!!! This is a great book to read 'while' being lazy - boring - sleepy - in your pj's -when you need something 'little & lightweight' to hold in your hands!"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"The sub-title of this book is '10 things nobody told you about being creative'. Yeah, probably because they thought you already knew them. This book is packed to the brim with platitudes such as: try to do good work, there are lots of different things to consider when choosing a place to live, it's important to be careful who you marry, money is really important, try to find a day job that you like and, my favorite, take $10 to the stationers and buy some stuff - then you can write your ideas down. Genius. The contradictions here are irritating also. He says that computers are soul suckers and time wasters and then says that it's great to create blogs and that it's important to have an online community of friends, he says ignore your critics and then recommends keeping a praise file to use at times of insecurity. It's all a little weird. It's not that I disagree with the guy, although he has a few ideas that seem strange to me, it's just that everything here is so bland that I wonder what the purpose of this book is, except that it might have something to do with 'money being really important' to the author. Maybe the main title of the book should read 'Steal Like An Artist...from gullible readers'."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I recently went to an artist lecture at the Phoenix Art Museum. The audience was a mix of young artists trying to make their way, fans of the artist, and amateur art enthusiasts just there for the experience. While offering words of wisdom to the young artists in the crowd, he said: “every day you have to wake up in the morning and tell yourself a story, even if it’s bullshit.” He was referring to the dark voice that talks to artists who haven’t made it big yet. Writers and musicians have that dark voice also. It’s that dark voice that whispers into your ear at night and tells you that your work isn’t good enough. That dark voice that tells you someone has already made something like this before. That dark voice that tells you, you’re a fraud. That dark voice that tells you that you can’t be like your favorite author. That dark voice that tells you that you’d rather be watching Netflix than writing. That dark voice that whispers “no one wants to read this shit”. This book is for writers, artists, and musicians. This book is the “bullshit” you have to tell yourself. This book is the middle finger to that dark voice that creeps into your subconscious."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I find it difficult to review ""Steal Like an Artist"" because the book is an amalgamation of advice, anecdotes, and uncommon sense. Austin Kleon writes in an easy-to-follow style, instructing readers about how to be creative without talking down to anyone. In fact while I read the book, I felt like I was part of some secret creators club, with this book as the secret club manual. The book focuses on 10 rules for people to follow in order to be creative. Rule number one is ""Steal like an artist."" The other nine are printed on the back of the book, but simply knowing the rules does not give you an edge in creativity. You need the explanations, the stories, the logic behind the rules that Mr. Kleon provides to get that tingly feeling (figuratively speaking, of course). I recommend this book for anyone over the age of 10, anyone who loves to create but feels stifled in today's world, anyone who loves to think, and anyone doing anything at all creative."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I'm undecided on this book. While I appreciate the premise — draw inspiration from people you admire and surround yourself with good role models — I'm uneasy with the ""steal"" concept. The title grabs attention, but I think it overshadows the actual point, which is not to become a replica of someone else but to create more authentic work by creating work you love. It's a bit overly simplistic, and definitely a short, fast read. For those who stand on the precipice, afraid to answer the call of creative spirit, it will serve as a ""soft entry"" to better books, like Anne Lammott's ""Bird by Bird,"" Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" and Julia Cameron's ""The Sound of Paper."" For tired, disillusioned creatives, it may also reinvigorate. Those in the thick of creating will probably want something meatier. Reading Kleon's book, I can see some of his influences, particularly a heavy nod toward bloggers-cum-authors like Seth Godin and Hugh MacLeod. I also drink the Kool-Aid offered by Godin, MacLeod, Johnny B. Truant, Brian Clark of Copyblogger, Chris Guillebeau of The Art of Non-Conformity, and others. I like them all and find inspiration often in their words. But if you're young and impressionable, if you are on the edge of your art and not fully-formed, it's easy to miss the deeper points they make. It's easy to miss the parts where they say it's hard and often sucks and sometimes seems pointless and sometimes is a colossal failure. Their passion for what they do is so charismatic that it's easy to get swept away, missing the part where they learned — through trial, error, mentors or schooling — how to market themselves effectively, how to manage money, how to lose the ""romance"" of being an artist and still find pleasure when the passion grows cool. It's not enough to love what you do. Perhaps that sounds harsh, perhaps it's a cynical, jaded worldview. It's tempered by experience. Loving your craft is fine if you want it to be a hobby. But if you want to keep a roof over your head with the work you produce, if you want to make a living at it until the end of your days, love will not keep you alive. I worry for the writers, journalists and photographers who load up on humanities courses in college, the ones who believe suffering for your craft is noble — or eventually successful. Please, please, creative types ... take a few business classes. Maintain a broad skill set. Don't tangle your identity up in your art or your profession, because if anything takes those away, you will be left rootless, drifting, and the road to recovery will be very, very hard. I know I sound jaded and bitter. I'm not at all. I'm still passionate about what I do. But that passion is tempered by the pesky ""reality thing"" I always preferred to ignore. I never wanted to be bothered by the ""boring"" things like money, accounting, contracts, marketing. But these are the things that provide the income to keep DOING your art. If you're going to steal like an artist, steal the business sense they bring to the table as well. I promise, you will never regret the time you spend learning the mechanics behind the career. With any luck, it will enable you until the end of your days to create wonderful things only you can bring to the world. Starving artists living in garrets can produce great work. But smart artists will find the road so much easier and equally as fulfilling."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷 I love how after I finished Kleon’s other book, I wanted to check out more of his works, and then found out that this book is his most famous work! I also like the fact that his book titles sound like a click bait but after reading them you will realize that they are accurate. The book does not encourage stealing or plagiarism and I found out that I have been stealing like an artist for a long period of time, the point is that most things have been done or said so you take a bit from everywhere, add your own touch and voila, you are a new artist now! The book had many great quotes from many different people! I have been applying this in medicine, in school, in reviews and in almost everything I do. The book is easy to read, uses drawings and bullet points which makes it fun! This is the author’s style in this series of books and I recommend reading them if you have an extra hour of time that you would like to kill!"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Not sure what I think about it. Many things are just rehashed stuff from elsewhere. And steal? Like an artist? Yeah, there are lots of controvercies and the plagiaristic hearings are among the most unclear and pointless ones, I say. Still, ouch. And steal?? Some of us steal inspiration from sun, rehash Picasso, get the energy to do wonderful staff brom bipolar disorder and technique from schisophrenia, and yeah, it's totally all right to do any of that. Some don't. Many don't. Still, it's all right to flip through someone else's work to try and get new things done, things that haven't yet been done. Just don't steal literally, it's not nice. A lot of inspiration to go around. Q: If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room. (c)"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"The advice is so generic that it ends up being nothing more than empty blanket statements. It's forgettable, shallow, and serves no great purpose. The book is more of the author's art project to further build his personal brand -- still, you would think the project could be a little more original or valuable."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I expected: Manual that teaches how one should look for, analyse, copy, rethink, redesign and come up with new, IDEAS. What I've got: Probably outdated 100th iteration on how to live great life by unfocused, average person reconstructed from numerous stick-it notes around his desk. Still not sure how 90% of the text was relevant to the idea on the cover. Beware: Even thinking about the title of the book will give you more relevant ideas than those contained within it. Don't buy it. And definitely steal something else."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"About a year ago, I was at the day job (web design), when a link to a blog post made it’s way around the office via AIM. The post was basically one man’s manifesto when it came to creativity. He listed out ten things he wished he knew when he was starting out as a writer and artist. I remember the simplicity of his statements — practical, to the point — but also incredibly insightful. Small things we often forget when we are knee-deep in The Creating or overwhelmed by The Doubts. I remember nodding my head in agreement to nearly everything in that blog post, and then just the other day, while I was at B&N, I saw his book on the shelf. That blog post (by Austin Kleon) has been turned into a lovely little book: Steal Like an Artist. I bought it, took it home, read it in under an hour, and experienced the euphoria I had reading the original blog post all over again. I wanted to jump up and shout, “Yes! This! Exactly this!” This book is a little piece of genius and I think that Every. Single. Person. leading a creative life ought to read it. Or at least flip through a couple pages. Why? Let me give you a sampling. The book opens with a quote from Pablo Picasso –”Art is theft.” — and then goes on to discuss how nothing is truly original. How every idea is simply a re-imagining of previous works. Kleon says: Oh my goodness, yes! Nothing is new. Everything is borrowed and expanded upon. From here, the idea of “stealing” is introduced. And not stealing as in plagiarizing. That is bad. BAD! Plagiarizing is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Kleon instead talks about “copying” as a method of practice, as a way of finding yourself. He talks about surrounding yourself with the work of the artists you love, and the work of the artists those artists love, and studying everything. Embrace those artists. Emulate them. Try to create not only as they create, but to see as they see. Get inside their minds. The goal of copying is to see the ways in which you can’t be those artists because they are them and you are you. Kleon says this much better than me: And then Kleon gives the most basic advice: Start making stuff. Just start! He talks about how “imposter syndrome” often holds people back. (I know for a fact that I struggle with this daily.) So what is “imposter syndrome?” YES! It’s like he’s in my head. I do feel like a phony, a hack, a sad excuse for a writer. I don’t know what I’m doing, and that’s OK. No one does. Every writer face doubts and fears. They sit down and create without knowing the answers — from the NYT Bestselling author, to the child picking up a pencil to draft their very first story. The rest of the book became a sort of surreal reading experience for me, where I felt like Kleon was sitting in my office, speaking directly to me. Everything I need to hear when I’m lost in revisions or slogging through a first draft or swimming in the Vortex of Self-Doubt and Loathing for any number of reasons was in this book. Sometimes these words of encouragement were written: And then there were the doodles — you can see a bunch more — interspersed between all the brilliance: While I’ve summarized the book in this post, it’s nothing like the actual experience of reading it. Between the simple statements, sketched visuals, and conversational tone, it’s almost as if Kleon is speaking directly to you. This book is honest. And beautiful. And real. And it’s just good advice. For a creative life, but for life in general. But of course, as Kleon points out on the very last page: Isn’t that the truth? Originally reviewed ."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I have heard a lot of complaints about this book from all around that it doesn’t actually tell you how to do something, specifically. Really?! What were you expecting? Do you want the author to write you your new novel, grant application, play? Should he wipe your ass too, while he is at it? Get to it. Stop complaining. This isn’t a technical manual or a blueprint for idea. This book does, in my opinion, exactly what it claims to do – no more, no less. Inspirational, a good reminder that the walls we put up around ourselves in the creative domain can be torn down and erected at will. A couple of my favourite quotes:"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I usually don't go for self-help, but this seemed like it would be different. No disappointments here! This is a great book for you creative folk out there. Personally I think everyone can benefit from what this book has to offer."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I don't often go the 1-star route. But this is such a blatant attempt at brand-building that I could feel the ""speaker's fees"" right there between every page. Read Anne Lamott's ""Bird by Bird"" instead for a true creative boost."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Reading this book might be the fastest thing my bosses ever asked me to do. This is a wonderful little book with advice on creativity that makes you think. I'm pretty sure i didn't grasp the whole thing right now. I think i'll take a few things out of it. And in a few months I might read it again (really only takes like 30 minutes) and take a few more things out of it. It's nicely written, it's got some nice napkin-sketches in there so it stays a light read. And it also makes me very curious about the authors poetry book . So aye, he's smart! Ouch. This one kind of hit home. Although i do always plan to read the books i buy (almost) straight away, it just never ends up that way. But it's true though, my library reminds me that the world is full of undiscovered territories and opportunities. I like that! Having bookshelves with only 'read' books would be quite boring, no? I find this actually true. To be effective and productive i often immediately start working on my pc (whatever it is: ideas, presentations...) and at one point i'm typically stuck. I take a piece of paper and i start writing random ideas on there. Drawings things, with lots of arrows. And somehow the ones that went through the random paper process always end up being better, much better. I figure i'll immediately start on paper as of now. See? this one is the best advice of all. And so true. I actually didn't need this book to tell me this, I already know. I never get good ideas when on a deadline or when I'm busy-busy-busy. The best work I do is when i think i'm just fiddling around. And yet somehow my bosses insist on piling work on top of work on top of work. Maybe i should tell to read this book!"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"In an age where even in art there seems to be a focus on the final product or end result, Kleon's manifesto on creativity is refreshing. At a slim 100-something pages, it is a fast engaging read, filled with doodles and quotes and functioning the way zines your internet friend would send you. I say this because it is the equivalent of a whole body approach to creativity as opposed to the spot treatment of fixing one specific area of your art, whatever your medium may be; to put it simply, it's seeing the forest for the trees. Kleon encourages living a creative life in which you make and play while allowing yourself opportunity to work and grow at your own pace. Creativity is less about what you make than the process it took to get you there. You might not even end up making what you intended when you began but you will make something and you will find yourself in the process. Highly recommended for the overly stimulated, easily hopeless creative minds."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This book is all recycled advice and quotes from people who know more than the author. I think the worst advice is on page 19: ""Google everything. I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don't ask a question before you Google it. You'll either find the answer or you'll come up with a better question."" And on the next page: ""Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away. Nothing is more important than an unread library."" Maybe it's just me, but this rubbed me the wrong way. Google is not the answer to everything. This is why kids don't read encyclopedias or dictionaries anymore: laziness. Or according the author, you should collect real reference books just for the bragging rights of owning them. Apparently they aren't worth reading anymore."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"#Booktube_A_Thon_2018 📚6th Book #Steal_like_an_Artist This book is addressed to people who are seeking creativity in their work and their lifestyle, and this magical concept (creativity) is a result of being a wise and intelligent thief!; literally a perfect one who steals thoughts and ideas from several successful folks, random conversations, Tv shows, scientists, inspiring books, and even ordinary people. I really like his style of writing and his motivated thoughts and the drawings as well. Reading this book brought me the same feeling as enjoying a delicious piece of chocolate cake; it is brief, simple, deep and amusing! But what I like the most about this book is its writer's creativity and his boundless imagination, this is the kind of books that breaks the stereotypes and replace them by originative ideas. I took some useful notes instead of rereading the book: 💡You are not bound to create something original because the word original literally doesn't exist ,so free yourself from the burden of being original and embrace influence instead of running from it. 💡Just as you have a familial genealogy , you also have a genealogy of ideas. 💡The books we read and people we are surrounded with and friends we pick determine our vision and the quality of our ideas because we are a mashup of what we opt in our life. 💡Be aware of the ideas you collect and the people you deal with because we will be influenced by them indirectly. 💡Be curious about anything and everything and get your own education don't wait for school to teach you. 💡 Be a genuine nerd, google everything; you may find the answer to your question or you will get a better question. 💡Jot any thought comes to your mind, and copy useful quotes from the books you read and even record overheard conversation! then collect them in a ""swipe file"". 💡Making things paves the way to explore yourself and your capacities but the reverse is incorrect. 💡 Glenn o'Brien said: ""start out as a phony and became real"" thats means pretend you are a successful person until you can achieve it , or fake that you are doing something you want until you can really make it. 💡Observe successful people and start to mimic their style of thinking and doing things, don't just emulate theirs looks from outside but their way of looking at the world. 💡In any field you are intrested in do your work the way you want to see it done . 💡Find a way to bring your body into your work; use your hands intead of just staying in front of your computer; share your hands in the work of your brain. 💡Be an expert of the productive procrastination by doing more than one project at once , move from one to another when you fell broed until you finish them all. 💡Having a hobby is really helpful for your career and your spirit. 💡Share a little glimpse of your process with people. 💡Get rid of social media for a while, isolate yourself from people, pick up a book and enjoy your own company . 💡Be nice to everybody and ignore your enemies to vanquish them. 💡Surround yourself with positive people , and pay attention to the ideas and the quality of thoughts you are influenced by in the social media. 💡Make friendships and be helpful to talented people . 💡Whatever your work is, keeping a file of praise that you heard or read from people who appreciate your work is a wonderful boost when you need the lift. 💡Save your energy and your money as much as you can . 💡You really need a calender to organize your work and a logbook to tackle your progress. 💡Creativity should be restricted or related by limitations or less potentials to be revealed. In the end he adds some suggestions of useful books as Egnore Everybody by Hugh Macleod, Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud and Make a World by Ed Emberley. The book is pretty easy to read and very enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone :)."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Quick read. It is full of what I consider basic, sensible advice for creatives and people looking to practice creativity in their daily lives. Although I would consider the ideas presented merely suggestions because you know what, just do what works for you. There is absolutely no perfect template for creation. Kleon touches on several things like ""imposter syndrome"" that affects a lot of artists, no matter their level. Hehe, hard not to relate! I see it with a lot of my friends too, just the other day one of my favorite, incredibly successful friends was talking about this! We're all just figuring it out as we go along. Imo one of the potential good things about this feeling is it forces you to challenge yourself, to keep trying to evolve beyond where you are and what you are currently creating. Some of the key things he mentions which I try and practice: do anything you can to carve 0ut time to do your creative work. Build a schedule. Maintaining a discipline is important. Do not be afraid to be influenced by artists you admire. Look at and study their work. Even if you start off by imitating, you practice long enough you will generally end up making it your own. That said, always have to be careful not to just blindly copy or follow rote patterns. Although I do think copying is a great practice tool allowing you to reverse-engineer and learn other peoples' problem-solving methods. I do quite a bit of digital work but I also agree with his view on computers. Having a glass screen in front of you is stultifying in certain ways. I always work with physical materials to start projects, the possibilities seem more limitless with those materials. Once the work has gotten to the point of being on the computer the endpoint is more-defined, the work is more tracked, and an element of perfectionism can creep in (partly because it is so easy to constantly erase). This is merely how it works and feels for me, I'm sure it might be different for others. The other book in this vein that I'm planning on reading is Twyla Tharpe's The Creative Habit. Heard it was good, from what I understand one of its main points of emphasis is the discipline required to consistently create."

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This one is short-and-sweet but filled to the brim with good advice. Definitely worth keeping on your bedside table or work desk if you're an artist of any kind (writer, musician, dancer, etc). Probably the piece that stuck out the most for me was Kleon's discussion of constraints. I've known that putting constraints on, say, a piece of writing - putting a box around what I was trying to create - actually made the piece better and, strangely enough, made me feel more free. It was refreshing to hear this bit of advice from someone else. And that's really why this book is great. Kleon takes the things artists know but rarely articulate and he articulates them. Really a book to keep on hand whenever you're feeling stuck."

It's not condoning plagiarism, it suggests sharing of ideas and the process behind the product created by other artists.

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"What a fantastic read. I don't have anything else to add to that. Read it, get inspired and create something'new'."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"You don't have to be creative to read this book. In other words we are all creative, aren't we? According to Austin Kleon, when people give you advice, they're actually talking to themselves in the past. So this book is him talking to a previous version of himself. You can finish this book in less than two hours, but don't do that. Take your own time, if you have read something which you found interesting, ponder over it, one thing may lead to another. For example the writer says that we don't get to pick our family, but we can pick our teachers and we can pick our friends and we can pick the music we listen to and we can pick the movies we see. I wrote this in my note book and tried to analyze it. I felt that we can't get to choose our family or our relatives. It means that we are what we are because of our friends we choose and the most important the books we read. I sometimes think where I would be if it were not for the books I read. That's one habit which has helped me the most. Now I'd like to share some of my favorite quotes from the book: 1.We are shaped and fashioned by what we love. 2.The artists is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference. Hoarder collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. 3.School is one thing. Education is another. The two don't always overlap. Whether you're in school or not, it's always your job to get yourself an education. 4.Fake it till you make it. In Hindi we say, ""nakal karte karte akal aajatee hey."" 5.The best advice is not to write what you know, it's to write what you like. 6.Work that only comes from the head isn't good. Watch a great musician play a show. Watch a great leader give a speech. You'll see what I mean. 7.Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I'm bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts - it's so boring, I always get good ideas. If you're out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall as long as you can. As the artists Maira Kalman says,""Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind. 8. You don't put yourself online only because you have something to say - you can put yourself online to find something to say. The Internet can be more than just resting place to publish your finished ideas - it can also be an incubator for ideas that aren't fully formed, a birthing center for developing work that you haven't started yet. 9.If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room. 10.It takes a lot of energy to be creative. You don't have the energy if you waste it on other stuff. 11. In the end, creativity isn't the just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely. And have fun."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Providing an insight into what it takes to be an artist, this book does more than just going behind the scenes. It gives you an honest and humorous take. It was off to a very strong start, but most of what I read wasn't new. But it was still a great read because of the way he arranged everything. The creativity and effort the author put into this really shows. It's filled with sketches and graphs and doodles and newspaper clippings, making the reading an enjoyable one. Plus, it's barely 150 pages long, and that's exactly how I like my nonfiction, light and funny. A+ for creativity"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Recently, I read an answer given by Vint Cerf to the question “How did Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf create the Internet?” on Quora where he wrote that it was a cumulative effort of generations : ""Of course, our work benefited from the predecessor network: the ARPANET, and the work of many others who invented the transistor, the computer, time-sharing, packet switching, multiple programming languages, and a long list of other things. Things on the scale of the Internet are the product of vast numbers of contributors."" Steal Like an artist echoes this idea. Any great creative work is influenced by some source or the other. The book tells you to go ahead and start making the art instead of waiting for the eureka moment. ""Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started. If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. You’re ready. Start making stuff."" I believe this principle is not limited to artists. After all any work if done passionately, becomes a piece of art to its creator, irrespective of whether it has been done on a drawing board or a breadboard."

If your goal is to be truly creative, you can't just find a book on creativity and follow it to the letter.

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I believe that everybody is an artist. Everyone has a passion deep inside. A whole volcano of creativity, remaining dormant because of adulthood and busy lives. Reading this book may not change the volcano from dormant to active, it depends entirely on the person. But it sure does act as a factor that may lead to it eventually."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This is a quick, funny how-to book that offers artists (the kind who paint, writers, filmmakers, etc.) tips on ""stealing"" other artists' art. Author Austin Kleon points out that no artist's work is ever completely original, and that trying to be completely original will daunt an artist and eventually smother her/his creativity. He suggests artists embrace the inevitability of influence, celebrate living outside of a vacuum, relax, and have fun with their art. Beyond that, he offers tips on how to stay focused, upbeat, and receptive to incoming inspiration. True to its subject, this book features an abundance of quotes and tips from artists who aren't the author. I like that. Instead of this book feeling like one guy talking about what works for him, it seems more like a panel of successful artists sharing their processes (which also happen to work for the one guy). Advice I like in particular: - Every night, before going to sleep, think about one thing that made you happy that day. - Jerry Seinfeld's calendar idea: keep a year-at-a-glance calendar, and every day that you do everything you were supposed to, mark an X on the calendar. See how long you can get a row of Xs."

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Strong 5 out of 10 I was not a big fan of Austin Kleon's previous work, but I tried to come into this one with an open mind. This book was okay... This book was an extremely short read. I read it in around forty-five minutes. It is filled with advice, quotes, illustrations, and newspaper blackout poems. This book had some great advice. I wrote down some of these tips because I think they'd be helpful to practice, but this book has some extreme pacing issues. You'd be reading some great writing advice, and then, two pages of random quotes and newspaper blackout poems shoved right in between a paragraph. I was confused on whether I was to skip the random inserts, finish reading the advice, and then come back to read the inserts, or if I was to read the inserts and then continue onto the advice. But either way, this really broke the immersion for me. The thing with self-help is that it makes you feel productive and inspired reading these books, but then if you don't take and use such advice, it's rather pointless. A lot of these books claim that if you buy said book, you'll do with your life, and , and as well. It's easy to get caught in a loop of buying and consuming these books, whilst it has no effect on your actual life. That's why, oftentimes, I don't rate these books as highly as other people. There are some genuinely good advice and practices in this book. It is annoying to deal with all the inserted material, but overall it was decently enjoyable. Definitely re-readable. This one was okay, but I couldn't recommend his other short self-help books. They were so tedious and repetitive to get through, that I just couldn't bring me to finish them, despite their short lengths."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Some decent snippets throughout, but the majority of this ""gift shop type"" book was filled with things I already think about and do as an artist. I'm feeling now I really didn't need to buy a book with the phrase ""10 things nobody told you about being creative"" on the cover, because I've already told myself nearly all of it. The other parts I didn't really consider were either contradictory of themselves or would in no way relate to how I do things inside my creative process. ""Get really bored"" for example. For real? As a creative type I can't *stand* to get bored. I'm not going to take time from my day to sit down and TRY to become bored in order to get some inspiration; I'm going to go out and look at things. Engage! Kick start my brain; not put it in neutral. And his section of advice called ""Marry Well""? Puh. If we're to a comfortable enough point in life to consider marriage, the partner already knows what it's like to be with a creative person. We (artists) aren't going to go out ""shopping"" for a significant other and stress Kleon's bullets of what they'd be getting themselves into before working out a deal. Congrats to you, Austin Kleon, for finding a wife that will feed you, clean up after you and motivate you. Some of us are busy doing all of that for others while we're still trying to be artists. I also very much dislike how much ""steal"" is stressed in this book, & made to sound normal and perfectly acceptable. I worked in a graphics department once and nearly every designer there stole the foundation for their work from Pinterest. IT DROVE ME UP THE WALL. Use your own mind! There is a difference between being original and mimicking someone else's work. I'm not sure how you can be proud of something-- or even call it your creation-- when it originated from someone else's efforts. Sigh. Please don't pay full price for this book, or even buy it new. Borrow a copy from somewhere and give it straight back."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This book is directed at artists, but really includes general tips for leading a productive life. Anyone can benefit from adopting several of the author’s suggestions. I almost did not read this book due to the title, but it does not encourage plagiarism or literal stealing of others’ intellectual property. Instead, it shows how artists can learn from masters by copying them initially, leading to establishing one’s own body of work. The author recommends gathering ideas you like and turning them into something meaningful to you. It is a little too focused on the online world for my taste. There is nothing particularly new in this advice, but it offers helpful reminders. I liked it and found it worthwhile."

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"The book is a one-sitting read, a simple flip 'n browse through scribbles, notes, lists, drawings and quotes. As my daughter scrambled around her Duplo sets, I read ""Steal Like An Artist"" and took my own notes in another notebook-- and there were some awesome ideas and takeways. Here's one: In your office, keep 2 different desks: one for analog work, one for digital work. Computers are great for editing and publishing, but not for having new ideas. Do you real thinking work at your analog desk, with writing and drawing and scribbling. Here's another: Who is your favourite thinker? Read everything you can from that person, then study that person's three biggest influences. Not a heavy read but an inspiring one, especially for someone who just wants to make more stuff.

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,Short and crisp with some great advice. 👍
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This little book has a misleading name: STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST. With a title like that, I wanted to read a book about stealing ideas to boost your creativity as an artist. The book was a little bit about that, but mostly it was about being organized, managing your money well, and living a happy life. Nothing wrong with that. I liked this book, but there was very little ground-breaking or unusual here. Yes, he's encouraging us to put together various ideas (stolen from others) and package it as your own new and unique thing, and yes, this book is an example of that. But I don't think that the way he put everything together amounted to anything terribly special. Meanwhile, the marketing is pretty good because: I don't often buy random books, but for some reason I spied this at the bookstore and decided to buy it. So I've got to give the author (or maybe his publisher?) credit for that! But I wouldn't recommend others to buy it full price like I did, because all in all, the book is rather ""ho-hum."" But it's still OK! I mean, if you happen upon this book somewhere, it's not going to kill you to read it, and you might come across a few fun quotes or other morsels to enjoy."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"The title intrigued me and I find out it's a super short book so I start reading! I find it so helpful and relatable. I always thought to be original and I've to think everything out of nowhere. And this limitation of 100% originality directs us to frequently click backspace. The author not at all encouraged plagiarism but she asked us to copy and copy as she quote Yohji Yamamoto; “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy, you will find yourself.” This is an excellent piece of advice *_* ‘Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.’ The author told her readers to surround themselves with the best books, talented people and copy our ideals. As she quotes the German writer Goethe “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” “It is our failure to become our perceived ideals that ultimately define us and make us unique.” Did everything come from already present things? Nice :) “What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere.” A unique and out-of-the-box read for me and I like it. Excited to read more of Austin's work!"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Steal Like An Artist explains productive procrastination, a good balance between digital art and hands-on creation, and how to find yourself in your art. There is so much to love about this book. It's funny. It's simple. It's reassuring. Kleon encourages a creative life: to take up some messy hobby not because it's going to make you money and make you famous, but simply to refresh and revitalize your own brain. And I think that fits with the life of a Christian rejoicing in being like our Creator-Father. Best thing about it? I was expecting a fairly short book that would take me a few days to get through--but Kleon's little volume is a 6x6 square of inspirational paragraphs and Sharpie illustrations. You can read it all in a morning. I enjoyed it. And I have it on my list to read again."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I feel like I should go sit in the Naughty Chair by giving it two stars when there are pages of four & five star reviews. It wasn't a bad book, but it was - truthfully - just okay for me. It was mostly zippy fluff and the advice felt a little... calculated. I quite liked this though: ""Write the kind of story you like best - write the story you want to read.

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"This book is directed at artists and everyone who wants to be creative or wishes to add creativity to their lives. This book consists of 10 short chapters each one getting to the straight point and providing inspiration and sound advice that can be applied to our basic lives. The author does not enhearten plagiarism or stealing other people's work but rather he emphasizes that you study several artists at the same time and find your way/style through it. The author also explains productive procrastination and a balance between using old-school ways along with digital ones and the process behind the products created by other artists. This book has lots of quotes from many different people and it has illustrations, little doodles, and bullet points which makes it fun. It’s a quick and easy read which will offer a start and the motivation to take small steps toward being creative. Favorite quotes from the book: “Every new idea is just a mashup or a remix of one or more previous ideas.” “Be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anybody else--that's how you'll get ahead.” “You are, in fact, a mashup of what you.”"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"If you are frustrated with yourself about your artistic commitments or just suffering from a creativity block, this might be the book for you. Concise, profound and creative. This book will feel as nice as a cup of tea during seasonal flu. And the focus here is more on action and inspiration than advice. Essentially half of the book is just pictures and illustrations. But that does not mean it downplays any of the wisdom you should be expecting. And that is why I think that this is a good book for anyone who wants to keep a creative, fun-loving approach in whatever they are doing. (Edit) Quick Update!!! Needed to add some stuff. Since Austin advises writing fan letters or open fan letters in the book, I would like a minute to appreciate his genius and would also request fellow readers to sign up for his weekly newsletters. And I would also like to appreciate esteemed Goodreads Author @Aiman Sabir for the recommendation."

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"A cross between a calendar of famous quotes and a pamphlet of bottled wisdom, Austin Kleon’s “Steal Like An Artist” eulogizes 10 things, despite knowing all of which , you either pretended to be unaware or decided to be intransigent. And in the process, sacrificing your innate creative bent. Comprising all of 133 pages, half of which are compelling illustrations and headline quotes set in font size a wee bit shorter than an advertisement hoarding, “Steal Like An Artist” leaves you feeling ambivalent. The experience is akin to that of a diner whose initial astonishment at the sheer exotic array of options promised to him, is dampened by the subsequent realisation that every single choice is either a translated version of or a cleverly disguised synonym for cabbage. But extremely and ‘cruciferously’ healthy, nonetheless. Kleon’s principles are very simple. “Steal but do not plagiarise.” You can emulate Rembrandt if he is your cup of tea. But please do not reproduce a Rembrandt and pass it off as a ‘rebrand’ (Ok he does not say it in as many words, but you get the message). Better still as Kleon suggests, hang pictures of your inspirations at the place of your work. “They are like friendly ghosts. I can almost feel them pushing me forward as I’m hunched over my guest.” I must have hung my heroes upside down because neither the ghost of Orwell nor the spirit of Hemingway have displayed even a modicum of altruism and wholeheartedness in lending a hand to their worshipper. The one principle which appealed to me and made me sit up is the one involving a mix of both analog and digital tools. Arguing that remaining perpetually hunched over a laptop has drained the modern day man of his creativity, Kleon exhorts us to use our hands whether it be writing or playing an instrument or engaging in craft. I couldn’t agree more. Nothing satisfies me more than scribbling a poem , even if it is absolute balderdash or malarkey using my fountain pen. Yet another dollop of wisdom has to do with the mischief of Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Kleon urges us to “Google everything”. Just to make sure you understand both the Noun and the succeeding pronoun very clearly, he continues: “I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question”. So basically you have a choice of ending up either a Cyberchondriac or a Donald Trump (is there a difference?) and everyone in between. A fantastic piece of advice is to carry a notepad/notebook (not the ones that made Michael Dell and Bill Gates who they are) and a pen wherever you happen to go. When artists such as David Hockney and Arthur Russell can get their clothes tailored in such a manner so as to facilitate stuffing of scrap papers and notepads, what prevents you from doing the same? I have personally been the beneficiary of this practice. I make it a point to always carry a note pad and a pen, both in the hopes that I will meet Salma Hayek one day and get her autograph and (mind you it is not an “or” but a vehement “and”) be so inspired by events unfolding around me that it makes me whip up a masterpiece akin to that penned by Friedreich Hayek! I have scribbled down a plethora of notes while commuting in public conveyances and while waiting to board one too. A curious piece of wisdom involves “marrying well”. Kleon asserts that “it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who’s obsessed with a creative pursuit.” Maybe Roger Federer can confirm this fact. Or would it be Mrs. Federer who would be most well equipped to corroborate this statement? My unmarried status precludes me from either refuting or agreeing with this particular philosophy. Keeping your day job whilst still hustling over the weekends and during times spent away from your day job is a very sensible suggestion. Just so that there is no confusion between livelihood and irrational exuberance, Kleon warns his readers to clearly demarcate between a steady job and creative activities. However one needs to make it clear that the day job needs to be such that it doesn’t want to make you vomit. While on days I have experienced mild bouts of regurgitation, I am yet to reach the retching phase of my profession. Touch wood! Kleon ends his book by giving a list of a few more books to read. Some of his recommendations being, “What is It” by Lynda Barry; “The Gift” by Lewis Hyde; “reality Hunger” by David Shields; “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lamott (I can vouch for this book personally. An absolute masterpiece). Let me end here. I need to take down the uncooperative duo of Messrs. Orwell and Hemingway and replace them with Ms. Virginia Woolf and Mr. J.R.R.Tolkien. May The Force Be With Us All!"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I received the book as a gift, doubting it's depth from the moment I opened it. I am not a fan of gift books with minimal writing and graphics that fill up the pages. This book blew away those doubts. I usually read a book and give it away, but I found myself highlighting quotes to use, recite, and reference. Austin Kleon's Steal Like an Artist just made it to my KEEP shelf of books on writing. It's so simple it's stunning."

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I've been in a reading slump for months now, and as the year ends, I've been making some pretty major life decisions I resigned from my job as an advertising AE, and finally took the jump to pursuing my dream as a creative. I'm scared witless, and I don't know if I have what it takes. I decided to read Kleon's book, and was comforted by the fact that creativity isn't just for the writers and artists, it's for everyone, and I'm sure as hell that it's also for me."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Reflections and lessons learned: “You have to be curious about the world in which you live. Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anyone else - that’s how you’ll get ahead” ‘Where do you get your crazy ideas from’ - is always joked as one of the worst questions to ask entertainers. I’m not in any way artistic (nor an entertainer!) but I’m guessing that there’s a similar one for the artworld, and that it can sometimes be perceived as an attack on originality - are you the one true artist or can people dismiss your genius as blatant influence (“well you’re blatantly copying X from the classic Y genre so how is that even challenging the modern zeitgeist?!”). A book that throws these fears away and instead reminds that you being you and new is still innovative - be creative and inspired as and don’t be afraid! Also any book that quotes Rollins is always something I’m going to look into… Some of the many low level approaches I have taken to have some form of colourful or abstract creativity in my life: a portable printer during lockdown to diarise and decorate the house with easily; posh and trendy sets of coloured pens and pencils; different notebooks and a plethora of types of stationery including pencil pots and cases; iPad pencils (multiple!) for all the potential digital art and scribbles when a pen and paper aren’t close at hand; comedy and cute colouring books; unnecessarily personal detailed book reviews as a way of expressing where the book has taken me to mentally and I’ve felt… On a daily basis I choose to type and write as well as annotate printouts (the analog to digital back to analog loop), colour code, colour in notes, read and switch formats (for instance, as soon as I started reading and enjoying this library ebook version, I immediately bought the audiobook for myself, and looked to buy a print copy for the family!). Whilst easy to sneer at, is fan fiction a bad thing? Being a fan and expressing that through letters (which my father in law confessed to having done so just the week after I read this!). In a complete life metaphor it is about just filling blank space with the correct amount and knowing when to step back and announce that you’re satisfied and finished (often two very different feelings)… for the time being “When I get busy I get stupid…”"
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"3,5 stars “Every artist gets asked the question, “Where do you get your ideas?” The honest artist answers, “I steal them.” A short, easy read that puts creativity into perspective. Not a rationalization to rip-off; just how creativity works. No very deep inspirational messages either; the book has some good advice but a lot of things that were mentioned are actually just common sense. I'd still want to send this book to some people I came across in the internet (You know, the people who are so quick to label a book or a movie as rip off? Yup. Those ones.),though."
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"I picked this up at the school library today while in between parent-teacher conferences. At first, I said to myself, ""self, this is too obvious (just like this joke)."" But forty pages in, when I'd written down 5 quotes and drawn a few diagrams, I realized that sometimes the obvious is exactly what we need. This may not be new ground, but Kleon offers his advice in an entertaining manner, with a liberal dosing of quotes from famous people doled out along the way (my favorite, via Questlove: ""The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from.""). The central premise is that all art is theft, taken from somewhere else and filtered through the unique consciousness of the artist. And I love that I found it so pleasantly packaged, on a table ready for students to grab and devour (as soon as I return it). Too frequently we obsess over the proper citation of sources at the high school level. There is good reason for this. But students must also learn to repackage information in their own way, with their own spin. If I taught a comp or research methods class, I might make this required reading."

Fun useful tip filled read worth checking out ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯
Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Two things! One: Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don't make excuses for not working - make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now. If you have two or three real passions, don't feel like you have to pick and choose between them. Don't discard. Keep all your passions in your life. So, basically, in summary: use whatever you have wherever you are, study the people you admire, get out of your comfort zone to go see the world out there for inspiration, explore all your passions and make 0 excuses about why you can't do the kind of art you want to do.

Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative,"Ah, heck, it was pretty much a hoot and even though I have read many inspirational books in my life, this one is pretty darn good. Quick to read, lively, funny, attractive, and smart. If I'd read it last month, I probably would have ordered copies for every graduate this June. I picked it up and opened it to a quotation that suggested that whatever you do while you are procrastinating doing something else might be what you should be doing all the time. George Eliot wrote while avoiding work on , which became her most admired book in her day. I've read three times, and twice, but have never finished .

The tortured artist, strung out on mescaline or heroin or methamphetamine is an unrealistic and unappealing non-ideal that died about fifty years ago.

We've all stolen from other bright minds who've come before us and reworked their ideas to create our own ""new"" ones.

It's sensible, simple advice for anyone who wants to practice creativity in their daily lives. A lot of things in the book stuck a chord with me, especially the imposter syndrome part.

The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book is a double-edged sword: On one side you have this immediate almost magical improvement in your drawing, on the other hand it's not good for long term improvement. My first drawing after reading just a few chapters, blew my mind away. It was a self-portrait and I could not believe that I had drawn it. After all, it takes months of practice not reading of a few chapters from a book to improve drawing, right? The downside is that you only learn to copy what you see in front of you. You don't learn how to use your drawing medium, nothing much about shadows, no anatomy, no perspective. The focus of the book is on portraits (Which the author rightly says is the hardest thing for artists and the most impressive). But once you're done with this book you must pickup some serious drawing book to improve, otherwise you will be stuck drawing nascent drawings (which you will enjoy neverthless :) ) I will definitely recommend this for those are just starting with their drawing. This book is helluva motivator! You'll see results quickly, but once done, move on!"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I've had several abortive attempts to learn to draw and paint over the last ten years. Part of the problem is that I become frustrated at how difficult it is to draw accurately and in proportion, and invariably put away my pencils and sketchbooks after a series of failures. And then, a year or two later, I try again, with a new how-to-draw book and vigor, only to repeat the process. Recently I unearthed my box of accumulated art supplies and drawing books, and noticed the orange spine of Betty Edwards . This is the most often recommended title for beginners. I recalled reading a bit of it years ago, and setting it aside because the exercises seemed rather complicated and required the use of tools. So, I decided to give it another try. I read it carefully from cover to cover before doing any drawing. Then, I ordered the recommended tools (these can be made inexpensively but I opted to just buy them from the author's website) and have been practicing these exercises ever since. Though much of information Edwards presents in her book isn't unique, the way she teaches it helped facilitate understanding for me in ways I never had before. My entire approach to drawing has changed dramatically and I finally feel like it is something I can eventually master. Edwards believes that drawing accurately is something can be taught, much like driving or learning a new language. Though some people will learn more quickly than others, most people can obtain a basic level of profiency through learning and practice. I don't know why I never thought about it like that before! Artistic talent is often though of as innate, but in reality it is a set of skills. Edwards contends that the only ""talent"" necessary for drawing is the ability to write legibly; if you can do that, you can learn to draw. Much of the beginning of the book sets forth Edwards' theory on neurology and how it affects the way we conceptualize drawing. Though most of this was written decades ago (the book has gone through several editions) and Edwards' theories about brain sided-ness have been disproven, a lot of her framework rings true. By necessity of language, people think symbolically - words represent objects. But, artists think visually and this is what she teaches - how to think and see like an artist. For example, if I were attempting to draw a lamp, Edward would suggest that I stop thinking of it as a lamp. It is a series of basic shapes that are connected to each other in various proportions. So, I would try to see the lamp as a partly a square connected to a cylinder, an oval, etc. By seeing objects as a sum of shapes, a beginning artist can resist the temptation to draw her own concept of what that object should look like. Edwards believes that this tendency to revert to symbolic thinking is what hampers beginning artist. She illustrates this concept brilliantly in a fascinating early chapter about children's drawings, showing how almost universally, children adopt symbols representative of what they wish to draw. Heads are circles, smiles are elongated ""U""s. Once this pattern gets set cognitively, it's difficult to draw a head that isn't a circle. And heads are not circles! Edwards takes the reader through a series of exercises to show how much we tend to draw symbolically. In one exercise, a line drawing of a seated man is flipped upside down and we are instructed to draw it. It forces us to draw visually, as our brain doesn't process upside-down drawings as symbols. I remember drawing the circles of the man's glasses, not even realizing what they were! Most people will draw the upside-down image than the right-side up image. Each subsequent chapter introduces various accuracy skills: sighting, scaling, etc. She employs time honored tools such as picture planes to assist the beginner in seeing their subjects visually. Later chapters address drawing faces and using color. But I am really happy that I re-read this book and dived into its challenges. Thanks to Betty Edwards for teaching so many people that they can learn to draw. Postscript: As a person with a debilitating disabling illness, drawing is a bit of a challenge. I've found ways to work around some of the things that prevented me from trying (again). First, I made a place for my drawing materials where they could be easily accessible, and easily stored away: a nightstand drawer. I draw in a reclined position, with my sketchbook propped up on my knees, so I am comfortable. Some of the exercises require an hour or more of work; these I break up into smaller sessions, and I amend some of the suggested subjects if they are not suitable to my arrangement."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I’ve just finished reading a A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future – essentially a series of book reviews on books the author found interesting and in which he hopes to be able to draw together ideas in those books into a bit of an overarching theory. He wasn’t quite successful, but he did remind me of this book and that has to be a good thing. I read this book about ten years ago at a dark time in my life when I had just separated and moved out from the ex-wife. I had never been any good at drawing and generally hated books that went on about the right brain / left brain distinction – so I’ve no idea why I picked this up. But I did pick it up and almost immediately became fascinated. You see, it diagnosed my problem with drawing in the first couple of pages and then gave me clear and competent instruction into how to make me a better drawer. For years at Primary and High School I had sat in art classes and learnt next to nothing. I wasn’t exactly the naughtiest boy in the class, I would sit and do whatever was asked of me, but all of my ‘art’ was pitifully bad. Like getting a dyslexic to read Shakespeare aloud for the class, there was something cruel in putting a pencil or paint brush into my hand. The problem was no one ever told me that you need to draw what you see – that is, literally what you see, not what you think you see. When we are kids we learn to draw ‘symbols’ of things. We draw triangles for noses and spread out heart shapes for mouths. But these symbols are not what people actually have. People have real eyes and real chins, not a collection of symbols. Just learning that, and that alone, was enough to change the way I drew. The point wasn’t to draw mouths and ears, it was to draw lines and shade and shapes. The other thing this book really taught me was the idea of flow. That being totally engaged in something is about living outside of time. I’m never going to spend enough time drawing to become a good drawer, but this book taught me that becoming a good drawer isn’t something that is genetically beyond me (something I pretty much assumed must have been the case previously). It taught me that the beauty of drawing is in how lost one becomes while drawing – as one does when writing poetry or extended prose. Time melts away. The point of drawing is to melt time, not really to produce great drawings. And this book taught me how to look. It made trips to the art gallery so much more interesting and worthwhile. The drawing exercises in this book should be virtually compulsory in schools. As a child who would, when asked to draw, scribble something tiny in the upper corner of the page – someone afraid of the momentum of lines (something I’m still afraid of) this book was like a light being turned on in a very dark room I had spent a lifetime stumbling around in. For years afterwards I would sit in meetings drawing my left hand. Like I said, Art teachers should be using this book as a matter of course. If you can’t draw a face without blushing, please, read this book – it will show you what the kids at school who could draw worked out on their own and why, without being shown, you never really had a chance of learning."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"My brother is the one who draws and paints, but even for me to do a bit of pencil work, some charcoal work, is the kind of challenge that is good for my thinking, and writing, and how I relate to everything and everyone around me. This is a great book for opening up your life to a different way of seeing ✏️"

The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"1) This book is based on a completely outdated view on neuroscience, the left brain-right brain terminology is nonsensical, 2) This is not a book for people interested in learning how to draw in a classical sense, I recommend lessons in classical drawing by Juliette Aristides for instance, she knows the craft, and knows what she's talking about, 3) The exercises do not teach you how to draw, instead they are meant to teach you how to tap into a creative flow whatever that may be (if Betty Edwards had the answer to that she would be a world famous zillionaire by now), 4) I fail to understand how this book has become so immensely popular, I think it really sucks and does not teach you how to draw..."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I can't believe that I am going to say this, but there is a chance that after reading this book and doing the exercises that I can draw a little bit. I mean, really. My drawings at this stage without too much more practice resemble the album covers of emo-teens with acoustic guitars, but I am certainly doing much better than Napoleon Dynamite. Big time. I think the approach to art that it presents is really intriguing - that we are primarily hammered into left-brain dominance through the acquisition of language - and it is through a reconnection with defamiliarization and the foreign thought process of our childhood that we can shed this brain drain we have lived with for so long since elementary school. I still have a long way to go with this - I find that symbols are constantly at war with my conceptualization of the world (and strangely I am wondering if that takes away the beauty with which we see it, after all, a rose is a rose is a rise, right?) - but this book is certainly a big step in shedding the messed up approaches to visual thinking that I have acquired. As a writer I am at an even bigger disadvantage, but I am on my way. I have learned a great deal more than any other drawing manual I have encountered so far, and it really helps to understand that it is not me - that anyone could be a good illustrator given the correct parameters and education on the visual arts."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Coincidentally, one week before I bought the book at the bookshop, there was a student asking for 5 copies. This is a very popular title that frequently pops up when people ask for recommendation on books that teach drawing. Reviews on Amazon are overwhelmingly positive, which is not a surprise. This book not only teaches you how to think (and not think) when drawing, but also teaches you the techniques to draw. In short, it teaches the approach and the techniques. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain works on the premise that the right side of the brain is more suited for drawing, and teaches you how to engage it for drawing purposes. The different chapters are on contour drawings, negative space, sighting, portrait drawings, colors, light and shadow. At the end is an additional chapter on handwriting art. There are easy step-by-step exercises to follow along. Results will be visible but all the exercises must be done. Perfection requires more practice, of course. The techniques can be easily applied to challenging tasks like drawing foreshortening or a realistic portrait. One thing I noticed on online art forums is, beginners generally like the book. Those who have been drawing for a while say that left & right brain thing is more marketing and drawing is just about focusing. The thing is, this book provides the basic techniques to get people started. And yes, I did read everything and went through the exercises, which aren't really too hard. This book is highly recommended to beginners learning to draw."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I had an art class that used this book as one of the textbooks. It immeadiately changed the way I viewed things. It was one of the pivotal books of my life (I ought to include that as a tag.) When I home-schooled my then suicidal teen daughter and sat her down with this book, she flipped through it for 15 minutes, and started drawing as if she had been taking lessons her whole life. She found a talent she didn't know she had (and several others, but not because of this book.) I highly recommend it for anyone who says ""I can't even draw a stick figure."" This book may change your mind."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I read this book in 1989 and it is amazing. For those with the heart of an artist but none of the talent (like me), it teaches a whole new way to look at and draw things. I remember that I enjoyed many hypnotic mellow hours practicing what I was reading. I also remember that if you concentrate on the the shape of the spaces and shadows instead of the lines of an object, you can draw a pretty accurate picture/portrait."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"My son and I are currently working through this with the accompanying DVD and workbook. I've never drawn from life before (only from two-dimensional photographs), but already a few lessons in, I've been doing so (see images below, which were done in an 8-day period)! Progress is impressively rapid with this method. I've never had more fun with a book! We're using this as a homeschool art curriculum and will continue to use it through the 2012-2013 school year. I think of this main text as the ""teacher text."" It has long but interesting explanations about how the right and left hemispheres of the brain function, and how to access the parts needed to draw what you see. This is overkill for younger students (which is why I recommend the accompanying workbook as a ""student text"" since it gets down to the bare-bones of drawing.) The author divides drawing into 5 basic skills: the perception of edges, the perception of spaces (negative space), the perception of relationships (sighting perspective & proportions), the perception of lights & shadows, and perception of the whole. The DVD will give you a crash course of the book. I highly recommend viewing the entire thing before beginning to draw, as it makes the material in the book so clear and your progress will be rapid. The book will allow you to dig deeper into the concepts briefly presented on the DVD. One of the interesting things about this book is that its principles can be applied to other creative endeavors beyond drawing. I see applications for writers here, too. Here are some of my own drawings so far: Lesson 3 of the DVD: My Hand (perception of edges) Lesson 4 of the DVD: Chair (perception of negative spaces) Lesson 5 of the DVD: ""Doorway"" (perception of relationships) If you want a hassle-free way to get all the drawing materials you'll need for this book, go to the . We love the Portfolio Workshop Kit. See my related review for the workbook that goes along with this main text ."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book's title and content would lead one to believe that it attempts to ride the ""right-brain-left-brain"" car that a lot of pop science publications have been driving for a long time, searching for some fundamental division of human faculties linked to the actual division between the hemispheres of a cerebrum. One's beliefs would be justified, as the book follows the left-right-brain story intently. It's not really the crux of the book, however. From my perception of the book, it is easy and sometimes necessary to separate the scientific motivations behind Edwards' drawing exercises from their rationales and ultimately their results. One enters the book with an explanation for the average person's inability to draw from observation; that is, that drawing for most people is dominated by the symbolic, analytical, linguistic, mathematical chunk of the brain, the studious Left Hemisphere. Hence, the simple barrier to learning to draw from observation is allowing the creative, objective, and somewhat whimsical Right to handle the observation for us. One can benefit from the insights held in this book without the left-right narrative, but the science behind them might, rightly, goad into drawing those who describe themselves as ""not really artsy"". To a high degree, that's just the person the book is largely marketed to: a person with little experience and asymptotically little interest in drawing. That being said, whether you're a hobbyist or someone just beginning their tortuous self-criticising art career, pick up this book, give it a good read, and do the exercises if you think they'll help. Do that, and pay no more heed afterward to this book, for it limits you intently in what it advises you do to draw well. After looking through this book I very quickly turned to Burne Hogarth, Andrew Loomis, and Robert Beverly Hale, authors who focus primarily on figure drawing for illustration. Their instructions rely heavily on exactly what Edwards warns against: drawing figures by relating a system of symbols to one's perception. In the years since reading DRSB, I can safely say the authors listed prior have given me far more tools for drawing well. Edwards' book is a good primer if you want to learn to draw accurately; if you want to draw masterfully and effortlessly, however, your only venue is, in the end, practice."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Frankly, this book's method has all the hallmarks of pseudoscientific snake oil: breathless testimonials on the back, anecdotes in the first chapter, and its own made-up lingo (it's easy to draw when you're in R-mode!). I picked it up because I'd heard lots of good things about it, because I could stand to be a lot more creative, and because I couldn't draw to save my life. It's true that the author is prone to wax poetic about the drawing process; at one point, for instance, she suggests you draw the folds in your palm without looking at your palm, and calls the result a ""beautiful record of consciousness"". However, It's also true that this book made a huge difference in my ability to draw what I see, especially given how little time I was able to spend working through the examples. I've never taken an art-related class in my life so every method was new to me. Just using a few of her recommendations (drawing negative spaces, for example, and trying to keep from naming what you're drawing) produced a shocking difference in how my drawings turned out. One excellent attribute of this book is that you can do most of the exercises with just a paper and pencil. The author recommends that you buy graphite and a special frame and bond paper and all kinds of other things, and I'm sure they're helpful, but in the end what you're doing here is pencil drawings, which everyone has already done in meetings and classes. This book did not make me an amazing artist, but I cannot imagine a more immediately practical and helpful guide for someone who just wants to be able to draw--like, yesterday. 5 stars. My one beef with this book is that it claims to be a handbook for increasing creativity, but the book is really only about one thing: . That means you can draw from still life, or from someone sitting very still for half an hour. With regards to creativity, the author has several markedly defensive paragraphs in which she points out that there are modes for self-expression within the realistic format (for instance, you can use cross-hatching to create a darker area OR follow the contours of the subject!). I was hoping, however, that this book would show me some methods for drawing realistic people and scenes, and at this task it was not very helpful."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"An excellent book for anyone interested in art; most of the focus is on perception and is beneficial for all skill levels. It took me a while to read since I followed all of the exercises, to get anything out of this book I recommend doing the exercises (otherwise I'm not sure any of it would make sense) One could make a strong argument against the ""R-mode"" and ""L-mode"" naming conventions, however, the very proven pedagogical basis is hard to fault. Call it ""accessing your visual cortex"" if you don't like ""R-mode"", but the end result is the same. But still, there were at times too much emphasis on Right vs Left The handwriting section at the end was thoughtful, although a little forced as it seems bad handwriting is a pet-peeve of the author. Despite that, I found treating handwriting as an art to be as fun and engaging as the other exercises."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This is a great introductory course for drawing. It helps new artists to push beyond what they think things should look like to actually seeing what they look like. If you're thinking of starting drawing as a hobby, you can't go wrong with this. There is a short section at the end of the book where the author tries to apply the core skills of drawing to the decision making process in an effort to make drawing skills seem more necessary. I didn't feel that section worked very well."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Great book for beginners and people that ""think"" they can not draw. Whether it's the right side or the left side or your knees that do the thinking, its quite irrelevant and I wish the author didn't put so much stake on the dubious inner workings and preliminary science of the mind. What is useful is the series of exercises that allow students to disconnect from the symbolic and verbal way of thinking when taking a realistic approach to drawing. This goes for painting as well in many aspects. I think the leap in confidence the book allows is remarkable for the immense majority of people that have allowed their logic to interfere with the proper way of seeing and translating what one sees, not merely as things but as shapes. I also liked the author's take on children and preadolescent art. Unlike many psychologists that ascribe convoluted theories to children's drawings, the author looks here for consequences of developing a language of symbols in the formal evolution of art while striving for realism and loosing the natural instinct for composition in the process. This is a great book to start. But once you've mastered the idea and are able to go into the trance, drawing what is in front of you, observing contours and negative shapes and generally looking without thinking , the next phase involves some serious , ahem, left brain activity. A realistic drawing is within reach but now you'll need to move on and make a good drawing. For that, there are plenty of other great books out there that will teach perspective (this book reduces it to a useful but limited extension of the previous techniques of mirroring the sighting), the creation of volume from within the figure, composition, edge and tone manipulation, etc. The power of achieving a qualitative step cannot be understated and therefore I recommend this book and its exercises with no reserves. Just don't get too enamored with which part of the brain is doing the work. I think that sells books but it might not be as useful to you."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I appreciate any of these manuals that don't talk to the reader as if they were already experienced in the drawing practice, this one included because Betty Edwards is just trying to help us see Form - the eternal struggle. There's a cute, little assignment here that I found particularly amusing, the Vase/Face exercise, see , seems to be helping - ever so slightly. I am still furious with whomever it was that first lied to my face that drawing is fun."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This is the book my art teacher used to teach us when I was in my early teens. It's actually got some good ideas in there, with alot of jargon that I didn't understand (and didn't really care to, you don't miss much). Looking back, I appreciate some of the lessons I learned from it. Even if you think you can't draw, give this a chance! Forget that you think all your drawings look like a kid's, and try it, it really was good for me. The main idea seems to be that we draw what we THINK we see, not what we actually see, because our brain interprets it on the way from our eye to our hand. It's so true! We did a lot of drawing from photographs turned upside down, to disguise the subject so that our brain didn't interpret it, and I think that was a good way to train your eye to see the real shapes. Of course, you still turn your picture around from time to time to get a good overview and see if things fit which you might have missed before, but overall the upside down method was useful for me when I was learning. That said, I really really HATED the portraits. Faces are a naturally complex subject to draw, and they are hardest to draw in pencil, and much easier with charcoal. I firmly am of the opinion that learning the anatomical rules to a face - learning to draw each of the parts separately, then how the head is proportioned and where the parts actually go on it (not just where we think they go), then combining the two - is a much better approach. Oh, and I really hated the hand drawings... where you draw your hand without looking at the paper. I understand the point was to train your hand and your eye to go at the same pace, but frankly I don't see anything wrong with looking at your paper and felt it was a dumb exercise every time I did it. Which was alot."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I found an improvement in my drawing after reading this book and doing the exercises. If nothing else, the idea that drawing is not a matter of manual dexterity (according to Edwards if can write decently, you can draw), it is a matter of how you look at objects and interpret it on paper was a boon. It made me stop thinking that I couldn't draw, and I couldn't learn to draw. I mean you must be able to learn to draw; think back to the days when an ""accomplished"" lady had to be able to speak Italian and do watercolors! Edwards uses a lot of jargon about the sides of the brain and modes, but basically the book boils down to the following: Instead of actually drawing what we really see, most of us try to draw symbols of what we see. It is really amazing--try it. Really examine objects and try to represent them on paper. I found that when I let my attention wander I would draw a line slanting the wrong way or the wrong length because I unconsciously slipped back into the mode of drawing what I thought the object looked like--not what it really looked like.[return][return]My biggest gripe about Edwards is her before and after portraits. Don't feel discouraged about them. In her seminars she has students use one method of drawing for the before and another method using charcoals for the after. Faces are hard anyway, and the charcoal makes it easier."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I’m still going through this book so I will write up a more complete review in time but I will comment on what I think of it so far. Betty Edwards seems to express herself quite well in the way she teaches and the methods she uses to bring an absolute beginner from nothing to actually having a chance at art. She focuses so much on activating the creative side of the brain, or the right side of the brain. In order to do that, she teaches you how to train your eyes to see properly and then drawing exactly what you see and not what you think you see. The text in this book is well worth the read so if you are thinking of buying this book, make sure you are willing to sit down and just read and read. It’s truly rich in its content. The book also includes exercises you should do in order to advance from being a simple beginner in art. If you feel like drawing just doesn’t seem to be working out for you and are considering buying a book to help, this is definitely it. I highly recommend it. Check out more reviews at"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"A couple of observations about the book: - I think it can be a good book for beginners, however, it lacks a lot of important information about drawing. - I don't know if the focus of the book was only to silent the L-hemisphere of the brain or to teach us how to draw. I sense it was more to say that L-hemisphere is not artistry and R-hemisphere is. - The last two chapters of the book I sensed was more about the Author's own opinions about the way she can use the tools rather than actual facts. One can have theories and create a lot of opinions on how to fit them into reality but do that really work? - A lot of self-theories but not real facts. I sense a deep explanation of her beliefs but zero proof for it. When it comes to things like explaining scientific concepts like the brain. Where are the graphics, documents, pictures? I understand there isn't the ""perfect"" book of art and I learned a few things reading this book. I followed all her drawing instructions but at the end... things like shadow/light are lacking explanation."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"As we start our homeschooling journey I am often looking to the future for possible choices for curriculum and resources. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is definitely a resource I plan to keep around. Art is something that has always escaped me. I remember in elementary school there was a teacher who walked around to different classrooms with a cart teaching art, but that is all I remember. I do not remember any of our classes or really learning anything in that situation. I remember doing kits from a hobby store and learning different things that way, but the only one that stuck with me was cross stitch and later in my married life quilting. In first grade I won first price for a coloring contest, drawing and coloring, but that was just me having fun. I never learned any real skills. There was one summer, I think it must have still been in my elementary school years, where I took all sorts of classes on pottery and drawing and other things in artistic pursuit. I loved it, but nothing ever went any further. My schools did not have art classes after that, until I entered high school, but those classes were all advanced and for people that had been involved in art their whole lives so it was too late to get started. Now, a decade later I'm shown that it is not too late and that I indeed can learn to draw. That's fascinating! I have an advanced reader copy edition so I cannot promise that the final press print would appear like this. In my edition they are all black and white and some are quite dim and hard to see. But the real treasure in this book is not just in the images and examples but in the text. Reading through this book the student has a great teacher that cares about the skill of learning to draw. Yet there is more in psychology and neuroscience mentioned as well as teaching direction to draw. It is not surprising after reading through Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain that this is ""the world's most widely used drawing instruction book"". I agree that this book is written for all in the professional, academic and even hobbyist frame of mind. *Thanks to Tarcher/Penguin for providing an ARC for review.* posted:"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I actually picked this up because of the title, yeah I was deeply focused and involved in the basics of drawing in those days and sometimes still am, so I thought this would be an interesting read? As it turns out I was right and glad I bought it too, it is amazing! Betty wrote it very clear, concise and simple to understand especially for the beginner in mind. I like the fun little exercises inside too. And you know what? They really work! Know keep in mind I was just a beginner then and when I would finish an exercise and find out to my surprise that I had actually had done a good job I was excited as every novice is probably. Sometimes I go to my shelf and pull it for old times sake. I think this book is timeless, it should be read by anyone deciding to begin a life as an Artist. Of course I gave it 5 stars... It's one of the very first books I've read that got me started and on my way."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This is a pile of crap. If you want your drawings to look nice learn anatomy, composition, and perspective. Not a book with some pointless silly exercises."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Drawing is a skill that feels like magic to some. It involves creating something out of nothing, after all. With simple strokes on paper, we can trick our brains into believing there is something more than just lines. It's truly powerful stuff when you think about it, but then why is it so hard to just copy what you see? is a guide aimed at those who think they will never be able to master this particular craft. Through practical exercises and insights, Betty Edwards teaches readers to enhance their drawing skills by tapping into the brain's right hemisphere, which is responsible for creativity and visual perception. One of the things that makes drawing from life so difficult is that our brain likes to play tricks on us. In most circumstances, this makes life much easier: our mind basically fills in the blanks, and we perceive things more wholly than we do. When it comes to drawing, logic and rationality can suddenly become a hinderance: we simply won't believe that one chair leg appears shorter than the other because we that they are all the same. What this book teaches is how to overcome those blockades. As an illustrator, drawing is literally my job, so I might not be the target audience for this, yet I had great fun exploring this very conscious way of approaching something that has long become second nature to me. I did all the exercises and was surprised by the results. By changing up little things, recreating what's in front of you suddenly becomes easy and accessible. I also enjoyed how Edwards conveyed the idea of drawing being more than just creating art, but instead being a fundamental way of understanding our world. By engaging with it in this way, we perceive reality more accurately and foster creative thinking. I think this is a great read for anyone who has stopped drawing as an adult, thinking that they are just no good at it. It's an unintimidating and approachable introduction to the subject!"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"If you’re an absolute beginner for drawing, this book is definitely for you. If you have been wanting to draw since childhood, but never managed to draw properly or scared of picking up drawing, please give this book a try. I can draw decently. I have done some good realistic sketches. But I didn’t know what to do next to improve my skills. This book helped me a lot in that journey. I didn’t really believe in all the pseudoscientific information she gave about brain workings. But her points about how to see and draw were really helpful. If you’re going to read this book, I highly recommend you to do all the exercises without skipping any. Don’t skip the viewfinder and picture plane. Use an old rectangular photo frame as your viewfinder/picture plane. I used a 2B pencil, regular eraser, sharpener , regular paper and a photo frame to do all the exercises. Don’t let the lack of supplies stop you. I can’t stress enough: do the exercises from each chapter before moving on to the next chapter. Cons: I felt like the chapter about shades was very weak. The book mainly focuses on portraits. Author said that portraits are intimidating, so doing them well will boost our confidence. That’s true. But I guess we can succeed only when we keep practicing and transfer the skills that we learned in this book to other areas of drawing."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Regardless if you want to be an artist or not, this book is kind of an interesting read. It delves into the mysteries of the mind. It explores all the roadblocks that the pesky left brain builds to keep us from being the next Leonardo da Vinci. This is actually the book form of a live, instructional course taught by the writer. So there are mental exercises that are used to strengthen the right brain and force the left brain into the background. This is both a positive and negative. It’s positive in the fact that there is some instruction that leads you along a path. Some other art books tend to speak of ‘ideas’ but don’t really tell you how to achieve an idea. The negative is that it becomes slightly tedious to read. Almost like programming a VCR. Do people still do that? How about putting together a kid’s toy? Anyways, once you do the exercise a few times, you’ll have the method memorized. Do they actually help? Yes, I believe so. It tells you why you can’t draw and describes an exercise to get over a particular shortcoming. I think ‘natural’ artists tend to see the world differently and this book, if you put in a lot of time, will help you see the world that way. Is it a quick fix? No, you will have to spend months doing the exercises over and over. If you don’t want to draw, the book is still interesting as it explains a few facts about the human mind. Explaining why people tend to fear drawing once they get older. Why it is so hard to draw in perspective. Also how the two sides of the brain interact and how the left brain is a bully.

The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"The reviewers are right. This is a wonderful book in teaching you how to see, and then how to draw. Essentially, to be able to draw is not about the skill of the hand but the ability of the eye to see. The exercises help you learn to see: 1)edges (contours) 2)negative space 3)perspective and proportion and using a basic unit as measurement 4)light and shadow 5)wholeness I think it is important to do all the exercises as it did give me a little more confidence. These are 5 essential skills, and as we move along to learn about colours and the use of other mediums, we still need these 5 skills. The last 2 skills (not taught in the book but mentioned) in art is drawing from memory and from imagination. But these need to be built on the first five. I am very glad to have read this book, as there are many drawing books in the market and from what I see, many are not very useful because they teach techniques but not how to see."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,This is probably the best book you could read to improve your skills at drawing. The key being that this book teaches you how to 'see'. In order to draw with accuracy it is necessary to let go of your preconceived notions about what things 'should' look like and using symbols to represent features rather than observing what is actually there. This book is an amazing tool for learning how to work with your own brain and become really observant and powerful artistically. I have seen it make a huge impact on my art and that of others I know. I also noted when I first read this book that my first art teacher in school used some of the early assignments to teach us to draw.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"If you're looking to improve your drawing skills and unlock your artistic potential, Betty Edward's ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" is a great place to start. This book helped me discover the joy of drawing realistically, especially capturing portraits. When I was a young teenager, this book resonated deeply with me. I remember doing the exercises in it from cover to cover. I grew in my mastery of drawing, and in expertise at capturing a likeness on paper. I was also able to use the book as a jumping-off point in teaching my own art students. While the book doesn't encompass everything—layout, composition, color theory, abstraction, etc—its core message of mastering draftsmanship is invaluable. And this is the book that helped a generation of artists put a name to that relaxed place that your brain goes when you’re drawing——the right side! ~Jen"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book was very helpful to me when I began to really draw. Betty convinces you that you can draw no matter what... maybe part of it is that placebo effect but that never worked for me before :P Anyways she has alot of good information in the book, she also has some exercises I found helpful in forcing your mind to study a image and each part of it in concordance with other parts to attempt to more accurately depict your drawing. In other words it helps your image stay as close in proportions to the original as possible. Unbelievably to me it worked the first time, I mean my drawing was no where near perfect but it was much better in proportion than any previous drawing I had ever done. I was quite surprised. While this information is helpful and the book will certainly make you a better artist there is nothing like practice. Unless you practice alot you will go nowhere so keep that in mind :)"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I was impressed at first by the book, and I certainly have seen some improvement in my drawing but I think that after I read some critical reviews of the author and how ""it is just copying"" I became discouraged and became to find fault with the book. I don't disregard it because I have seen myself draw a few things that I never thought I could manage. However, when I'm not doing the specific exercises my drawing is no where near the quality of what the book claimed I should see. I suppose though the idea is to take what I have managed to learn and add new skills from other artists. But, I still don't feel that I actually can draw."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I am glad I read the book and would recommend it to anyone like me. I started pencil drawing about three months ago and have never had any drawing instruction previously. After spending about three weeks with this book, practicing for about 2-3 hours a day, I am now at a skill level where I feel comfortable (dare I say proud) to show my drawings to my friends. I am no longer afraid (out of embarrassment) to sign up for classes with the Art Students' League!"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"A great how-to guide, with interesting undertones of art therapy. Highly recommended."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Very helpful and informative. Really helped me approach drawing. Something I always wanted to try, but was afraid I was no good at. This book was a gift from my more artistic daughter, and she was very thoughtful to give it to me. Following the author's exercises, really helped me learn how to approach drawing. I won't say I'm great at it, but I do enjoy what I can do. As my daughter told me, you have to practice to get better. The author's approach was quite doable. Thumbs up!"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book was recommended to me by an art teacher. Yes, I was fascinated by art, love photography and crafts. But felt I was unable to competently draw. I had given up even trying to draw, even though I had enjoyed art and drawing as a child. I love the realization that everyone, even you and me, has the ability and talent to draw - to be artistic. This book will help you to connect with this side of yourself that is often dormant or hidden. This is a wonderful journey into the brain! Read the book, work through the exercises and be patient with yourself while knowing you can do it too! Great learning moments about how you perceive yourself and the world around you. I am grateful for be able to apply these lessons to other parts of my life too. Be amazed at your real potential !"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I had been very skeptic about this book's content and the topic of the functions of right and left side brain. I am still for the matter. What I want to say about the book that is completely amazing, how the technics in it are helping to achieve me to be a better drawer and thinker. (I am still reading at the moment.) I am always occupied how we can change our thinking habits and make it more usable. I am not the kind who thinks in the law that we are ""made at birth"". That isn't the why we aren't able to sing, draw, or capable for doing things which are told that is impossible."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,Love this book which gave me back the joy of drawing! I joined 3 art classes where our teacher used this book. I stopped drawing when I was 12 because I wasn't good at all. Now 40 years later after the first few classes and a lot of practice everyone including myself are very pleased with what I draw. I is so wonderful and it's giving you peace of mind only focused on one thing: the drawing infront of you.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I finished this forever ago, I don't know why I never wrote a review of it. Anyway it works. It does the trick. You will learn how to do representational drawing using this neat little self hyponsis trick. If you think you cannot do realistic drawing, you are incorrect. Anyone can do it really. But porting this skill onto drawing from memory or modeling shapes which don't actually exist in front of you... that is a completely separate task."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,this book can bring out the artist in anyone! I thought I couldn't draw a straight line and started the exercises in this book and was amazed at myself. my confidence grew as my drawing improved. this will never be more than a hobby for me but now it is a more rewarding hobby!
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"If you want to learn how to draw, regardless of the style, realistic or cartoon, anime or superhero comic, even abstract, this is the book you should read first. These are the foundation principles that all forms of drawing and painting share. Don't go to art college - save yourself a life of student dept, and just read this instead. Other recommendations for aspiring artists/illustrators 'Ultralearning' by Scott Young Colour theory in a nutshell: 'In English, the word left comes from the Anglo-Saxon lyft, meaning “weak” or “worthless.” The left hand of most right-handed people is in fact weaker than the right, but the original word also implied lack of moral strength. ...the Anglo-Saxon word for right, reht (or riht), meant “straight” or “just.” From reht and its Latin cognate, rectus, we derived our words “correct” and “rectitude.”'"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Outstanding book on How-To-Draw as well as the Neuroscience regarding Right versus Left Brain Modes of perception and action. Well-written with many examples and pertinent figures. I Loved the before and after drawings of Art Students, done just 3 days apart with a remarkable improvement. There were many drawings of professional artists as well as drawings by Edwards and her fellow teachers. I loved the explanation (and it made so much sense) why most Art Teachers are so shitty at actually teaching students how to draw. Every art class I have taken started with a long list of very costly materials which I then had to go out and buy on a very limited budget--and then the ""teaching"" consisted of using the materials like ink or charcoal, making a huge mess with them and creating something no one (least of all me) wanted to look at, and the course ended with the expensive materials being stashed away to dessicate never to be used again. One beginning art class project consisted of creating ""art"" by cutting up the comics pages in newspapers and pasting them into an abstract collage. [The Art Teacher was so impressed by my newsprint project result they showed it to other classes as a shining example--which was mildly gratifying but not really. All I wanted was to LEARN HOW TO DRAW--or at least improve.] My least favorite word (in regards to Art) is Multimedia--this guarantees I am going to hate the finished product. Betty Edwards explains why drawing is so hard to teach, discusses the barriers to learning how to draw, and gives step by step exercises to teach the skills to oneself and students. There is an emphasis on drawing human faces. I loved learning about proportions of faces and doing so, I was able ""see"" better than I ever have before. I will confess that I did not do all the exercises--but I did many of the ones that didn't require buying any materials, I plan to do a few others from this book, and have seen my drawing skill improve. These techniques are perfect to build on. Edwards' advice is spot on and she seems like a wonderful person based on how she writes about teaching and learning. Highly recommend this book to: anyone with an interest in How To Draw, Art appreciation, or Teaching Art."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I read the book a while ago, but I read it at least twice and I did almost all the exercises. I have been drawing since I was a kid, and in this context, I could see that a lot of what she was explaining I already kind of did it in an intuitive way. It was actually very interesting from that point of view, because I could see how someone who has always thought that they just don't have the talent to draw could really find this book useful, because it teaches you basic aspects of how to see reality in a way that, at the very least, you can copy it way more accurately. The method that she proposes, at least the one that I remember the most, of converting ·3D objects in 2D in your mind so you can see the proportions and distances more clearly it was interesting. Having said that, It wasn't really that useful for me, it was more like an interesting exercise and explanation. But I could also see the not so good part of the book, which is that in a way it can reinforce a tendency (that I already had) to ""flatten"" the way you see objects and reality and thus not making easier certain important processes that an artist has to learn, like being able to construct objects in perspective in your mind to be able to draw them from any angle. Basically, it's a book that it's better for people that think that they can't draw, and in any case, an interesting read, although I don't completely like her approach that she takes."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"It took me a while to ""finish"" it as I intended to participate in the exercises given by Betty in the book. It has been one of the most helpful books on drawing I've ever read and clearly deserves a 5-star rating just for that. You can see your own progress during the drawings and each chapter a new layer of depth is added to your repertoire. Most books don't explain basic concepts of drawing very well. I'd say start here and never look back. Simply marvellous."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Read multiple times. My hippy, artist MiL gave me this book when I taught art...back in the day before I had kids and had just met her son ;) I’ve used this method with children (and adults)...it’s a great tool to teach beginning artists. The core tenets can be expanded on with most teaching styles. My favorite application is the self portrait method for children and teens. They’re always impressed by their finished artwork."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"An outdated drawing book from the 20th century. The neuroscience knowledge is largely trashy false science (maybe they thought that it's true in the last century). And what's horrible is that there are many stereotypes about learning that is absolutely a taboo at this minute (e.g. female is feminine, male is masculine, language means anaytical while visual means emotional, etc). But the basic drawing techniques is still timely. Highly not recommended."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"So, my lockdown hobby of choice ended up being drawing. As a kid I loved it but haven't drawn a thing in years (though always liked the idea of ""being able to draw""). Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a highly recommended and insanely popular book on learning to draw. And I can see why, as it's power to motivate and get you drawing is immense. The book starts by asking you to sketch a few pre-instruction drawings. This includes a self-portrait, a drawing of your hand, and a drawing of the corner of your room. The book is genius in that it does this so you have a baseline and can compare your later improved drawings to these earlier attempts. This contrast between caveman level inscription and reasonably recognisable drawing with some semblance of shape and form is Betty Edwards way of visually showing your progress as you work through the chapters. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain starts with a focus on edges and negative space, then moves onto proportions and perspective, before looking at things like shading, composition, and hatching. But through each chapter of drawing tutorial, the book is teaching the most fundamental art skill on earth, the art of truly seeing. The book dives into the key concept of seeing exactly what is in front of you rather than what your brain is perceiving it to be, and by doing this it teaches that drawing from life or reference is nothing more than putting down exactly what you see. By completely changing the way you perceive and think during the drawing process, even simple sketching becomes remarkably entertaining (and the results also show an immediately clear improvement). The structure of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the key to its success. By taking you through each section and building on each previous lesson/skill, the book gradually expands the way you think as you draw, while improving basic drawing skills too. The steady progression and mix of simple exercises to more rewarding pieces always feels fulfilling, making this one of the most positively inspiring books to follow through with. The science behind the whole right brain/left brain thing may be complete junk (or at best inconclusive), yet even as a metaphor rather than scientific fact, it still applies very well. And while the science itself is not touched on much here, some chapters going into topics like the way drawings change and adapt in children as they age prove to be fascinating. My one criticism is that while there's plenty more reading needed to build on the starter skills taught here, this book gives very little guidance on where to go next, or how best to maintain the progress made here. This book took me from being someone who ""would love to be able to draw"" to someone who draws, and that alone pretty much says it all. 5 left-sided stars."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I always struggled with drawing from life, i hated every assignment i got involving still life drawings and my teachers never really taught me the correct skills to improve. Naturally i enjoyed using photographs to draw from and used projectors for large paintings. I thought it would be a good idea to use art books to try to improve this skill myself, since i noticed i wasn’t really growing it in art school. I could’ve never imagined how much i improved from this book in only a week to 2 weeks time? It is insane. I couldn’t believe my eyes when i compared my self portrait before and after reading this book and doing the drawing assignments in it. I swear this book isn’t only great for people who have never really drawn before, it is great for people who want to improve drawing from life as well. Even tho it goes through the basics and most of it you’ve probably already seen if you’ve ever been to art school, like shadows, hatching and perspectives but i swear it will give you new knowledge no school has ever taught you. This has changed my way of drawing forever and i’m incredibly grateful i stumbled across this book when i did."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Reading this book has profoundly changed my instructional practices. Since I had started reading the book at the end of last year, it gave me some observational data on how some of the techniques could change the classroom culture and art making practices. This year, I implemented the warm up techniques at the beginning of the year, students drew specific things in their sketchbooks as bell work and now all of my classes are able to get focused and in the 'zone' pretty much every day when we utilize the strategies. Students' drawing skills and my ability to explain certain things have improved as a result of reading this book. Explaining to students the science behind how their brains respond to certain activities helped them to understand how art can help them focus and what they need to do in order to prepare their brains for artmaking, which has helped with goal setting and overall productivity."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Phew! It ends. At last. This is one of those books that lied idle on my shelf for so long. I am glad that I finished it at last. If you have never laid a pencil on paper to make anything other than regular handwriting, then this book is for you. This is a decent read for absolute beginners in the world of art, especially drawing. I wouldn't suggest this to people who already know how to draw and paint. The author makes reading a little tedious with her going on and on about the brain hemispheres. Pick it if you must."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Want to become a better artist & draw like never before? This is the book for you. Want to understand a little bit of the the psychology and biology of human spatial awareness? Then, again, this book is for you. I liked every chapter - every insight is worth committing to memory and the drawing principles are all worth applying. While reading you should experiment with the techniques presented - you'll become amazed at what you can accomplish. I thoroughly enjoyed `Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain`."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Before I read this book, if someone came up to me and said: “Anybody can draw” - I wouldn’t have believed it. Now I do. It is fascinating to learn the intertwined relationship between different modes our brain operates and how drawing lets you explore it as much as language does on other mode. Just as one can learn how to read and be able to read anything in their life, learning the fundamentals components of drawing elevates your visual perception at a whole new level!"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I used to love drawing as a teenager, but felt like I was starting from zero picking up the skill as an adult. I completed all the exercises in this book and I think it gave me a great foundation to build from. I appreciated how everything was broken down into step-by-step digestible skills. Why 4 stars then? Firstly I’m quite skeptical of the pop science interpretation of lateralization in brain function (“left” and “right”), but it’s a reasonable frame for discussion. Secondly the book never adequately teaches you how to draw on toned paper, and my unguided attempts were quite frustrating."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I'd tried several times to read through Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain on my own. Once my Beginning Drawing teacher demonstrated exercises from the book, I finally understood Betty Edward's approach. I didn't agree with all of her left brain / right brain theories, but her general approach to ""draw what you see"" makes sense. I also appreciated her suggestions for left-handers."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"THE quintessential book for learning to draw. This is a must read if you want to learn the art of drawing. There's a moment where it all ""clicks"" and your entire outlook is changed. You realize that you can do it and it's an awesome moment to have. I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in drawing. 10/10"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"A classic. It's always a pleasure to re-read this book. The main concept (draw what you see and stop relying on your mental symbol library) can be found in many newer books, but it's definitely still worth reading."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"There's a reason I recommend this book to every student (or non-student) who says they can't draw or they wished they could draw. If you read this book AND do the exercises, your skills will improve."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I highly recommend for anyone who wants to draw, no matter their current skill level. I unlocked new powers in my brain, and am amazed at my progress after completing this book."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,Recommended by a friend who is taking drawing classes and was assigned this as a required reading. I think it has a lot of good tips and is very helpful in explaining how you can improve proportions and scaling. I’ve always enjoyed drawing and look forward to *hopefully* having more time soon for it.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,This book taught me how to draw and have confidence in art. I still hands a long way to go in art but it was a wonderful book to work through.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,It's a good story not what I expected but it's nice and entertaining
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,The updated version has more content. Yet if you do attempt each exercise and go at a slow pace. You learn alot. Definitely a good foundation book.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Stop thinking about it so much like why are u reading about drawing just go draw. also the entire narrative of ""this is how you draw like a smart person"" is so annoying. never liked this book"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Really enjoyed this - I’m not in a place right now where I could invest a significant amount of time drawing and practicing, so I’m looking forward to purchasing this book in the future (so I’m not at the mercy of the library 😆)."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I think this is an excellent book because it tells you all the basics a beginner artist needs, however for me since these topics were reviewed (which was great) also got me bored. There are many hands-on exercises to go along with the book as well, which added heavily to the time it took me to read it. This book would be great for art teachers. NOTABLE POINTS: ✏️ 5 basic skills of drawing consist of the perception of: edges, spaces, relationships, light/shadows, and gestalt (or the while). ✏️ additional skill consist of drawing from memory ✏️ Negative space drawings, drawing with your reference upside down to only focus on spaces and values, Gesture/contour drawing"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"you get your money worth out of this book, all though i did found it a little bit lackluster at some points, but that was to be expected, you can't get a feedback out of a book it's a one sided conversation, but over all it gives you a structure to follow and i am happy with my results, and all the techniques i have learned, one other thing about it is that you feel welcomed reading this book you never feel lost or left behind, it's always encouraging you to practice more and to be patient;"

The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Ohh this book. No wonder the college drawing class that required this book frustrated so many of its students as much as it taught them. Having re-read this book in its entirety, I have to say that it's a wonder any of us continued to draw after graduating that class. If you can ever get past the horrendously warped theology and the interesting, but ultimately aimless ramble through neuroscience, there’s a fairly decent introduction to some useful drawing skills in the final few chapters of this book. But getting there is such a chore... Betty Edwards has a lot of good techniques to teach beginners (eventually), but her assumption that we must achieve an altered state of consciousness and “shut down” one half of our minds in order to draw effectively is ludicrous at best—dangerous at worst. The author treats the left hemisphere of the brain as if it’s the villain of a story, and proceeds for chapter upon chapter of theory-crafting in order to convince us of its villainy and teach her readers to silence all thought and perception provided by said hemisphere in order to achieve a perfect state of mind in which to “really see”—thereby intentionally causing frustration, confusion, and a reliance on this trance-like state in order to ever draw. (You might think I’m stretching that a bit and being too harsh, but I’m not. The author herself admits as much multiple times right there in the text.) If you can wade past all of that, however, the actual drawing instructions in chapters 6-11 are quite well written and educational. Mercifully, this section of the book is relatively free of the author’s meandering theories. In the back half of the book you’ll find wonderfully simple-to-comprehend lessons on perspective, sighting, portraiture, foreshortening, negative space, shading, and a short lesson on colour theory. Things that are when learning to improve your drawing skills. If you’re interested in studies about the brain, I highly recommend reading the first few chapters (with a grain of salt, of course, and understanding that the actual scientific research she references has likely advanced beyond the contents of those chapters in recent years). But if you simply want to learn to draw, I recommend at most skimming the first few chapters—avoiding like the plague the exercises on achieving an altered-state of consciousness (shifting from the so-called “L-mode” to “R-mode”)—and starting with a more thorough reading and working through the drawing exercises beginning in chapter six. Learn the techniques for measuring and sighting, for observing lights, shadows, shapes, and spaces, and let the rest of it go. No trance necessary."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"DNF. I'm a novice artist. I had heard alot about this book so thought Id give it a read. Firstly, it's filled long winded psychobabble. The whole left and right side of the brain fighting for tasks is outdated. She talks about this alot, when really I only wanted to get to the exercices. But the exercises felt somewhat pointless. One exercise, drawing upside down, I did fine with this, but not, I think because it was upside that but because I'm not a complete beginner. A couple of years ago I had tried this upside down drawing and hated it. It was terrible and I hated the assumption that it would be good. Betty does the same. After each exercice she tells you that she's sure you will be pleased. For those who aren't, I think this will be frustrating to read. I found the blind drawing exercise, strange and not something I'll do again. I don't see it teaching me to pay more attention to what i actually see. In fact I think it would make me pay less attention, because there are no real results. Betty neglects to inform her readers that drawing takes practice and repetition. You will likely have to do a task multiple times before you improve. I do find the viewfinder and plastic sheet a good explanation for how to draw what you see for beginners. I didn't try it as I didnt have materials but I can see that clicking for beginners. I quit the book shortly after this. Tired with her waffle. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do decide to give it a try these are the materials you need. -Clear plastic, about 8x10"" and 1/16 thick -two ""viewfinders"" made of black card-board, about 8x10 -non-permanent black felt-tip marker -graphite stick #4B -masking tape -eraser -two bidner clips"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Her ideas on the lateralisation of the brain are WRONG. In the 1950s Roger Sperry studied split brain patients, mostly epileptics whose corpus callosum had been cut. That research has been out of date since 1970. Unless you're a split brain patient, you do not do types of activities such as drawing with only 1 side of your brain. You use all of your brain. Except for handedness, lateralisation is very minor. She would have been more accurate if she had said paint in a creative mode, not an analytical mode. Something along the lines of paint like you’re feeling the subject. Don't paint like a engineer. Don't tell yourself ""I’m painting an eye. That's an eye. Make it look like an eye."" Instead, observe the eye. Paint the light . Paint what you see, not what you tell yourself you see based on preconceive notions of what you think you remember an eye looks like. The main point is to learn to see. Her science is wrong, but the idea that you need to stop being over analytical and logicical is right.. Despite her lack of understanding of science, the book helped me improve my drawing and painting skills."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Not going to lie... this book is awful! It forces you to loose all of your natural style and original artistic talent to learn to draw just like everyone else. This book was used in my college Drawing I class and it was honestly awful. I literally burned my copy of it so no one else would read it. I'm not saying it can't help you, maybe if you have no drawing skills whatsoever... but for me it really messed me up and set me back when I thought that I already had some natural ability. There is something to be said about getting to that Right side of your brain/ zoning out, but it can't be forced. It has to just happen naturally. I would never leave such a negative comment normally, but this book literally had a negative impact on my life and my art."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"The science in this book is obviously no longer exactly new and groundbreaking, and presumably it's wellllll out of date. But the theory is mostly something you can casually consider in broad terms while still trying to change the way you approach and think about drawing, and I think that's a fairly useful framework for trying things a different way. It was helpful to a point for me, and included some exercises I had done before in art classes but that are perennially useful to play with, like blind contour drawing and drawing what you literally see instead of what you imagine a thing to look like. It didn't unlock the secrets of drawing for me, but it did lead to some helpful experiments and a few things I will take with me as I try to not be tragically terrible at drawing."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This new edition of the hugely popular and influential drawing manual, first published over thirty years ago, incorporates new findings from neuroscience, like the discovery of brain plasticity, together with the tried and true exercises included in past editions. The author explains the value of accessing the brain’s more creative right hemisphere and has isolated five perceptual skills readers can develop to begin harnessing their right brain power to improve their drawing. Edwards makes a strong case that these exercises will not only improve anyone’s realistic drawing capabilities, but perceptual and general problem solving skills as well."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I actually had to read this book for a class of mine, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The author, Betty Edwards, teaches how anyone can learn how to draw, and I love that. I have learned a lot in all of my art classes and studies, but I learned even more from her. I hate how people think that art is merely a talent that only certain people have. That mode of thinking is completely false and Betty Edwards explains why it is false. Art is not just a talent given only to those born under the right stars, it is a way of thinking, a way of seeing the world around us. I would definitely recommend this book."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"It's a decent book with a lot of good exercises. A classic for a reason. There are a few ideas in it which are in dispute - namely, that ""right-brained"" work flow allows you to ""zone in"" like an athlete during a perfect performance. Even if you don't buy into this, there is something to be said about how ""zoning in"" lets you work more freely, and focus on the ""working"" aspect of the drawing rather than the ""what to draw next..."" aspect. She in fact teaches that you will eventually draw like an autonomous drawing robot in full gear. What does have value is her chapters on children's drawing, drawing left-handed, and her section on the intersections of handwriting and drawing."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I agree with ""Maiken"" the main theory of the book is a L/R brain differentiation that isn't supported by the discipline of network neuroscience. Mental activity arises from interactions among countless different brain areas. Edwards just uses her construct to sell certain ideas that encourage people to draw what the see. Two stars says it is ""ok"" and I guess it is okay for most people even with the flawed idea that our right and left brains are somehow separate. I have, by the way, recommended it to beginning artists if for nothing else the exercises in the book."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This is the book I use to teach my drawing class. If you want to learn to drawm it is quite helpful. Trust the crazy exercises she recommends (like drawing without looking at your page), they all have a utility that only comes out in hindsight. I do think though that all her blah on right/left side of the brain differentiation is crap. You don't need to know any of that to make her exercises applicable."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Well, I was a little disappointed at first, because I expected to be drawing ON my brain (and how cool would that be). Once I got over it, though, I and the four other munchkins at the table had a fabulous time turning pictures upside down and looking really, really closely at the wrinkles in our hands. Took me back, in fact, to my early days at Ree--, oh, never mind. This is an excellent book for anyone who doesn't draw but secretly wants to."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"A great book on how to take your time and draw what you actually see. I really enjoyed the exploration of L-mode vs R-mode thinking and what that means for your drawings. My only complaint—and it's a result of what you're doing—is that each chapter might end up taking you two to three hours to get through because of how long each drawing will take. I guess that's not really a complaint because it's so enjoyable, but more of a warning."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Great book! If you've always loved the art of others but didn't think you had the talent, think again. The premise of this book is that everyone can draw...we just have to learn to switch to our right (creative) side of our brain, instead of the left (logical), which is mostly used. I loved the exercises in here; they're great to have kids do too, so they don't grow up thinking they can't draw (like most of the rest of us falsely learned)."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I've always wanted to be able to draw, or paint, or be an artist. I read this book and started working through the exercises. I became discouraged when my drawings continued to look like an early elementary student with no talent and my elementary school-aged daughter's drawings looked like a talented artist's drawings. Despite my shortcomings, I am able to look at objects differently, breaking them down into manageable sections."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards is a great way to learn to draw. Most people (mostly adults) say they don't know how to draw and ""just don't have the natural talent"". But this book proves them all wrong, I was very impressed with how my drawing improved when I read this book. It explains all the questions on why you think you can't draw, and tells you how to fix them. I suggest this for most people, especially people 30 and up."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,I think this is a great book to help with my drawing skills. There are many good parts to help with skills and techniques that would definitely work. I liked this not only because it will help increase my drawing ability but because I also learned more about how the brain works and how it is used in my everyday life and also during drawing. This was a great book that i hope will help me with my perspective drawing.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Such an amazing book. I had heard about it for years, but never actually read it. This latest edition closely reflects much of what I've been talking to people in the business world about the value of the arts & creativity. Much more than a series of drawing lessons (though it is that too), this is really a treatise on the power of developing an art practice as a means of seeing the world itself differently and being able to apply that in all areas of you life."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book literally changed my life, my perspective on the world and of course - my drawing skills. I can almost say for sure that if you follow the chapters and practice them seriously, it's almost certain that you'll draw better after finishing this book. After reading it, I looked at things differently, it was actually an interesting trip. Every face, every tree, every trivial thing around me became a magic of shape, figure and light."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book is chock full of pseudo-scientific b.s. She explains what's already known and taught better in regular art books by using a bunch of made up theories creatively masked to sound like she knows what she's talking about. Do yourself a favor and get a real art book, not one full of psychobabble. Sure a lot of people 'like' it but history has shown that the masses are easily duped."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"If you like to draw and want to do it better, get this book. If you want to try to increase your overall creativity, get this book. Trying to use your non-dominant hand more can really work to charge your creativity, and whilst you may not end up a Rembrandt, you may very well surprise yourself by what you can do."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Beautiful book. I skimmed through the parts where the discussion and emphasis on L and R hemisphere division gets too intense; what remained has made me draw again. The book is everything I will want my child and parents to read, to be reminded of how essential, easy and satisfying it is to hold a pencil."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I am so glad I know about this book, and get the chance to read it. To enter the door of the art world :) This book is great for those who are interesting in learning how to draw, how to see things in a different way."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Most art books give you instruction to improve your technique, building on what you already know. This book taught me how to draw. Literally. This is the book to read if you don't know the first thing about drawing but would really like to learn."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"I could not draw. I still cant, but at least now I know what to do to practice to get better. If you are like me and you dont know how to draw, but want to learn, this is the book for you. Recommended."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"While the theories that underlie this book are dubious, the book exercises work, and you will learn to draw in a natural way. This is a book I go back to regularly when I want to improve my sketching or drawing skill. Drawing, like music, and language unlocks a whole new world to your life."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"This book has some good stuff in it, but it's also weirdly patronizing, particularly in the way it equates drawing skill to literal age, suggesting that not having practiced drawing before represents immaturity on the part of the artist. 👎"
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,Betty Edwards is amazing - I believe she is the one person more responsible than any other for the great advancements being made in art eduction that we've seen over the last few decades.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,great exercises for the mind in this book. an art teacher in my past recommended this book to maximize my ability. it is an amazing read!
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"""If your handwriting is readable, or if you can print legibly, you have ample dexterity to draw well."" Translation: I'm screwed."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"As someone who knows nothing about drawing, I found it fascinating. The most important thing learned is ""Draw what you see, not what you know."" This will applied to my fiber art."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,It was enlightening to learn how to look at an object one wants to draw (not as a whole but as each separate part) by drawing the item upside down on the paper.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,Great book for complete beginners. Somehow I did not feel the structure of the last chapters was optimal. Ended up skimming the later chapters.
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,"Very helpful. No one had ever taught me how to draw before. I'm not good, but I am better."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Julia Cameron works my last nerve. She's always talking about looking out at the sun-dappled mesas of New Mexico, or using some other affected, high-falutin' lingo about her gloriously new age, trendy life. Meanwhile, I look out at the cracked concrete of my driveway in the Chicago drizzle and wonder how us normal people ever survived without people like Julia Cameron telling us about their fantastically charmed lives. However, I like the little mind toys in this book. I did the morning pages, and found them interesting. I strolled the aisles of dollar stores and played a bit because of her book, and it was fun. So, she gets two stars. If she were less Baby-Boomer Annoying, she would have gotten more."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"On the whole, the key to the Artist's Way is selfishness. That is something I fundamentally disagree with. You should not skip your child's soccer game to paint your masterpiece. Your kid is the masterpiece. All of the relationships in your life are masterpieces. I use that as an example but there are other moments in this book where self-indulgence at the expense of others is encouraged. This is loathsome. So why didn't I just give the book and the program a 1-star rating? Because there are some very good ideas in there. Namely the morning pages. They grow tedious for me but I do find them effective. Also, I highly recommend taking an hour or two out of your week to have an adventure in the world by yourself. This really is a great way to stimulate your creativity, no matter what your craft is. Overall, if you want to try this program, go for it and recognize which parts do and don't work for you. However, I must warn that there is an ugly side to what Julia Cameron preaches here and I won't endorse that."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This is a really difficult book for me to rate. At the time I first read it fifteen years ago, it did wonders to open me up creatively. I was still struggling to slough off some negative parental programming about being a writer, and this book (along with a good friend) helped give me permission to explore that side of myself. Since that time, however, my belief system has changed so radically that I no longer agree with a number of the book’s fundamental premises. For this reason, it would be hard for me to recommend it now. I do think it contains some good material in the form of useful exercises and uplifting stories about creative development. But those come with heavy doses of New Age spirituality and recovery beliefs that will likely make the book inaccessible to anyone who doesn’t view the world through that filter."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Another book that has changed my life! (See also: The Runner's Handbook!) I have started this book many times and not finished my 12-week (or more) commitment, but this time, when I got to the point where I wanted to give up, I kept on going, and let me tell you where I am now, as a result of this: I pitched my memoir to agents in February. I am taking acting lessons. I have started wearing clothes I like every single day! I am planting a garden. I have taken up knitting. I am taking ballet classes. I am treating myself to massages, manicures, and trips. I write every single day. I have started working on my memoir again after a long withdrawal period, post-graduation. I am having more fun and playing! I am discovering myself. If you are interested in doing this, please feel free to contact me. I am going through the book again, and I would love to work it with other people!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I can't rate this book, since my opinion of it veers wildly between five stars and zero stars. (ETA: two stars is maybe a fair compromise?) For those not familiar with it, The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a book that claims it can reconnect anyone with their ""Inner Artist,"" via a program modeled openly on AA's Twelve Step Program (it is not a coincidence that Cameron is a recovering alcoholic). As such, it conceptualizes creativity as something inherently spiritual and conceptualizes the artist as a channel for God's will. So. PROBLEM NUMBER ONE: For me, creativity is not something that comes from outside the self, but something that comes from deep the self. (And Cameron isn't actually very consistent, since her model of creativity seems to be something like the Puritans' model of the Elect: it's entirely out of your control, but you have to behave properly in order to be one. So her model goes back and forth between ""you have to open yourself to God's will"" and ""you have to find the ideas that are deep within you and nurture them into bloom."") Also, I admit this freely, I have all the spirituality of a brick, so treating creativity as something spiritual means it's something I'm excluded from, and I think I can be forgiven for not liking that model very much. PROBLEM NUMBER TWO: Cameron has (I hope unconsciously) reinvented one of Freud's more repellent ideas. Where, in talking about Dora, he postulates that ""yes"" means yes, and ""no"" means yes, Cameron explains that if you don't like any of her teachings, or if they make you angry, that just means you're childishly resisting the thing you need in order to heal. So, basically, if you question or argue with her, that's a sign you're Doing It Wrong. This idea annoys me more than a little. PROBLEM NUMBER THREE: Cameron is writing from a position of unconscious privilege. She has the freedom to assume that if you are blocked creatively, it is something you can solve by willpower alone, that it's more or less something you have unconsciously done to yourself because you are scared of being creative. She does not allow for health (either physical or mental) to be something that may be affecting your creativity, and although she acknowledges that there are people who are creative but who cannot create because they are too busy struggling to survive or to care for their children or whatever other actual and genuine impediment may be in their life that they cannot simply will away by rearranging their schedule a little, she has a serene confidence that none of are reading her book. As someone who has been unable to write, to a greater or lesser degree, for seven years (yes, you did read that correctly; I finished the principal draft of in 2009), I would like to state for the record that if the problem could be solved by willpower alone, And I resent the condescending attitude that the problem is all my fault, if I would just have enough self-insight to see it. PROBLEM NUMBER FOUR: Cameron is of the same school of thought as and , that writing (and other forms of creativity) is basically therapy, that creativity comes from the well of psychic injury. Now, writing be theraputic, and tremendously so, but this model of writing-as-therapy, as direct one-to-one correspondence stream-of-consciousness therapy, does not work for me and never has. PROBLEM NUMBER FIVE: Cameron believes ""The universe will always support affirmative action"" (194), that if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe will send you what you need. Always. Now maybe it's just because I've read too much true crime and it's made me cynical, but I can't help pointing out that sometimes, if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe sends you . The universe is inherently benevolent. It is inherently indifferent and does not give a fuck whether you succeed or fail. Some of these problems are merely annoying; some of them are potentially destructive to writers (and other artists) if they take them as gospel (pardon the pun); some of them are irresponsible and dangerous. But despite all that, and despite the fact that I did not so much the Artist's Way as it, there are a lot of valuable ideas in what Cameron says. Some of them were things I already knew, but needed to be reminded of, like that, just like any other form of creativity, writing requires continual practice. Even if you can't write a story, you can still write , and you need to. ""Sloth, apathy, and despair are the enemy,"" she says on page 62, and I agree with that whole-heartedly. And I love her idea of true north, that two people can have the same goal, but their , the thing pulling them like a lodestone, don't have to be the same. And I would follow that with, if you lose your true north, for whatever reason, you're going to have to find it again before you can get very far. She harmonizes with Csikszentmihalyi in emphasizing that the writer is well-served to value process over product, and she points out something I have, in fact, taken to heart; that when your ""sensible"" self asks, ""Do you know how long it's going to take you to do X? Do you know how old you'll be?"" the correct answer is, ""Just as old as I'll be if I don't do it."" Cameron also provides a lot of quotes from a lot of people, some of which I found wrong, some inane, some simply not applicable. But some I really liked, like 's """" (Which, okay, I'm not going to say ""The Waking"" is the greatest villanelle of all time, but I am gonna say it's pretty damn close.) Others: ""I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues."" --Duke Ellington ""Whenever I have to choose between two evils, I always like to try the one I haven't tried before."" --Mae West ""It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult."" --Seneca ""In a dark time, the eye begins to see."" --Roethke again. ""Look and you will find it--what is unsought will go undetected."" --Sophocles ""Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little. The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark."" --Agnes de Mille ""Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life."" --Linus Pauling ""The unconscious wants truth. It ceases to speak to those who want something else more than truth."" --Adrienne Rich ""The job of the artist is always to deepen the mystery."" --Francis Bacon (, not ) ""What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough."" --Eugène Delacroix (forgive him his sexism, he's been dead for a hundred and fifty-four years) ""Adventure doesn't begin until you get into the forest."" --Mickey Hart ""One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."" --André Gide ""A painting is never finished--it simply stops in interesting places."" --Paul Gardner"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"http://mrlshelflife.wordpress.com/201... The Artist’s Way, while it contains some gems, is an overall disappointment. I’ve started it several times and it took me this fourth time to get all the way through. I had previously blamed my inability to finish it more on myself than on the work in general. The book taken as a whole comes across as pop psychology mixed with a heavy dose of New Age philosophy. There is a lot of talk about nurturing the inner child that is our real artist, the child’s inability to accept raw criticism and how this creates emotional scar tissue. The inner artist child needs to be protected and nurtured and needs to have its hand held and be tenderly led through the miasma of the psyche of the growing artist. She even goes so far as to equate poorly delivered criticism to sexual abuse, and projects that don’t materialize to miscarriages from which the artist suffers as much as the woman who lost a child. That was where she lost me for good. The book is full of case examples; artists, novelists, poets, script writers, all of who benefited from Cameron’s twelve week recovery. (Should I understand this as Cameron, a recovering alcoholic, devising her own twelve step program?) All of these case characters are given to us on a first name basis. One example is Ted, a blocked novelist who after the program and twelve (that number again) years of working with the Morning Pages, now has three novels to his credit. Okay. Ted, who? I want to see his work. I also want to see Bob’s breakout documentary, the one that a teacher trashed so harshly that Bob hid the reels in his basement which was then flooded. Then, after opening up to Cameron about the lost project, copies of the reels are found and he uses he newfound creativity, found with Cameron’s help, to finish the documentary and do yet another. I want to see these works. I want to connect to the tangible success of people who have travel this path that Cameron is leading us on. But alas Ted and Bob are just two examples of the long list of one-name shadows walking through Cameron’s book. The works these people completed and published could be a source of inspiration but are denied us by this one-name, AA-style, anonymity. After a while I began to question how many of these people were real. The one example she gave that I found truly inspirational worked for me because she used the full name, a name I recognized (Blake Edwards), and a story about him that is well known. It was one I’d heard before and I was glad to be reminded of it. It is a loss to Cameron’s work that there aren’t more examples that the reader can actually wrap his/her hands around. Cameron also talks long and hardy about her own work, much of which is in the film industry. I checked on IMDB. The list is short, two of the citations are for “Special Thanks” on major works by other people. She talks about writing plays. I can’t find any. She apparently worked as a journalist but a quick (and far from thorough) internet search didn’t turn up any leads. I remember seeing one novel by her in the library. Google her name and the overwhelming return is for The Artist’s Way. This is not to minimize Cameron’s achievements but it would help if she threw up some street signs leading the way to tangible evidence of her own work that shows us her program works. Her idea for Morning Pages does have an application. It is an effective brain dump. It does clear the pipes, so to speak, but I don’t see the efficacy of a slave-like devotion to the practice. I used it long before I found The Artist’s Way. I called it “writing in my journal.” I use it when my head is cluttered with too much information, which often happens during my job running two departments in a busy hotel, and trying to maintain even the barest minimum of creative pursuits. I can’t see myself, however, locked into every morning spending up to an hour doing Morning Pages. I can put that valuable time to better use writing my novels, stories, poetry and blog posts. I will admit I did exactly what she said not to do; I read the book through instead of doing the weekly exercises. In fact the last few chapters were scanned rather than thoroughly read. I realized early on that my “blockage” wasn’t about my creativity. My creativity is fine. I have lots of ideas and when I sit my butt down and work I can actually write and what I write is usually pretty good. My blockage is my discipline, my self-sabotage, and my lack of confidence and I didn’t find Cameron’s prescription to be a healing balm for my symptoms. I started looking at what some of my favorite and most respected writers have to say about writing, unblocking, and producing work. They don’t talk about twelve step recovery and nurturing our inner child who never grows up. They talk about work. Getting pen in hand, or hands on the keyboard and working. They talk about working until it works. They talk about breaking through blockages with action, not weekly exercises and group therapy sessions. These people talk about writing as people of other professions talk about their careers. They talk about how it takes work, discipline and action, and confidence in your ability. They talk about being able to recognize good criticism vs. poor criticism, and being mature enough to deal with both at face value. They talk about the reality of rejection and putting it in its proper place and not letting it sideswipe your momentum. This is the approach that I believe will work best for me and my writing. © 2014 M. Romeo LaFlamme"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I was introduced to The Artist's Way back in 2005 when I took a college class on creativity. If I hadn't signed up for that class, I'm sure I would have never picked up this book. I expected The Artist's Way to be full of fluffy, New-Agey platitudes, and I approached it with cynicism and skepticism. However, I kept an open mind. I read each chapter thoroughly. I did the morning pages every day and an artist's date once a week. I did a handful of the exercises at the end of each chapter. And my life changed. The morning pages resulted in an award-winning nonfiction book, a series of children's picture book manuscripts, and the willingness to embark upon another, more challenging nonfiction book writing project. The artist's dates renewed my childlike love for the fiber arts, and I began creating beautiful handwork projects. I learned to surf. I joined a writing group. Most importantly, even more important than the concrete examples of creativity that have resulted, I was given a set of tools for life - tools that enable me to challenge that critical voice in my head, and to trust my instincts. I can't say enough about this book. It came into my life during a difficult time, and it has dovetailed beautifully with recovery in other areas in my life."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Look, for writers and artists whatever inspires you to create is a good thing. However, I found this book (For me) to be too ""I am an artist, I am bohemian, I create"" attitude. Writing (or any of the arts) has a greater verity for my when it's a little less ""GIFT OF THE GODS"" and a little more ""craft."" The most successful creators view their work as a craft in the same manner that a furniture maker or a bricklayer would, in my experience. Also when one focuses more on craftsmanship rather than inspiration it makes for better work as well."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"My New Year's resolution for 1998 was to finally actually DO the Artists' Way. I had given it to several people close to me for the last three holidays, but I had never actually done the process. This is not a book to read. It is a book to do and it promises major life changes in 13 weeks. I was desperate to find a new way to make a living and decided to give this my best shot. 13 weeks later there was no epiphany. I still didn't know where to go, so I started over from the beginning. Two weeks later, week 15 it dawned on me and I saw a way out and I knew what I had to do to get there. It changed my life."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"A book to cheer you on when you feel like you can only look longingly at your passion (writing, painting, drawing...) because the dog needs a walk and the kids need a bath, and you've bills to pay so you've just come home from a job that took you from the house and back to it without a glimpse of the sun."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"In essence, The Artist’s Way is a pop-psychology self-help book for blocked artists. And, like any other pop-psych self-help book, you get a little bit of preaching, a few tips and tricks and a bunch of homework. It’s not specific to any art form or technique—you could even argue that it’s not even about art. is a book about creativity in the broadest sense: it applies equally to writing, dressmaking, acrobatics, entrepreneurship, or anything that involves doing or making something new. What Julia Cameron offers in her book is a method to overcome crippling self-doubt, self-sabotage, and apathy. There are quite a few weaknesses in this book, however. First, the sermonizing part is quite literally an indoctrination attempt about God as the Creator and how God is creative, and why we should be so as well, and then God would help us be creative just as he is because God created man in his own image and if we don’t believe in his creative power, we are resisting our God-given talent and so on and so forth. Ditto regarding the who needs to be mollycoddled and pampered and healed and yadda yadda. Much of it, however, is an interesting slice of outdated hippie, neo-puritan psychobabble. Furthermore, Julia Cameron never tires of providing anecdotes about herself, her friends, her acquaintances, and her customers who, being stuck in a sterile rut for too long, have become almost like Balzac or Beethoven just by following her incredible “creative recovery” method. Unfortunately, the name-dropping is always relatively unspecific, and we never get to know who these outstanding creative persons were, so we must take Cameron’s word for it. As for the homework, that is probably the most valuable (although not ground-breaking) part of this book. It is broken down into a 12-week course, almost like an AA support group. The two essential building blocks of Julia Cameron’s set of exercises are straightforward: 1) The “morning pages” are meant to get us into the habit of writing a journal, which, in and of itself, is undoubtedly a beneficial practice: uncritically expressing and recording our thoughts and ideas on paper and getting our creative juices flowing—this is just a first step of course; writing is a whole different ballgame. 2) The “artist’s dates” are invitations to regularly take some alone time to take care of ourselves and do something we enjoy. Again, a healthy habit: taking care of the goose that lays the golden eggs… The book includes many more exercises that the reader can choose to do or skip. Overall, Julia Cameron’s programme is an encouragement to get one’s creative mojo back into gear. The most significant aspect of her method is probably honing one’s self-awareness, making things fun and enjoyable, letting go of fear and control, showing up and trusting the process. Easier said than done, but that’s indeed a fundamental part of the job."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Okay, I read over a half and this is cheating a little bit but I am so DONE with the book! And I do believe that enduring through 150 pages of this entitles me to regard it as absolutely ""read"". Any book that recommends affirmations is not good for much else but using it as a beer coaster. Then there's this constant babbling about some God the Creator - Whatever. There's more pseudo-psychotherapeutic talk than any actual propositions of inviting creativity... Oh, and the repetition of the ""artist's child"" phrase was driving me insane. It must be the equivalent of ""the inner goddess"" from The Fifty Shades of Grey or something."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I recently completed the 12-week book on my own, and I think that it was very well put together. I was already on my way to discovering a few of the main drivers in the book, but it would have taken me many years to collect them. I have been inspired by this book, and it has helped me work through things, instead of ignoring big problems with my creative process and trying to push them aside. A few of the reviews haven't been so kind for this book, which is okay. It is really hard to surrender to anything - it's hard to let go and give in to something. And I don't mean God or Christianity (which is the author's personal belief system which also influences a lot of the book) necessarily - I mean a process - put in place to help. It's hard to just do it, and be open to what this book can do and what can happen. That being said, I didn't agree with everything written in the book. It's not like it's The Creative Process Bible or anything (so don't feel like it's that way or the highway or anything). Sure, for a couple of the exercises I just wrote ""eh, that's okay"" instead of doing them, and many of the exercise questions were obviously trying to lead you in one direction. But I think that's hardly a reason to throw this book to the birds. First, if you're considering doing this but aren't sure, read ""The Artist's Way Questions and Answers"" in the back of the book (page 205 in the 10th Anniversary Edition that I had), and you'll get a really good idea of what you'll be doing every day, every week, and Julia Cameron's philosophical approach to her book. And finally, if you decide to do it, do it all. If you're like me, you barely finish anything and it takes a hell of a lot of energy to complete something - and sheesh a 12 week long thing? But, at least for me, the 12 weeks went by in a flash and I really looked forward to the readings and exercises, and was so enthusiastic with the kind of creativity this book helped me to find and produce. Enjoy it. When it gets frustrating and you don't have the time, deal with it. Skip a day. Come back and do a morning page and you'll inevitably write until you get to the bottom of why you are frustrated and skipped a day. It's a process, and it doesn't have to be perfect. Have FUN!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"So apparently you will become a successfully creative person if you simply place your life in God. And now that i've summed up the book for you, you don't even have to read it."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,I read and did the exercises in this book during the most intense professional and personal time in my life. It was a life-changer because it allowed me to articulate my life purpose which is fundamentally about using my voice and helping others to find theirs. I recommend this book often.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I love the friend who shared this book with me.... [I had shared about the great fun I had once in a weekly three-month art therapy group].... “The Artist’s Way”, celebrates its 25th anniversary.... It’s a very popular book — 3,068 people reviewed it on Amazon. 85% - 5 star reviews! So.... many people got great value. However, this book wasn’t for me. I didn’t resonate with the religious aspects - nor am I an alcoholic - nor am I looking for a 12-week exercise program to reclaim my creativity - or change my life. I’m ok with not unblocking my hidden talents..... I’m not a “recovering” artist, and I didn’t care for the many assumptions to its reference. The writing was too flowery - - life is beautiful- for my taste. I’m okay being a sour-pussy uncreative average-Josie."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"At first glance, this might seem a bit too new-age-y (is that a word?). However, as a working artist, I appreciated this book and found value in her ideas. If you're at the beginning of your creative career, these ideas can give you support and encouragement to do the work and move past obstacles and negative attitudes, especially those expressed by others. **************************** 2019 re-read: Made it through the intro material and now working the activities for Week One. This is a pretty serious self-analysis/self-help program. I can see why people would do this as a course or with a group. Anyway, I started the daily pages and I'm contemplating what to do for my first Artist Date. ******* Finishing up the second week ""Recovering a Sense of Identity"" I have to say, I'm feeling positive results and I'm surprised at how well the morning pages are working... ********************* Some pretty deep moments working with this book and the daily pages writing. I'll be revisiting part of this during the coming year."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I followed the whole course outlined in this book. All 12 weeks of it. Well, 13 if you count that week I got pissed off and nearly quit. There's a week in there where she requires you to not read at all. No books, newspapers, comics. Back when this was published (1992) there wasn't the issue of mindless social media scrolling. So it was the issue of reading back then. Mindless reading. But I don't do a hell of a lot of social media, and the plasticity of actors in movies and TV gives me the willies so I don't watch much, so it wasn't a problem to hold off on those. But I do read. That was tough and I rebelled. Rebelled against an author in her old age a million miles away telling me what to do. Which was the point she was getting at. We've become blocked creatively because of our habits and we react like a hurt dog when there's the threat of change. Being personally well-steeped in recovery culture this book belongs near the 12 Step books and not the crafts section. She acknowledges her debt to the recovery manuals, and indeed, if one were so hardlined about it, one could claim she was reappropiating much of the teachings in Alcoholics Anonymous. But it's of no great importance. It's about finding a way back to that childlike sense of play. Taking back our sense of wonder that this goddamned digital age has leached from us. There are two main actions in this book. 1. Do your morning pages. 3 pages of verbal diarrhea, the contents of which doesn't matter, simply being at the page is what is important. She's teaching you how to ""rest on the page."" 2. Go on a weekly artist date. This I didn't really do because I felt foolish. She wanted you to go buy gold stars and penny candy to treat your inner child. So there's that. Being so familiar with the weird requests of therapists and sponsors, I felt no real enmity with anything in this book. And I came away from it with a habit now 90 days old, the habit of showing up every day at the page come hell or high water. I recommend this for the undisciplined among us, like myself, who've tried and tried to unbury the artist within, the one that became covered up and discarded as the years piled on, as responsibilities bloomed and laughter waned and adulthood came in front and center. Do they even make penny candy anymore?"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,A transformative and wise book that speaks to healing and growth that goes far beyond any particular pursuit of an art form.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I am a graphic designer by trade. I've been doing it for ten years now, and I have learned many little tricks along the way. I'm going to employ one of them now to let you know if you're going to enjoy this book or not. Ready? The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity ...See what I did there? Mm-hmm. That's why they pay me the big bucks. I really wanted to like this book. Not only that, I really wanted to from it. I'm in the midst of trying to write a novel (I know, kill me), and I have several friends who spoke of it with great enthusiasm, so I went in with high expectations that it would help me become more regular and fearless while trying to write. I've struggled with perfectionism in writing far more so than I struggle with it in the graphic arts, which was surprising and dismaying. I was expecting creative exercises, suggestions, anecdotes, and perspectives on harnessing daily creativity; I was bummed to find pop-psychology, self-help platitudes, abstract hippie-dippie aphorisms, and impenetrably meaningless one-liners that read like stoner wisdom. That is an actual quote from the book. I read it with my eyeballs, which sent the words up to my brain, and my brain was like ""hold up...u sure?"" and eyeballs were like ""ya i'm sure :\ idk"" and brain was like ""ok i;ll tell her but shes gonna be pissed."" AND MY BODY PARTS WERE RIGHT, they know me very well. I think there are fantastic kernels of truth in here, and several practical exercises that could really be beneficial to a struggling artist, depending on their own self and their own process. But each of those kernels is shellacked with a thick coating of grandiose new-agey mumbo jumbo that I found nearly impenetrable. There's a line from my favorite superhero movie, , where a young woman has been imprisoned and tortured. She believes she is about to die, and it's a death she has chosen to protect principals and ethics she didn't realize she had until she'd been pushed to her absolute limits. When she finds herself suddenly and unexpectedly freed, and standing in a rainstorm overlooking London, she lifts her arms and says: ""God is in the rain."" It's a line that would read incredibly hokey if you hadn't just earned it enduring real spiritual anguish through her. Every-other sentence in is ""God is in the rain."" Each of them is clearly meant with great sincerity and conviction, but the effect (for me) was narmy almost beyond tolerating. There is a lot--a LOT--of talk that feels like it's straight out of . Cameron insists that God will provide for you. At one point she even says ""leap, and a net will appear."" I really think this kind of advice can be damaging. There are lots of people who've leapt and met only jagged rocks, and it can't be framed as their failure because they didn't believe hard enough or trust deeply enough or wait long enough. There are tons of practical considerations that she dismisses as mere negativity that factor into career artistic success. For every J. K. Rowling who used art as a trampoline to success and fulfillment, there are tons of broke, out-of-work, exhausted working artists who find themselves wishing they'd chosen painting/sculpting/acting/poetry/playwriting/photography as their hobby rather than their profession. I'd even go so far as to say this kind of irresponsible ""God will provide your materials!"" crap is the kind of crap that got a lot of starry-eyed millennials $180,000 in dream-following debt. YOU ARE NOT A SELL-OUT OR A FAILURE OR A SAD HEAP OF WASTED POTENTIAL JUST BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO TAKE CRAZY RISKS. I repeat, there are good ideas in here. The quasi-spiritual mumbo jumbo just made it a lot harder for me to keep an open mind. Coupled with her frequent too-broad statements (""all creatives,"" ""all artists,"" ""all art""), I felt myself irrevocably turned off by the end of the first chapter. My philosophy at this point is shaped by my own experience, and I'm very wary of one-size-fits-all solutions to blocked creativity. Cameron insisted at many points that I'd been scolded for my artistry at a young age by unsupportive parents, and that I turned to alcohol and drugs to mute my inner anguish, and that my lack of freewriting pages was an expression of self-sabotage rather than conscious choice, that I was jealous of more successful artists, and lots of other bold blanket assessments that just felt incorrect and somewhat insulting. What I have learned, through much toil, is that I can't write a scene until I know what my goals for that scene are. ""In this chapter, I need Character A to start to change her mind about Character D; I need to foreshadow this future event; I need to make sure Character B and Character C end on bad terms; I need lighthearted dialogue because shit's getting heavy in the next chapter; and I need them to move from Point A to Point B, getting waylaid in such a way that the journey takes two and a half days."" It sounds a little exhaustive, but I learned that it's exactly the way I design: before I start sketching anything, I have to know what the goal for the design is. ""Who is the audience? Who are the competitors? What did you do last year? What about your past campaigns have worked/not worked? Who are the stakeholders?"" Once I know those things, I do it once, and it's damn-near perfect. I hate wasting energy and duplicating efforts playing guessing games. Once I have that list of goals, I will sit down and do the whole thing in one sitting, changing very little, because I'm writing the scene the best way I can the first time. Not only do I not enjoy the process of ""free writing"" or ""just writing,"" it makes me spitting mad when anyone tries to drag me into it. I think those techniques work for a lot of people. But the reality is that I thought I was making less progress than I truly was because writing self-help books/articles like these told me I was failing as long as I wasn't writing every day. ""Just write garbage, it doesn't matter"" I have been urged so, so, so many times. I was driving myself further away from my creative goals by giving too much credence to the chosen methodology of self-appointed gurus. What works for me may look like non-progress, and that is okay. I thought it was interesting that by the end of the book, Cameron brought up the fact that art can (and ideally should) be done for its own sake, without an eye on a final product. I actually think here is where a psychological angle could've been extraordinarily useful. There is some art that I make for other people, and there is some art that I make for myself, or for itself, and differentiating those goals seemed like a really crucial component to skim over. The best advice that Cameron had was embracing selfishness by defending your free time and creative energy. It's impossible for me to do, because ultimately I love my chosen family and I will always put my stuff on hold to make wedding invitations and resumes and portfolios and business cards and websites and videos and paintings and crafts. That is just who I am, I am...like, 85% at-peace with that. I also ""mm-hmmed"" along with her description of the people in your life who are jealous creative saboteurs; I've got one of those, that is a real thing, don't you ever fucking breathe a word to them about your creative dreams. Don't you ever let anyone keep you around as a yardstick by which to measure their own success--they will attack you and your work the moment you grow too tall for their egos to tolerate. I ultimately am glad I read it, more because it challenged me to think about my own creative process as I found myself disagreeing with her. And although ""morning pages,"" the bedrock of her program, are not for me, there were a handful of interesting thought exercises that I did find intriguing. If introspective isn't something that comes easily and comfortably to you, this book might be a good stepping stone. I'd also recommend it if, in general, you respond to inspiring self-help messaging. But if you're looking for practical advice on writing better, or drawing better, or managing time better, I think there are much more valuable books out there. ( is my baby bible.) If you're already pretty introspective, like me, and you are sensitive to condescension, like me, I wouldn't suggest it. And if fuzzy statements like ""God is in the rain"" make your eyes roll: avoid, avoid, avoid."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I gave up on this book in the chapter about money. I had been able to suspend my disbelief about the god thing until then, but in that chapter Julia Cameron asks you to believe that God wants you to be rich, which I'm not sure I would believe even if I did believe in a god. Generally, all the synchronicity and serendipity and whatnot was just too much. Having said that, the exercises are pretty valuable. I plan to skim the book and flag useful-looking exercises to complete on my timeline -- not Cameron's!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I read The Artist's Way a few years ago and could see the benefits of actually doing the work in it. But, of course, I never did it. So I thought I would listen to the book and refresh my memory, and again I feel it would do me good. But will I do it this time? I have many other artists friends who have read it and also planned on doing it, but I don't know if they have either... The Artist Way is a book written to unblock artist of a kinds, writers, painters, actors ect. I can't say that I'm blocked, but it is hard to carve out time and feel creative in this crazy world we live in today. It is even harder to work on something of your own when you are actually working in the art field daily. The last thing you want to do when you get home from work is more work. The book is full of exercises to get you on that creative path, week by week, 12 in all (I think). The main exercise, one you do the whole time, is the one that is holding me back from starting. It's called Morning Pages. This exercise is doing a stream of consciousness journal first thing in the morning every morning. I am not a morning person, and I don't know many artists that are so writing anything, even spewing crazy off the wall and top of your head stuff is asking a lot. I don't think I could hold a pen at that moment, let alone actually write with it. Before coffee? I do recommend this book to all my creative friends reading this. As I said, I can see how it would work.....if you did it. You can't win, if you don't play."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"If you were an adult in the late 1990s and don't know this book, you were either living under a rock or never set foot inside a bookstore or library or community center for that matter. I was living in Reno and then in Charlotte, NC when the book's popularity hit its zenith and there were Artist Way groups that got together at bookstores, libraries, community centers, and coffee shops. The biggest takeaway for me was morning pages--writing, by longhand, three pages of stream of consciousness stuff going on in your head to get it out of the way. Cleanse your pallet. It also made me aware of crazy makers in my life, which, at the time, I wasn't ready to let go of. But I think this book was part of a movement in my life that changed me in ways that eventually let me let go of people who subtly and not so subtly sabotaged my life. I've yet to meet a person who claims to have completed every exercise in the book, but I have met many people who have benefited either personally or artistically from having read it. Read it and then re-read parts of it and work the exercises."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"i'm just randomly pulling these off my shelf, literally, i didn't even know i had this still but it's what helped me get back to writing when i did my first book eight thousand years ago, the one everyone says WHY CAN'T YOU WRITE ANOTHER BOOK LIKE THAT??? book. i always give ""the morning pages"" exercise to my students. (that makes it sound like i have students hanging around me and in my life at all times instead of twice a year.) but here it is, a teaser for this fine book: 1. first thing in the a.m.--before you even get out of bed--grab your handy notebook and pen and write three pages WITHOUT STOPPING OR THINKING. you are not doing writing writing. you are not to read it back (well months from now, ok.) just get it out and forget it. you might come up with a new screenplay idea. you might trash your cousin indigo because she ruined your marriage or spileld that starbucks on your dress. whatever. LET IT OUT. great book for anyone who wants to remember their real self."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I'd like to begin this review by acknowledging the fact that this book seems to have helped a lot of people connect to their creative selves, and for that reason I am glad of its existence. My experience with this book was multifaceted, but ultimately very unpleasant. I did take the program very seriously: up until Week 9 I completed the exercises and morning pages as prescribed (although it took me a year-and-a-half to do so). I've read on here many people describing this book as pseudo-psychological, self-centered, spiritual bullshit. Let me just say that I can definitely see why these claims were made. Cameron is very prescriptive and preachy, writing often in the collective ""we."" For example, from page 165 in Week 10, ""Blocked, we know who and what we are: unhappy people. Unblocked, we may be something much more threatening--happy."" Don't even get me started on the atrocious black-and-white sentiment here. What bothers me so much about this approach is her assumption that everyone is simply on the same page as her, with the same privileges, experiences, and emotional backgrounds. I don't care that it was written in the early '90s; not once does she mention how class, race, or even gender may affect one's access to creative modes and spaces. To Cameron, the only things standing in the way of reaching your True Creative Self are your friends and family members--at one point she urges you to label them as ""Wet Blankets""--and your lack of faith in god. For someone whose creative ""success"" seems to be almost exclusively tied to The Artist's Way franchise, she has an awful lot of rules and self-assurance that her ideas about creative living are inarguably True. It's been said that she modeled this program after the AA 12-step program. I do not deny that 12-step programs are effective and life-saving for many people--just that they're not for everyone. Cameron's adaptation of 12-step philosophies to creativity is a little extreme, in my opinion. She treats creative expression as a life-or-death matter, and unfortunately I internalized her opinions as facts for some time. And again, she never mentions structural issues like systemic racism, capitalism, or differing values that may impede one's ability to be a flourishing creative angel. The morning pages were helpful for me for awhile until I realized I began to ruminate more than I was clearing my head. I do love the idea of the ""artist's dates,"" though, and will definitely try to incorporate these into my life more frequently. In short, I do not recommend this book. If you are interested, I suggest reading it with a healthy dose of skepticism. Don't let her bully you into believing your life isn't full and beautiful unless you're creating masterpieces on the daily."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I finished this book out of stubbornness. While there are some really magical sentences in here, it just isn't worth the slog. This book was written for a very specific person: someone who has spent their life in a corporate atmosphere, who has a lot of extra cash, and thinks they maybe want to try being creative. I was willing to look over this, but other things kept getting in my way from taking anything the author wrote to heart: • Name dropping. So much name dropping. I honestly do not care. This is not why I am reading the book. • She suggests you buy your way to creativity. In the sense of: go on vacation! buy some watercolors! take a day off! There is so much privilege assumed by this author that it is unnerving. • Advice that contradicts itself. This doesn't really happen until week 10, but still. Annoying. • The thought that if you don't like or spark with any of the tasks she demands, then that means you just aren't pushing through and/or doing it right. Nah, eff that. Different people learn different ways. • That everyone wants to be creative in order to make money from their art. What about the folks who just want to play an instrument as a hobby for themselves or paint on the weekends as an excuse to get out in nature? Not everything has to be commodified. In the end, I'm glad I read this book so that no one can ever recommend it to me again. I am sure that this content was very helpful to many people and kudos to you. For me, the values seem a bit dated and it just makes me angry and tired."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"A friend told me she was doing the 'Artist Way', and asked me to do it with her. I figured, why not. As an aspiring writer, the book, definatly had some appeal, but kind of lost me as I progressed through it. It's obviously written for people who are not 'artists' per say, but would like to be. The first chapter was about overcoming mental obstacles (like being afriad that you'll become poor and get AIDS from being an artist...). It's also a very kind of spiritual 'new age' type of books, i.e. Art is from God and it flows through you, you are a beautiful vessel, etc... Regardless, each chapter gives you different exercises to do for the week, to become more creative and open yourslef up, some are good, and some are kind of ridiclous. The hardest thing the book challenges you to do is write at least 3 pages a day, free writing, by hand, right after you wake up. Which was suprisingly hard. I struggled for the first month, but after that I enjoyed actually writing every day. I don't actually do the morning pages anymore, but would start them up again later. It wasn't a complete wash, but the book wasn't really written for people who studied creative writing in college."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,She lost me when we talked about buying a horse again for the first time in a while. #HorsePurchase
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I took the plunge into this book and, like several of my friends, did not make it all the way through (the closest I came to finishing was chapter 10 ... even when i revisited the book a few years later). However, the ground I did cover helped me get more honest with myself about my creative interests. I think I've made some choices in my life that, in hindsight, I might not have made had I not had experience with this book. I think that's what is great about this book. Whether you make it through every chapter or not, there is something meaningful to take away from the writing prompts, ""morning pages,"" and playful, creative exercises ... and to this day, I have a much better outlook in general when I make a point of taking myself on an ""artist's date."" (To those who are in the middle of working through the book on their own or with a group ... I *know* she emphasizes over and over the idea of doing the ""pages"" in the morning ... but really, I found that as long as I did them as some point in the day, there was value in it.)"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book is UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC! Looking back over the past 12 weeks, it has been quite the journey…I have learnt a lot about myself and seeing the difference in myself has been very interesting. I will certainly miss this book however there is nothing to stop you beginning at the start again. And there are many practices I will take with me such as the morning pages. I will close the book with this quote: “One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time” Andre Gide Reread complete: can confirm it was just as helpful as the first time round. I will always keep this book close to my heart and allow God to let creativity flow through me 💫"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Given the praise by so many artists I like and admire I expected so much more from this book. However, once you go past the useful ideas of morning pages and artist dates, you just end up with a white privileged woman’s interpretation of monotheistic religion in a Judaeo-Christian vein with a thin veneer of 90s New Age and pop-psychology. Even though she insists the book can be used by atheists as successfully (as long as they accept the existence of higher power which lol) I honestly don’t see how. The whole thing is modelled after the 12 step program which is problematic in itself but that’s a story for another time. This was not for me because it felt like more than half the book talked about getting rid of the doubters and toxic people in your life. I genuinely don’t have such people in my life. All my friends and family are extremely supportive and believe in me more than I believe in myself and push me to put myself out there. I am my own worst enemy and Cameron gets to that (around chapter 8 I believe) but by that point I’d read a chapter about how you won’t be a starving artist because god will give you money as god loves artists and also likes to reward people with money, so I’m pretty much done with this book at that point. There is also a ton of bullshit about how universe will provide if you just want something and show up. This is all in vein of The Alchemist and The Secret and all other absurd nonsense, including Jung’s synchronicity. In general this was so violently at odds with my whole worldview it was difficult to weed out the useful tidbits from it. But I guess my worthwhile takeaway would be: show up, put yourself out there, make time and space to be creative and don’t marry that with “productivity”, because creativity needs rest and playtime to flourish. So in the end I gave this book merciful 2 stars."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Today I finished the 12-week program in this book for the 4th time. The first time, I joined an online group that went through it. The second time, I attempted it alone. The last two times, I went through it with a local group that I gathered and facilitated. Every time, I learn something new -- about myself, about creativity, about my hopes and dreams. Sometimes, I find the essays and tasks cheesy and dumb. Other times, they are exactly what I need at the time. When writers ask me to recommend a book to learn how to write, I recommend this one. It's not about writing at all, not really, but about unblocking creativity. It will step on all your toes and make you work hard and stop procrastinating, but it will feel fantastic if you follow through. It's not really a book to do alone, though. If you really want to get the most out of it, find some others willing to go through it with you. Sign the contracts and commit yourselves to finishing. It's better when you have people who will call you on your bullshit when you start wimping out. It's better to have people who will be there when you realize you're a terrible artist -- people who have seen your work and who can see the qualities that make you stand out. I can't speak highly enough of this book and this process. It's not really a book you just sit down and read. You have to put in the work to get the results. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes it's hard. But it's absolutely worth it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Creativity is oxygen for the soul. I feel like I just had one of the best therapy sessions. I faced my fears, anger, jealousy, core negative beliefs, and childhood events all in 222 pages (in my edition). Not only did I survive the ordeal, I came out of it stronger. And wow, that was quite a spiritual journey and a deep one. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting to get as much out of this as I did. Most readers know about the Morning Pages concept. As soon as you wake up, you write 3 pages longhand, stream-of-consciousness style. I haven’t been able to stick with this, because I struggle to function in the morning, and I’m not waking up any earlier. I do enjoy journaling in the evenings before I go to bed. The artist’s date concept was a lot of fun. For two hours every week, you do whatever fun adventurous or creative thing your inner child wants to do. Some of that deep stuff I mentioned was difficult, but it was so beneficial. I already knew that fear was my biggest creative block, but it was nice getting that confirmation. Now I’m convinced that I can face my fear. Now I’m learning to focus on the creative journey — the creative process — not the length of the trip. My favorite parts of the book were how Julia Cameron reframed anger and jealousy. She says that they’re maps that point you in the right direction if you learn how to interpret their messages. I really needed to learn this. I used to think both of those emotions were enemies, but Julia convinced me that they’re loyal friends that are trying to teach me important lessons. Of course, there are tons of affirmations and journaling exercises. What’s interesting is that she reinforced how important it is to trust your inner wisdom and your perceptions. I’ve been working on this recently, so reading about this at this moment, is what C. G. Jung calls synchronicity. Whenever I’d think or talk about my goals and dreams, I’d get hung up on “How?” Julia reminded me to focus on “What next?” in my plan and let the HOW work itself out. I wish I had read this book years ago, so if it’s still on your TBR, please don’t wait to read it and don’t rush through it when you do. There’s a lot to unpack in this book, and if you take your time, you’ll get more out of it. It’ll be worth it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This is an amazing book - I have done the course several times now, alone & with friends - & have always found that it did wonders for my creativity, especially my writing. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to live more creatively."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,Other friends have also recommended the War of Art as a tool for unlocking creativity. I'm interested to check that one out too.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Not worth it, if anything this put more pressure on me and isn’t designed for the standard working 9-5 I found myself exhausted and losing creativity rather than gaining it. Some decent tips but overall just a waste of time unfortunately :( as an avid journaller the only thing i liked was the encouragement to write ""morning pages"" and journal more (not 3 large pages a day though)"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Everyone was talking about how wonderful this book was, so as a professional artist, I just had to get it. While bits of it had some constructive things to say, I found most of it to be self-help treacle."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,the perfect 'bible' for any creative soul.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"From the beginning of the year been insanely busy - emphasis on “insane” - with all the preparation and marketing involved with the Huntress series, relaunching Huntress Moon and Blood Moon and launching Cold Moon with Thomas & Mercer in a rollout over just five months. But that’s not all there’s been to it. The last part of last year was really hard, in a professional sense. The delays in the release of Cold Moon made me anxious and depressed. At the same time that I was grappling with that, I committed myself to a complete overhaul of before taking it to print - and ended up doubling the material in the book. I’m thrilled with the result, but it took time away from my fiction writing and stretched me more thin than is really healthy for me, or anyone for that matter. Also, I’m writing Book 4 in the Huntress series and I seem to be writing three different books at once, which, while it is probably exactly the process I need to be going through, is also hugely confusing. And oh yeah – I started Book 1 of a new series set in Scotland and in LA. All of this while I have been adapting to life in a new country. That marginally speaks English, but not always. Especially after a few pints. Are we starting to get what’s wrong with this picture? It was time to stop the madness and reassess. The good news is, I didn’t have a complete nervous breakdown. The better news is, I knew how to heal myself. Some of you may be familiar with Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way – a classic on creativity, spirituality, and recovery. It’s a twelve-week program sort of based on twelve-step programs, but for artists and creativity. The Artist’s Way is a huge commitment. You do Morning Pages every day (three mandatory pages of free form writing) and an Artist Date every week, plus numerous assignments on top of that. This is what I decided to do on top of everything else I was doing. Crazy, right? But I knew I had to do something. Workaholism is a big problem for me. Let's be blunt - I get a lot of rewards from it. Certainly it pays off in a career sense – it’s kind of the job description for a screenwriter and pretty much for an author, too, if you want to make a living at it. There’s another big payoff, too. When I’m insanely busy I don’t have to think about myself much. Or at all. But you know…. that’s maybe not so great. The Artist’s Way is designed by someone who has had all those issues and knows the score, including all your sneaky little tricks. The first time I did the program, I didn’t make it all the way through the twelve weeks. I rarely did the Artist Date. I openly scoffed at and ignored most of the suggestions for fun stuff. And I certainly didn’t do some of the scary deeper work – like the week of reading deprivation. (Yes, that means an entire week of no reading. I know some of you out there just stopped breathing at the very thought). But even not doing it full out, the breakthroughs that happened for me at the time I was working the program and in the year or two after I did it were extraordinary. I finished Huntress Moon, decided to e publish it instead of going for another traditional publishing deal, and did it to big success. I got back all of my backlist of traditionally published books and launched those books as e books. I wrote my YA thriller The Space Between, and wrote a romance version of Screenwriting Tricks for Authors. I started teaching a college film class, which I loved. And, oh yeah - I met this guy This time through, the breakthroughs are already coming fast and furious. Sometimes I’m taking two weeks to do the work suggested for a week. Sometimes I’m skipping stuff. I put off the reading deprivation while I was doing copyedits, but I did it last week, a full week, and WOW. (I’ll write about that in a separate blog.). I already feel so much more aligned and focused. I can’t wait to get started with my day in the morning. In the midst of some pretty dangerous burnout, I am healing. It is an immense relief. So a huge thank you to Julia Cameron, for saving my skin - and soul - again. And for you all, some questions. Did you know about The Artist’s Way? (It’s not just for artists and writers. It’s for everyone. We’re all creative beings at our core.) Have you ever worked the program? Or is there some other way you’ve found to take stock and heal yourself in times of burnout? I’d love to hear!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I'm not one to ask for external recognition, but I'd be OK if you gave me a medal for completing not just this book, but the program! The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a how-to book -- specifically, how to overcome your creative blocks -- structured as a 12-week program. It's based on a popular workshop Cameron taught in NYC to help creative people recover their creative productivity and passion, so each week's ""lesson"" starts with a lecture (about 6-8 pages of content), is peppered with quotes from other creative people to inspire and cheer you along, and ends with a set of tasks for you to complete or not. I say ""or not"" because she says you don't have to do all the exercises to reap the benefits of creative recovery, but there is still maybe something helpful in there for you if you do them. I also say ""or not"" because this isn't school, and no one will be there to make sure you do it all. I did not feel particularly blocked when I started the program in June. But there was a group forming to complete the 12-week program together, very close to my house, on the same day each week that is generally good for me to meet. I also had a couple other ""signs from the universe"" that I should jump on board, so I did. The group was very diverse, with people from many walks of life, in very different phases of their careers and lives, some of whom are creative for a living and others who aren't. As the weeks went on, the group got progressively smaller. Several people said they wanted to ""re-launch"" their 12 weeks in the fall, but about 4 of us are seeing this cycle to the end. Having that peer group, to listen, to share things they got that maybe didn't initially resonate with me, to challenge and support each other -- what a wonderful bonus, IMHO. I'm so glad I for this group. The only real rule I put in place for myself was to do the Morning Pages exercise, which is 3 pages of writing about anything you want, every single morning. Actually, this is maybe Cameron's only rule for the program, too. In order to get maximum benefit, you've got to put in that minimum amount of effort. All the rest you can figure out and negotiate as you go along. I ended up filling a journal and running 2 pens out of ink before the 12 weeks was even over. There was something particularly satisfying about that... Cameron's writing style is a curious mix of common sense self-help, full-on new age spirituality, and gratuitous name-dropping. (FYI the book was originally published in 1992; my print copy looks like it is from 1996; and I bought the 10th anniversary Kindle version. It's the 10th anniversary edition that takes the name dropping from annoying to unbearable. If you don't like that kind of thing, just skip the introduction in the 10th anniversary edition.) Some weeks, I'd be highlighting like crazy and shouting, ""I know!!!"" at the pages. Other weeks, I'd just shrug my shoulders and just write whatever was on my mind. And it was still so helpful in so many ways. I feel not just more productive, and not just like I understand myself better, but also like I can manage my creative ebbs and flows more effectively. It's probably no coincidence that I found my sewing mojo again in the middle of the program. And the daily writing habit -- I never intend to let that go. It's been magnificent. The subtitle of the book is perfect: ""A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity."" But what isn't evident from the title or the subtitle is that this book isn't just for those in creative professions, or those with creative aspirations. If you are creating a life (which is most of us), this book is for you."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Omg I FINALLY finished The Artist’s Way! I mostly hated this book, though there were a few small things I got value from. Julia Cameron’s book feels hopelessly out of touch in 2020. This was the 25th anniversary edition, and it didn’t seem to have been updated at all to reflect modern times. Cameron also has this super aggravating way of looking at the world where she sees artists as inherently superior to all non-artists. I found myself rolling my eyes at that a lot. Her woo woo “creator”/spiritual stuff also got on my nerves and I couldn’t buy into it. She includes an abundance of quotes in every chapter like an eighth grader who just got a book of quotes from her grandma. Additionally, Cameron herself has a huge amount of privilege to live a lifestyle like this. She’s staring at idyllic mountains and scrawling morning pages, taking herself on artist dates, decorating her office, and living this chill life where all she does is create. Does she have any responsibilities?! I get that taking time for yourself is a good thing, but she seems downright selfish. The aspects I did like were the morning pages and the artist dates. Hard to take yourself on an artist date during a global pandemic, though! The morning pages are something I’ll try to keep doing moving forward as it’s a good way to take out the mental trash. Some of the tasks/questions each week were good journaling prompts, and it was a nice way to force myself to sit down and check in with myself, which I hate doing. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend this to others."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"1 / 5 stars Artists are the most oppressed people in society That’s a load of bullshit, and we all know it. All of us except Ms. Cameron here, apparently. Now, there is a conversation to be had as to the treatment of art under capitalism, but, of course, that is not the conversation we had here. I really wanted to like this. A family friend of mine even went out of his way to gift it to me with a note discussing how much it changed his artistic life and hoping it would change mine. My dad even mentioned reading this when he was a poet in the 90’s. Alas, I hated everything beyond the most basic of basic premises of this guide. I agree that everyone can be creative. I agree that creativity can be a force for some people that strikes at random and feels like it flows through them. That’s…yeah, no, that’s it. She first lost me in the socioeconomic privilege of it all. You expect anyone who works and/or goes to school can set aside enough time to write three pages of essentially nothing a day. Mind you, these pages are utterly mandatory and quintessential to being an artist. Oh, and don’t forget how her success stories are from millionaires and rich extremely upper middle class people. Truly, the bourgeois and the elites. How, again, is this meant to be a universal guide for artists? Then it was quantity being more important than quality. Because, seriously? Apparently, god is supposed to make your work good, and it’s you’re responsibility to put it down on paper or whatever your art form may be. And…critics aren’t just jealous. The author is literally a critic! But when she does it, it’s fine, but everyone else’s criticism is invalid. Also, tell me you’re not marginalized without telling me you’re not marginalized : purposefully infantilizing yourself (and every other artist by extension) edition. Don’t worry, there’s more! Look, I get it was the 90’s, and people didn’t have any respect for disability, and eating disorders, or anything in the 90’s. But do we have to compare having an artistic block to anorexia? Or say that artists choose to have a block because being a “crippled artist” generates sympathy? Shit, man. Have a little tact."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"What it is: A self-help book very much in the vein of the 00s, angled towards a privileged demographic. Who should read it: People who don't realize they're drinking kool aid. The only thing I liked about this book was the practise of writing every morning, but there was so much that I didn't like that came up frequently enough that I decided to stop my progress through it. The #1 thing that turned me off was that it was geared towards people with things and money- at several points Cameron suggests helping ones 'inner artist' by buying things, or setting up an 'extra room' (what's that now?) as an art den. It's restricting and, as I don't remotely worship money or materialism, unappealing. The #2 thing that turned me off, as I am an atheist, was all the talk about God. She says at the start not to let it get in the way, but it really does, and it's unavoidable. She says you can replace God with any other spiritual force, but that's no good for an atheist; plus she gives God motivations, so... Yep, not sold."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book kicked Dan Brown Da Vinci Code and got the first place on my list of the worst books on planer Earth. When I got through this nonsense to the page 108, ""You need to worry about your money first and creativity second"" it was over for me. All this mumbo jumbo about removing creative blockage and calling us recovering artists for what ever reason and then comes the big Boom! I should worry about the money first. She is nuts. Then she goes into luxury chapter where she rumbles about not denying ourselves a luxury in terms of buying something we have been wanting for a long time and writes how she bought herself a horse! While on the next page she goes about her friend who likes raspberries which she always considered to be too expensive to buy. This is just some examples of her non-logical absurd 12 step program that is in my opinion overly religious, repetitive (she goes on and on with the same sales speech for morning pages and inner child rubbish), annoying examples, useless name dropping, ridiculous metaphors and horrible disturbing vocabulary. It is the worst book for the artist, any kind of artists."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I read this one a few years back and remember being disappointed. I did enjoy the morning pages and exercises the most. I found the ""inspirational stuff"" too far out there for me, and it didn't help my personal muse. It seems to help others, though, just not my thing, too new-agey if this makes sense."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I marked a lot of passages from this book to read and read again... The heart of creativity is an experience of the mystical union; the heart of the mystical union is an experience of creativity. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 2). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. I learned to turn my creativity over to the only god I could believe in, the god of creativity, the life force Dylan Thomas called “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower.” I learned to get out of the way and let that creative force work through me. I learned to just show up at the page and write down what I heard. Writing became more like eavesdropping and less like inventing a nuclear bomb. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. xviii). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. “Leap, and the net will appear.” It is my experience both as an artist and as a teacher that when we move out on faith into the act of creation, the universe is able to advance. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 2). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. When people ask, “Why do we write morning pages?” I joke, “To get to the other side.” They think I am kidding, but I’m not. Morning Pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods. Above all, they get us beyond our Censor. Beyond the reach of the Censor’s babble we find our own quiet center, the place where we hear the still, small voice that is at once our creator’s and our own. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 12). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. But what exactly is an artist date? An Artist Date is a block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist. In its most primary form, the Artist Date is an excursion, a play date that you preplan and defend against all interlopers. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 18). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In filling the well, think magic. Think delight. Think fun. Do not think duty. Do not do what you should do—spiritual sit-ups like reading a dull but recommended critical text. Do what intrigues you, explore what interests you; think mystery, not mastery. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 21). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. Give yourself permission to be a beginner. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 30). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. The quality of life is in proportion, always, to the capacity for delight. The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 53). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I Love Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. This is a book that has given me true permission to recognize my own creative genius and to realize that it is NOT too late to become the artist I might have been. Julia's writing voice is divine, she speaks gently but she puts her brilliant ideas out there firmly, because she knows they work and she wants you to believe that for yourself. This book is NOT for the painter, the poet, the musician and the potter. This book is for all of us because the simple premise behind is says we are all meant to be artists in life, and artist is defined by using your imagination and your creative genius and finding an application to life - whether that's a hobby, an outlet, or a full-blown business does not matter, and art is way beyond our cultural definition of art. Julia is brilliant at explaining this and that is why you, my dear, must read this book. Whatever industry or line of work you may be in, this book is about healing your inner artist and about valuing your own silly creative wonderful and hidden art. I LOVE the morning pages, the date with yourself, and all the other exercises at the end of the chapters. This is a book you must own. I borrowed it from the library first but had to have my own copy. And it is precisely for you if you use that awful awful phrase ""Well I'm just not that creative!"" Argh. Never say that about yourself, ever! You have a creative genius inside and this book lets you release it. One of my all-time favorite beloved books. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Julia Cameron, for this gift that will keep giving for years."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This has been an important book in my life for the past 10 years. I have gone through the process 4-5 times.I believe the book is extremely valuable for anyone who wants to have more creativity in their life, including such non-""artistic"" pursuits as creative problem solving, creative parenting, etc. I have experienced and seen others experience great results. There are some very difficult moments, especially in Chapter 8-9 when the rubber hits the road and you are asked to name your goal and how you are going to get there. It's easy to turn away at that point. Don't. Just take a chance. I'm convinced that the best way to do the program is to do it as a group with a good facilitator. Otherwise it's very difficult to pick yourself up and keep going when you inevitably fall behind. And while it's opposing what Cameron herself suggests, I do believe the facilitator needs to have a different role than the other members of the circle, to keep the group organized and to plan how the work will get done. That said, it's critical that the facilitator also be doing the program him/herself and act as a facilitator, not a know-it-all teacher. Final piece of advice-- get yourself a notebook and do all the exercises in it. The format where some exercises are in the book and some are suggested at the end leads to too much scattered, imporant work. You need to be able to look back over and see what your answers have been telling you."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,Twenty zillion stars. Life-changing and everyone everywhere should read this book. More of a review to come but that’s really all you need to know.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This is now one of my favorite books! Funny how when you first look at a book it is just a piece of wood or paper, and then after you read it, it becomes this representation of an immense thing of something wonderful. When I first heard of this book, the reference to Spirituality in the subtitle, 'A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity' put me off and I imagine may put some others off as well. To some 'Christians' the reference to spirituality makes them think of new-age stuff they don't like, and maybe some of the 'spiritual' people or people of other faiths may think it may be too 'Christian', and maybe atheist's will put off by all of it. I think it is written to not give offense to all the groups mentioned and that anyone who is dealing with creativity can recognize that inspiration needs to be allowed in and recognized from whatever source it is. First I want to talk about how well written this book is. I collect quotes, the ones I enjoy and want to read over and over again. This book is so well written it makes me want to copy out almost all paragraphs to my list of favorite quotes. So much wisdom and deep thoughts. It is a book I want to read over and over. Second, it is so so practical to help a person be creative. One main focus is to break through blocks, and a lot of chapters are written to help a person hunt down reasons for blocks and break through them. The author prescribes reading one chapter a week and gives some tasks to do. I was doing that, one chapter at a time, but when the end was getting closer I wanted more now and to get through all. If a person wanted to read it through, they could easily go back and do one chapter at a time, or cherry pick chapters and recommended tasks. One of the first tasks is to write 'Morning Pages' every day, which are 3 pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness. I have been doing this and think it is sheer genius. For many, the missed step in the process is to start and bring something forth. Some part in us stops us from just letting the creativity flow. This process helps to get the flow going, to help analyze any things in our life that is blocking us, and to create writing which then helps us to keep the flow going to our other art or projects. I think it is a must have book for someone in a creative line of work, and for the rest of us, some outlet of creativity makes our life better. For this reason I would recommend this to everyone. Lastly, I see Julia Cameron wrote other books to follow this one. As this one is so full and seems so complete in covering everything, it makes me wonder if the others are rehashing what is in here. I will be interested in hearing others opinions and reviews on them."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I didn't finish. I stopped around chapter 7. I was actually doing it week by week as it's supposed to be done, going through the exercises and making daily update video on my youtube channel, you can find the videos here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ_W... I just realized that there's was too much about this book that didn't work for me for it to be worth my time. It might work for some people but if you have done any other work on yourself, if you have any sort of self-esteem and if you know how your emotions work. This is definitely a waste of time. I had problems from the beginning with the take on god and chapter 5 was all about that. If you don't believe in god the way the author does once you reach chapter 5 there is basically no other way for you to go around it and get the benefit of the chapter. I know it is said at the beginning that god can represent whatever you want just while you read the book telling you exactly what god is and was god wants for you and from you there is no way to brainstorm your way out of the religious gibberish. I tried I even read ahead chapter 6 and 7 and it didn't work. So yeah, I gave up. Another thing is that I don't need to be told what to do and not do by a control freak and I sure don't need to be more controlling toward myself to become a better artist. So many useless rules while all the dark side of the work on yourself was ignored and replaced by some work on your inner child. Yeah, true I would love to eat candy but I'll do that as an adult. I don't need to get something from my old room (which is on the other side of the world anyway) I can totally be happy with what I have at home. I don't need anyone's permission to do whatever I want. This book sort of stressed me out and writing this review about it, is sort of stressing me out too actually, so I'm just going to go and forget that I ever opened it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book is chock full of New Age-y woo/dated pop psychology/AA-esque spiritualism, and even though I am working on being less of a cranky cynic I found it pinging my eyeroll instinct nearly constantly. That said, in spite of being a cranky cynic, I am discovering that my ~creative process~ is occasionally helped by a healthy dose of woo and spiritualism, so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I found the underlying thesis about creative process resonated for me, which is, it's worthwhile to pursue art because it's something that makes you happy and enriches your life, regardless of the outcome (even if you never ever sell a book or win an Oscar or whatever). (Contrast with the popular mindsets of ""art is a JOB, here is how I blogged 1k words every day to success"" or ""art is MISERY, just TEAR OPEN A VEIN AND BLEED ONTO THE PAGE"". Which, I mean, are both totally valid mindsets if they work for folks! They do not work for me.) The exercises were whatever, but I found the daily journaling and artist date practices to be useful/enjoyable, and I will probably try to keep them up."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I picked up this book from the library when a friend of mine asked a group of us to go through the book with her. The Artist's Way is designed to be worked through over 12 weeks. Because it was a library book, I did it in six. My friends had started the book a few weeks before me but I still think I finished first. The concept is to learn how to nurture your creative side and avoid creative blocks. I had picked up the book years ago but it didn't make an impression. I don't think I took it seriously. This time, I found I wanted to recommend it to everyone I know. Even though I did it in half the time and didn't quite do everything, I gave it a lot of effort. It's a great book but it's not perfect. I did notice that it had a way of bringing to light the weirdest issues. The first time I read it, I had a real problem with Julia Cameron's use of God. Looking back, that was a time I was working through my own issues of faith. A friend of mine has the same issue but she also took issue with Julia Cameron's use of twelve step programs. This was something that no one else noticed making us wonder where the issue for her lies. For me, I struggled with some of the more old fashioned wording. I am a woman in my thirties with a lot of future left. I struggled with Julia Cameron's questions like ""If it wasn't too late, I would...."" For me, it's not too late. I want to live in the now - not the past or the future. There's an issue there but I can't say what it is but it gives me something to explore. I read a number of reviews of this book and find that you really have to be in the right place for this book to be helpful and, sadly, it's a place of recovery. The book is designed to help those recover from their blocks but it's a hard place to pull out of. I can understand why - Julia Cameron wrote this as a substitute to her workshops. The problem is that a workshop is more supportive than a book. I can picture that people use the book alone without support of others. You need a sounding board and someone to hold your hand when it gets too tough. You need accountibility that just doesn't come with a book. I do recommend this book and have been contemplating using it to start my own workshops in my area but I don't recommend going it alone. Find other creative beings who want to work through it as well. It doesn't matter if they have blocks or not - there's still things to be learned. I start this book over (I bought a copy for my husband) next week and plan on working through it with my husband so that he can discover the tools to prevent creative blocks as he starts his own blogs and persues his own dreams."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"i can’t recommend this book enough. this book helped me to consistently write every day for the past five months when i have never stuck to a habit that long in my life lol! there is too much to say about how good and impactful this book can be and i can’t wait to keep revisiting it, it is well worth the purchase. totally endorse reading it/doing it with a friend to help keep you on track and have someone to talk about it with!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Very helpful if you do the exercises given in the 12-week course (journaling exercises). Recommended to all creatives out there who somehow repressed their creative/artistic due to developmental traumas, but looking for the rebirth of the creative/artist in them and cultivating it for the long run."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"When I first read this...maybe 15 years ago or more, I found it eye-opening and I could see and respect its power. But reading it in 2021...totally transformative. When you are ready for this book, it can change your life."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I literally just created a new Goodreads bookshelf called ""Life-Changing"" so I could put this book on it. I started it about a year ago and quickly realized reading it wouldn't be enough.; I'd have to actually ""do"" it. It's divided into 12 chapters, each with tasks and assignments to help you manage your fear of failure and all the beliefs that do not serve us... Each chapter is supposed to be completed in one week and I slowed the process waaaay down at times (hence it took me nearly a year to finish) but I figured doing it slowly would be better than not doing it at all. (And yes it's kind of 12-step-y and yes, the author has struggled with addictions and there's totally a let go and let God AA aspect to it, but whatevs, it works!) Even when I wasn't completing the tasks laid out in each chapter (like the three months when I did not open the book one single time, when my kids were on summer break) I was consistently doing my morning pages (about 4-5 times a week) and my weekly ""artist date"" (though if I'm being honest I do that on a monthly basis). The basic idea behind this book is that the universe's (or God's) gift to us is creativity. By using that creativity, we are giving a gift back to the world (or God). And by not only doing the assignments (most of which are fun) but by showing up on a consistent basis to journal first thing in the morning for three pages and take yourself on a ""date"" each week, you're optimizing your creativity. For me, that means writing, but for others it could be painting, theater, building a business, cooking, anything creative at all. Anyway, this book has changed my life. Here's how: -My dream gig literally fell in my lap two days after I finished the book. (Could be a coincidence but according to Cameron, it's more likely an example of divine synchronicity and you can say it's wackadoodle new age but I'm a believer). -My pitch acceptance rate went from 5% last year to 23% this year. (As a freelance writer, one ofthe ways I get work is by coming up with ideas for stories and ""pitching"" them to editors.)Mostly editors ignore them, occasionally they say no thank you, and when I'm lucky I get a yes and I can write and sell a story. I've heard 10% is a normal pitch acceptance rate but I have no way of verifying this.) -My income from writing more than doubled -I wrote for a dream publication for the first time (Runner's World) -I broke into four other new publications for the first time -I got my first $1/word assignment (big pay bump!) -I broke into two sections of the Washington Post that I'd never written for previously -One of my stories went viral -One of my essays got nasty, hateful comments (stung at the time but I feel like strangers taking a moment to hate on your work indicates a measure of success, or at the very least an audience that's wider than my mom and my husband. Is that weird?) -I was invited to join a writing critique group To be totally transparent I also started working with a business coach about a month after I started the Artist's Way and it's hard to say where the coaching ends and the Artist's Way begins. I have to give my coach a lot of credit, too. However, there are a few positive changes I can credit exclusively to this book, including: - I've kind of become a morning person. If you're going to get up early enough to write 3 longhand pages before you get interrupted, you have no choice but to get up with the birds. It feels SO good to have this quiet half hour as my morning ritual. Even if I only have time for a page or two I still enjoy the quiet time to dump the random contents of my brain onto the page. It makes me feel really grounded and helps me get in touch with what I really think/want/feel. -I love the ""permission"" the Artist's Date gives me to do things that are not necessarily productive... Some of my artist's dates have included a dance class, go to a favorite coffee shop and eat a muffin, write a letter, go for a hike, draw, and working on an art project."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"The best advice I can give to those interested in this book is to carefully read the ""Questions & Answers"" section at the end before deciding to purchase it. It's only a few pages, and I think it's the quickest way (much faster than reading reviews) to garner if this author's way of thinking is for you. Then, if you do decide to read it, . ""The Artist's Way"" is really a workbook that entails a three-month long process that will likely end up taking longer than three months (it took me four months). It's simply not the kinda thing you can get through on borrowed time. Finally, do commit to this process alone. I never would've made it to the end without my creative accountability partner, who showed up for every step of the process alongside me. Even if you have to sign up for a virtual book club to meet this requirement, do it. If I didn't have some serious criticisms of this text, I'd be rating it five stars. In fact, I think it's the first book I've rated lower than five stars and also shelved under my ""favorites"" and ""need to re-read"" categories. Can you already tell you're in for an erratic, ambivalent ride in this review? I read this book's introduction many times since purchasing it but didn't take the plunge to commit to the process until the beginning of March/April-ish this year. I just finished reading the book tonight, because it's not a regular self-help book. It's basically a guided self-help course. If you don't accept that, if you treat it like a regular book, . If you're a creative who is content with the current state of your creativity and you're just curious what all the fuss is about, ; you won't get the fuss! What makes this book so powerful is that Cameron has written for a audience here - . If you're rolling your eyes at that, I promise you will shelve this one DNF, so don't bother. If by this point your ears are perked with intrigue, then you feel the way I did discovering this book and re-reading its introduction over and over. I was so scared to sign the ""contract"" that marks the commitment to begin the process. My advice, in addition to the advice already given, is please, do NOT let fear stop you. Before I committed to process, I self-identified as a writer and as a creative person, but the following quote truly sums up how those identifications manifested in the day to day of my life: After four months, I am writing as a habit everyday. I'm reading more. I've picked up abandoned hobbies again, like walking, crafting, and photography. I've started new hobbies like nature hiking. I've had spiritual breakthroughs, physical breakthroughs, mental breakthroughs, creative breakthroughs. I've identified as ""spiritual but not religious"" ever since I left Christianity, but now I could speak to you in concrete terms about what that means to me, personally. I feel committed to my health more than ever before, especially my mental health, and have accepted things about it that I spent my entire life up to this point running from. I've started writing poetry again, and not just as a way to work through trauma, but as a way to describe a flower, or myself at rest. I started submitting my writing for publication again. I got to this point over four months through the following process: - Cameron calls these morning pages. I wrote them at anytime of day, and am still struggling to get them done in the morningtime but, after much rebellion and finally resignation, I I feel best when they are done first thing. Yes, I missed days. No, I wasn't perfect. Some days all I wrote was how much I hated writing. I kept at it. It's a habit now. Now the pages nag at my mind until I've gotten them out, even on the difficult days. - This included doing some in-chapter journaling prompts. Some weeks I pushed it off, into two weeks. That's why it's taken me four months to finish. - I usually ended up working on both tasks Friday evenings. The most difficult tasks were the ones that required something from me everyday, or made me write about my trauma. Some tasks had me in tears, others made me joyful. I honestly don't know how some people do every single task listed every week. Godspeed. - Cameron calls these artist's dates, and I skipped them the most out of everything. I think I would have more creative work to show for myself if I hadn't. It's the biggest area of improvement I've identified for myself, and Cameron is correct that it's mostly fear that has me continually skipping out on them. So you can see, it was a lot of work that I wasn't perfect at, but I did it. Seeing this process through to the end is one of my biggest accomplishments this year, especially the daily journaling habit. I highly recommend this book, because it sparks real change. With that being said, I am disappointed that the 25th anniversary edition my partner was reading had zero changes from my 10th anniversary edition. This book was written in the 90s and it shows. It's privileged, ableist, and infuriatingly redundant in its narrow-mindedness. There were entire chapters, especially in the second half, that made me angry enough to exclaim and put the book down. Cameron's ego believes process can pull everyone into happiness out of the harshest poverty, the most clinical depression, and the strongest addiction. When this belief comes through in her writing, it comes off as tone-deaf to reality. Her advice to people in the worst circumstances is the exact same as her advice given to people in the best circumstances, and that is this book's most glaring flaw. As someone who went through this process while battling some deep dark mental health shit, let me tell you that this book is NOT the magic cure to diagnosable mental health conditions that Cameron implies it is. However, the process encourages reflection, growth, and healthy relationships. The morning pages alone are probably priceless to someone seeking help from a therapist and/or psychiatrist; they allow you to better communicate your issues to others, because they've forced you to write about them already. So put the bad advice into perspective, the way I did. If the text feels problematic enough to keep you from the process, then stop reading it, and just keep with your morning pages, artist's dates, and weekly tasks. The process is worth it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"https://pricelesseconomics.wordpress.... As a child, English and writing were chores. I was forced to submit assignments at school and university but this was merely a means to an end. When I entered the working world I joined a research house, writing commentary each and every day. The red ink on my edited work identified that my ability to express myself in the written form was holding me back and I was forced to improve. Over time I realised that the art of writing is an important element in developing well-constructed thoughts. The difference between presenting to clients before writing a research report and presenting after is chalk and cheese. Writing allows one to digest, reflect and critique ones one work. I’ve tried to maintain and improve the skill ever since I made this connection. I mentioned this process to a friend and he recommended Julia Cameron’s The Artist Way to me because it forces one to write every day for 3 months. I didn’t quite appreciate how profound a journey it would become. ArtistsWay_pic I love the way in which Julia Cameron links creativity, spirituality and love. I’m not a religious person but I’ve long believed that we are all spiritual beings, that there is a portion of our brains or psyche that responds to or requires a spiritual connection, a belief in something bigger than our self. Many people express this need through religion but it could also be expressed through a belief in people, community or nature. I think this spiritual characteristic exists because we are social creatures with imagination and the ability to have a profound impact on each other, both positively and negatively, influence and to have a greater impact as a collective. I’ve developed this idea in my own head through my growing understanding of the impact of positivity. When we enter into interactions with the world that have positive intentions, positive thoughts and use positive worlds, the returns back to us could be exponential. Professionally, I’m an incredibly analytical and sceptical person because these are critical skills in order to seek the truth and research complex subjects. Reconciling the power of positivity with analytical scepticism is really tough but it is rewarding. Positive thoughts don’t work in every case and they cannot be relied on to achieve anything in particular. Being a selfless exuberant martyr could work for some, but that’s not what I’m advocating at all. I think a primary focus on the self is imperative towards constructive human interactions. Paraphrasing Jordan Peterson, “get your house in order before you start telling others what to do.” Positivity is also no substitute for core success skills like hard work, purposeful action, learning, asking questions, execution, etc. Being positive without taking action might make you happier but it isn’t going to take you very far. That being said, there are so many people out there in the world who can and are willing to help us on our way. Often the journey is much more colourful and beautiful when others are walking the journey with us. People love positive people and are far more likely to help someone with a positive outlook on the world as opposed to someone who is eternally grumpy and blaming others for their negative outcomes. Looking for the positive in a situation not only cheers you and those around you but it can lead to real solutions as you tend to look forward and think about what you can do to solve the problem at hand. A positive outlook, belief in other people and a constructive outlook have the ability to create numerous unintended consequences, what Julia Cameron calls “synchronicity.” Coincidental interactions. When we unexpectedly meet someone who can help us with our challenge, when we read an article that can help the person we spoke to yesterday, when we bump into an old friend that has just solved the very problem we’re drowning with… Positivity raises the probability of synchronous interactions. Through being positive, believing in the ability of others, creating connections and loving the people we make contact with we have the ability to create better outcomes – what is more spiritual than that! Thinking of creativity in this spiritual way deeply resonates with me. Historically, I would have always thought of creativity in the traditional sense. Artists, painters, writers and dancers are creative. Over time I have challenged this notion – initially through my wife who is a traditionally creative person. She taught me the power of fostering creativity and made me realise that creativity exists in all of us. Her love for dancing, theatre and just general expression of emotion triggered this process through our relationship. Julia Cameron really rammed home those connections. The book is primarily targeted at “traditional creatives” but a small amount of lateral thinking allows anyone to apply the principles to their lives. Creativity can find expression in a boring corporate job. Of course, not to the same extent as an artist but there are areas where all of us can create better outcomes. Yes, traditional activities like painting, drawing and dancing are great to trigger creativity but I’m certainly not advocating that everyone takes up a dance class. A lawyer could be more creative in the way she involves juniors, presents information, teaches colleagues and challenges outdated laws, for example. There doesn’t need to be a linear connection between the creativity and the goal someone is trying to achieve. In fact, belief in non-linear connectivity is probably required to really benefit from creativity because the benefits of involving a junior, for example, won’t be visible initially. But who knows who the junior might become, what clients they could bring in or just the gratitude they might express, which could warm your heart and push you forward. Investigating the creativity in what we do, even if it seems completely uncreative, allows us to investigate the true goals, the underlying intentions and create much more meaningful and rewarding outcomes for ourselves and others – is there a more noble outcome than that? Targeting goals without fully appreciating the intention risks generating hollow outcomes. As with anything interesting, meaningful, or powerful, the concept of creativity is tricky. Being creative and avoiding linear thinking doesn’t negate the need to generate goals and beeline towards them. The most successful people are goal orientated with priorities and to-do-lists but implementing these techniques doesn’t imply consistently linear thinking and surface level appreciation of first-order implications. The Artists Way has encouraged me to write even more than before. Apart from reaffirming the importance of writing in creating well-constructed analytics, it is fascinating to observe one’s personal thoughts on paper every day. It is a meditative and self-reflective process that allows one to notice one’s thoughts, investigate their causes, explore one’s strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies to enhance and counter them. I’d highly recommend The Artists Way but it’s much more than a book. It’s a spiritual journey of self-discovery that is likely to be very different depending on each person."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Short review: this is a bunch of nonsense. As in, it makes no sense. For the most part, I could not take it seriously and it creeped me out more than a little bit. And annoyed me a lot. Really long review: I only followed through on reading this whole book so I could, with a clear conscience, justify my analysis and conclusion that this book is mostly terrible. Honestly, I’m surprised this book has endured in what I assume is close to its original form for so long. The author flits from idea to idea, melding together a vast array of concepts and skimming the surface of many philosophical and self improvement topics. She goes from prayer to the law of attraction to setting boundaries and so on. As a result, there is no real cohesiveness to her message. It comes across as mumbo jumbo nonsense even though I think there are some good things hidden in there somewhere. But they are buried amongst a lot of completely absurd things. It’s written as a twelve week recovery program, but I don’t know what we are supposed to be recovering from. Mostly, I think it’s supposed to be creative block. If so, it seems pretty unfair, unreasonable, and unhealthy to pin that on ourselves. Especially as most of the book refers to outside factors as the source of creative block. But then, Cameron says “creativity is a spiritual issue” (week five, p. 93). So if we aren’t creative, is she really saying we need to recover from a lack of faith? This sounds a lot like evangelizing to me. What actually is the agenda here? To convert the reader to a particular belief system? Even if that is the case, it seems unreasonable to suggest someone can “recover” from something so abstract. However, Cameron frequently refers to people following the artist’s way as “recovering creatives,” which suggests that creativity itself is the “bad” thing. It just doesn’t make any sense. She probably means you want to recover your creativity, but then shouldn’t it be “recovering blocked creatives ?” She does sometimes use the noun “blocked creative” interchangeably with the noun “recovering creative.” Maybe I’m getting caught up in semantics but…it’s a book, so the words matter. And using the concept of recovery for whatever goal she is trying to achieve is at the very least misguided but potentially very harmful. She is not a mental health professional, claims no mental health training, yet is handing out assessments and advice with the air of authority that it’s justified because people have told her it works. She is telling the reader “if your creativity is blocked, this is why and what you have to do to unblock it.” She jumps from “here’s what worked for me and people I know” to “this will will work for you” without hesitation, drawing a direct line from mental health to creativity with no focus on the individual. Most unsettling to me, though, is the hypocrisy in the very idea of having a rigid instruction manual for how to be creative. The author offers numerous anecdotes of the many people she has helped and who regularly thank her for improving their lives (notably many of these are identified as millionaires who had to manfully set aside their music to learn the business with grandfather). I suspect these were people who wanted to be told what to do and she was happy to take on that role. It’s almost cultish. Or like a restrictive diet. She is taking a good thing way too far - exploiting unhappy or unfulfilled people with promise of creative breakthrough but only if you do exactly what she says and then she takes credit for any self improvement you achieve. She is saying you are broken and only she can fix you. Or perhaps it’s more accurate to say she credits the process she has developed. She even ridicules any doubt that might arise in giving full credit to her process. And at one point she insists that there be no reading AT ALL - with the glaring exception of her book, of course. It came across as predatory and any good insight she might offer was far overshadowed by the feeling I was being taken in by this book. Taken into what, though, I never figured out. It seems very audacious to claim a complete causal connection between the following “the artist’s way” and increased creativity. Can it be useful and helpful? Probably, if you want it to be. The one good takeaway for me are some useful writing prompts. But is this secret only key to unlocking success? No. And in the long run, I think following this advice would do much more harm than good. The irony is there is a whole section about how discipline will not bring creativity. Wait, what? Isn’t this whole book about discipline- a rigid process that must be followed exactly? Well, see, you still have to do the morning pages every single day and the artist date every week and every other assignment exactly on schedule, but you must do it “enthusiastically.” It shouldn’t feel like a chore even if you do it reluctantly or hate it while doing it and want to stop. So if this process doesn’t work for you, you must not have been enthusiastic about it. How convenient. Other reviews cite this as being too “new agey” and pushing a spiritual agenda. It is right there in the title. For me, this aspect was actually a source of humor. Yes, she unreservedly refers to God the Creator, and the book is very Jesus-centric despite her assurances that she doesn’t really mean God. But she presents her ideas in such a scrambled way that nothing actually makes enough sense to be either insightful or offensive. Overall, I can’t be certain what point Julia Cameron is trying to make, but I am certain that she gives me the creeps. I don’t necessarily think or know this book/process/author is malicious, but something just doesn’t sit right at all with me. I think it bothers me that this is a source that people who are really struggling will find and listen to and continue to suffer because there is very little that is useful here. There is a lot of blame placing in this book. A book that suggests READING is a self-destructive behavior. No thank you Ms. Cameron. The artist’s way is not for me. If reading is wrong, I don’t want to be right."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"My recommendation? Run, don't walk, people... If you're open to it, this book will kickstart a super important journey whether you think of yourself as an artist or ""creative"" or whatever, or not. Julia gives you tools to stay awake to your dreams, stay creatively alive, and be patient with the unfoooolding path. This book is not perfect, and it's not a magic bullet. The Q is, are you ready to take the worthwhile risk of giving your inner artist/child a more legitimate seat at the table?! Julia can help you do it. P.S. - A major tenant of this book is that God loves creativity. We need to stay alive creatively, sometimes it's hard, and He actually does want to help. Julia talks about God quite a bit. She's a bit vague in her concept of God. Regardless of where you are coming from, it is likely the book will stir the pot, bring up questions. It was helpful for me to process a couple of these things with trusted friends. In reality, I don't think these are questions to be afraid of at all. If you are following Jesus, it will likely give you a lot to talk with him about. He'll go there with you. *IF you have read this and want to talk about it I am AVAILABLE* Hugs, a recovering creative person"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I’m 50/50 on this one. Many of the ideas are practical, such as the morning writing and you-day, and many good points made about strength, addiction, ill-intentioned allies. Etc. But there is a lot of proselytizing which is not my cup of tea (I don’t believe in any of that stuff) and there is also some magic thinking (such a writing contracts with yourself, making affirmations, etc.) with the “guarantee” that what you need will fall on your lap, or “God will provide”. I recommended this book to a few of my religious friends who like The Secret or laws of attraction type stuff but for myself I think there are more practical books out there for drowning artists lol."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This is one of those books that I believe every human should read at least once in their life. It's about rediscovering your creative self. I say ""rediscovering"" because most children at some time have a natural ""bent"" toward some creative outlet ( painting, writing, sculpture, acting, etc.) that is encouraged in adolescence. Yet when it's time to choose our profession, it's no longer socially acceptable in some way, so we are urged towards more ""appropriate"" careers. Anyway, it's almost like a psychology books because of the information about trauma, family impact, attachment, etc. Every chapter has exercises at the end to solidify the material. A guide in the front of the book suggests reading a chapter a week and working through the exercises. This has jump-kicked my interest in drawing and writing again. It has made me realize that my talents are valuable even though I'm not celebrated, young and at the beginning of a career, or even good at what I draw or write ... yet. So many realizations and revelations to be found about yourself! I found myself in tears at especially poignant chapters to me. It was excellent! How have I never heard of this book before now?!?"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book claims to reconnect you to your creative side, mainly through the practice of the Morning pages (three pages of writing everyday) and the artist date (a date with yourself every week). At the end of each chapter there were exercises which were to be completed before reading the next chapter. I did not do the exercises so really can’t comment on whether this works or not. This book is definitely more about doing the work then just reading through it. And that is the main difference with this book as compared to other self-help book."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,i think this is a must-read for everyone
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,I received The Artist's Way as a gift from my daughter. It was the book I didn't know I needed.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book came so highly recommended that I felt compelled to buy it but it's a total waste of money. The notion that we ourselves are not creative but have to let God be creative through us and consequently that if we are not creative, then it is our own fault because we are blocked - come on. This blatant Christian propaganda and installs not only a dangerous way of thinking but it's also really offensive. Build an altar? Good grief! There are so many reasons why creatives may be unable to live their creativity to the fullest - financial or family commitments. If I sit and paint all day I make no money to pay my rent (not yet from my art anyway) - it's as simple as that. And yes, the pressure to earn money, so I can live indoors, affects my creativity. This book is patronizing new age mambo jumbo from 30 years ago and a great deal in this book is spent on the self-glorification of the author, which I find highly questionable. The notion that good luck will find you if you build an altar and let God be creative through you is irresponsible and downright harmful advice. Typical Christian propaganda - don't take any real action - be passive and patient and unblock yourself, God will make it happen, and if not, then there is something wrong with you. This makes me sick. Practical tips for Creatives: 1. Make sure you have enough money to live and if possible, save up enough to pay your bills for 3 to 6 months. If that is not possible try to set aside some time every day or every week. 2. Decide how you want to be creative and book a course, buy an actual artistic instructions book. For this do some research and find living successful artists, who publish books and courses, there is also a ton a free content available online. 3. Do the work. The time you spend on the exercises in this book could be time spent practising drawing or painting or sculpting or whatever you wish to do. 4. Artistic fulfilment and success come when you learn and practice and experience joy creating. That takes time and effort."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"After years of hearing praise about this book, I finally got around to reading it. I was curious to see if it's really that good. I realized in the first chapter I'm not the intended audience, but kept reading it (despite it feeling like a chore), so I know whether to recommend it to other people. The book is written for a person who is severely creatively blocked - someone who hasn't been creating anything for months/years, or maybe never in their life. I'd say that for this type of person, many of the exercises would probably be useful. I personally know someone who started a new creative hobby while working through this book. (I'm not that person, and haven't been for many years, so I had no interest in doing all those exercises. Some of them did seem interesting though and I might do them if I ever get bored.) I was bothered by the mention of God on what seems to be every single page. Spirituality itself is not the issue, but the way Cameron constantly hits you over the head with God this and God that makes me want to avoid her other books because it's just so damn annoying. Cameron offers some advice on issues that even prolific creatives may struggle with, such as boundaries, releasing control over the outcome, the tendency for overwork, perfectionism, procrastination, etc. so my time reading it wasn't completely wasted. For this it gets 3 stars. I'd be careful about recommending this book to others without knowing a bit about their background and worldview. I feel this is one of those books that has to find you at the precise moment when you need it in order to be able to get the most value out of it. Those of us who missed that moment will probably just shrug and wonder what all the fuss is about."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Last fall a friend of mine clued me in on a web-published reading list ""30 Books that Will Change Your Life."" I had read roughly half of them, and I totally agreed: Those had changed my life. On the list were several others that I had heard of, had wanted to read for a while, but had never gotten around to grabbing. Maybe because my mother died this past year, I was feeling that life was so finite, so brief, that I wanted to finally make a point of reading these books. On this list was ""The Artist's Way."" I grabbed a used copy at Half-Price Books, thinking I would save the money and also that if I liked it at all, I would be writing and highlighting it. Understatement of the year. I have tabs, highlights, markers, and have worn out the binding. It's absorbed coffee, tea, and tears. Cameron is not without her critics. Some find her a bit saccharine. I can see that, but I also can see someone who believes in what she practices. Her approach hit home with me enough to entice me to trust the process. And here I am, twelve weeks later, ready to take it to the next level. Perhaps the greatest wisdom I obtained from reading this book and working through the process is the understanding and belief that creativity is a process and art of its own reward, and I, despite almost a half-century of self-sabotage, am totally worth it. Not bad for a $7.99 purchase from the used bookstore."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Second reading in 2022/23. Even thought I may not be in love with this book, and even if Julia Cameron took one or the central tools of her course, the morning pages, from Dorothea Brande's Becoming a Writer without having at least having credited her as inspiration, it works. ----------- First reading 2016. I've seen this book referenced by and , and finally decided to read it at a time when I felt very, very stuck in a very, very major rut. Nothing pleased, I was not capable of looking forward to doing anything. This book really helped. I did not notice any increase in my creativity (that was not the goal), but it was a great incentive to sit down and think about things that could give me pleasure or seem fun to do, to make travel plans - and then to actually start doing things that are on the list."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"My incredible daughter and son-in-law gave me this book very recently. It requires much discipline and time to conquer the instructions in it. I put it on the shelf until this summer when I had the energy to do something for myself. I thank them, in my head and my heart every day. It is a work toward bringing out the creative ""genius"" in all of us. I got some connections to Jungian theories, which I appreciated very much, since I respected it as I was raising my children. It thought it was a nice commentary on life that my daughter turned around and presented me with a fabulous gift like this so many years later. I love how things are connected. This book enlightens the reader and also helps them deal with some of the challenges brought on by other people. One of my favorite quotes from this book is about anger: ""When people do not want to see something, they get mad at the person who shows them."" This is a great book that dissects us and shows us where to go from there."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I read this as I took a group class on it which is the way I would suggest one does read through it. Talking the chapter pages out with others in a group of 12 usually called your Tribe gives you more insight as to what parts can mean. To get the most out of this book is to also work out the exercises and not all will apply or seem to be helpful, but all should be looked at and tried in the way that might open new thoughts etc to you. It asked that you write three full pages daily for 12 weeks. It is like journaling but they call it Morning Pages to be done in the morning. I found even though I do not like to write in a journal that doing this writing as I got to that last page of writing every day Truths of my thoughts seem to just come out and clarity of though come through and that is what they say will happen. The longer we write meaning each day we WILL learn more about ourselves and our possibilities. Reading the book ..without.. doing the writing is really missing the impact of what this book can do for you... read but.. Write Your Pages!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Every time I read this book I get something new out of it, become inspired, and just want to become the best artist and person God created me to be. This book makes you think about art and life in a whole new meaning and way, and it truly makes me want to LIVE and write in fun, meaningful ways to take the world, even just my own little corner of it, by storm and never look back to the boring way I used to be. Yes, the author uses some terms and suggestions of activities that would fall into a “New Age” type of thinking, however her suggestions can easily be fit into a Christian worldview—I just wanted to point this out for anyone sensitive to this kind of stuff. If you’re struggling with your creativity, read this book. If you’d struggling with life, read this book. It’s really, truly amazing, and I know I will come back to it again and again and again for the rest of my life."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Only made it through doing 10/12 weeks of the artists way. I quit so close to the end…But I read the last two chapters of the book tonight. This book/process made me think a lot (especially the morning pages when I was doing them consistently). There were lots of aha moments and I felt like some chapters seriously called me out. So overall positive experience. But some of Julia Cameron’s writing was way too god focused for me. Especially because she said in the beginning that you didn’t have to believe in god if you’re reading the book but then references god a TON in every single chapter and kind of expects you to believe in god. So that was not my favorite, maybe I should have expected that. She was also kinda preachy, which I guess she needed to be since she’s trying to sell this artists way process to the readers."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"A necessary book for anyone who wishes to explore their potential. The best way to describe it is as a 12-week course on unblocking your own creativity through daily practices. By using this workbook, you commit to 2 practices - daily morning pages (writing 3 pages of thought streams everyday - I don't always manage to do it in the morning, aim to do it once a day) and weekly artist dates (where you dedicate quality one-on-one time with your inner artist through any activity of your choosing. For example, walking in a garden, doodling, buying coloured pens and using them, collecting shells - the key is to pay attention. This is has been a spectacular experience to understand myself better and to align everyday activities with what I value most."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I knew within the first few minutes of this, that this was not a book for me. I can't say I liked this, but I can't say I didn't either. It just didn't apply to me. It was a book-challenge book I had to read which is the only reason it appeared in my pile. So once I knew that this wasn't going to be helpful to me, I changed my attitude, and thought I'd look for positive messages. So, I realized it was a positive and encouraging message to those who feel like they are in a creativity rut. This review probably isn't helpful if one is trying to decide whether to read this or not. I can just say it was positive in a 'psychiatrist couch' kind of way."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I made my way through the Artist’s Way again this year. While I find Julia Cameron to be very irritating and self-aggrandizing, she also presents some invitations into creativity that I embrace and welcome. Namely: artist dates, morning pages, contracts, and honoring Creativity as a freely flowing source in the world. Keeping a commitment to myself and this book helps me stay honest with writing, and coming up with creative artist dates this year was a welcome challenge. I plan to read this book again in 2021, will likely continue to grumble about JC, while also thanking her for the tools she offers."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Soooo, I made it about halfway through this book and left it as pending for 6+ months because I hadn't completed the exercises in it. I'm going to let go of needing to be a completionist about it and just know that it helped me to include art more in my everyday life and be happy with that."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"One of the best things I’ve ever read. I can’t recommend this book enough. Even if you don’t consider yourself a “creative” person (first of all, you should), you will benefit from reading this book—I promise. I bought this book on a whim, knowing very little about it; lo and behold, it has changed my life. I didn’t plan to buy it, just happened upon it in Daunt one day (and it was the last one on the shelf). I started the 12-week course in October, at a time when I was struggling to find a job, a place to live, and a general sense of purpose as a soon-to-be 25-year-old (i.e. a quarter-life crisis). I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I now write this, at the end of the course, with two good jobs, an amazing place to live, and a restored sense of creative purpose and fulfillment. None of that is an accident, and I believe most of it is due to the magic of this book. In October, I was stuck in a creative rut of paralyzing self-doubt and inaction. I knew that deep down, I wanted to pursue music more seriously, but I didn’t know how to get from point A to point B. My biggest fear at that time was the thought of performing my own music live—a professional milestone I knew was essential to any chance of success in a musical career, but of which I was utterly terrified. This may sound insane, considering I perform publicly all the time. But it felt (and still feels) completely different when it’s music I’ve written: I’m not only being judged for how well I sing but for how well I write, the contents of which are, of course, inextricably tied to who I am as a person. At the time I picked up this book, it felt impossible that I would ever get to a point where I could see myself doing that. I’m happy to say that by Week 10 of this program, I finally booked my first official gig performing my own music (happening later this year!). It may not sound like a huge accomplishment, but for me, it really was (is). That would not have been possible without this book. The morning pages have become my daily lifeline. What started as a laborious chore to sit and write 3 complete pages of stream-of-consciousness brain-dump became an absolute necessity to be able to get through a day peacefully. I now worry that I’m too reliant on the morning pages, but that’s another story… I literally never write Goodreads reviews, so I hope the mere existence of this one speaks to the quality of this book. Julia Cameron, I love you. Thank you."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"""Take what you need and leave the rest."" That's a phrase oft said at Twelve Step meetings. And that's how I feel about this book. Julia Cameron alludes to her own participation in some sort of recovery program and borrows terminology from those programs, so it seems appropriate to use that phrase as a critique. If you're not familiar with this book, it's been around since 1992, and lots of people have used it some way. It's a twelve-week program that is supposed to cultivate your inner creativity. There are two basic tasks. One is the morning pages, three pages of stream of consciousness writing in a notebook first thing every morning. The second is a weekly artist's date, which is time you take alone to nurture your creativity. You could take a walk, have a picnic, go to a museum or cultural event, or lots of other creative things. These two hallmarks of the program are very enlightening. But this on top of reading the chapter and doing several other weekly tasks takes at least ten hours per week. I'm retired, so for me, this was a way to structure my time and find purpose. It was something like being in therapy, too, stirring up all kinds of memories and feelings. There's something very narcissistic about it all, though a Millennial told me that's a Boomer attitude. As for the actual book, the introduction and the epilogue are pretty good. The writing in the chapters in between is uneven with a lot of new age stuff and cliches. It also is really out of date as it was written before the digital age. One of the weeks, you're instructed not to read books. That was difficult for me, but many people don't read many books these days, consuming lots of digital media. I tried to limit podcasts, YouTube and TV, too. That made the exercise quite useful. Now that I've finished, we'll see what creativity lurks beneath. But overall, in spite of all the silly stuff, I'm glad I completed the program and hope to continue some of the practices."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I went through this 12 week course at my library. When I signed on, I had no idea what I was signing up for. I saw “Artist”, thought, “I’m an artist! I’ll do it!” I had no idea it was a commitment of 2 1/2 hours every week for 12 weeks! Well, I did it. At the beginning, I thought, “This is so not me!” I still do. But it was an interesting road. The book has some interesting exercises throughout. Some I did, some I didn’t. I wrote the morning pages for quite a few weeks before I let that go. Although, not entirely. When I feel the need to express or work through something, I reach for the pages. The best part of this course? The women I met! Sixteen of us - different ages, different personalities, different cultures, different beliefs. And they have all been delightful. It’s usually difficult to make friends at this stage of life (60’s for me), but the majority of this group has planned to continue meeting at the library and beyond. I guess this really isn’t a review of the book. But if you pick it up, try to go through it with a group. I think it is more meaningful when you have others’ perspectives and beliefs."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Glad I finally got around to this one, and it truly feels like the right book at the right time (we'll just say *creative drought* and leave it at that). I can see how it wouldn't work for some people, and I admit it's a bit ""woo""...but then, everything about my own fickle, mystical, illogical creative process is woo, and honestly I often felt like Ms. Cameron was addressing me and my own specific issues. Some people don't believe in writers block. Some people sit down and blast through words without flinching. Not me, my friends! Writing is a dance, and sometimes I feel like I was born to do it, and sometimes I'm just lying flat on my face on some desolate parquet floor that stretches on for miles, while in the distant clouds a tinny, slow-motion tango plays from invisible speakers. And then, inevitably, it starts to rain... So, yeah, pick yourself up, wring out your skirts and cummerbunds and start tap-dancing through that rain. If you slip and catch yourself, just pretend like it was part of the act. No one else will notice. I'm two weeks into my morning pages. It's supposed to be too early for a breakthough and I haven't had one yet, but at least I'm playing again, having occasional fun, and not censoring my stream of consciousness reviews *cough*. Let's just call that a win, shall we?"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"i joined a workshop that read and did the activities in this book from october through february of this year, and while a lot of this book didn’t resonate with me, and some of what did is owed to the group i was in, i still think this is a very powerful resource for any creative who has lost themselves and wants to feel joy again. i’ve been doing morning pages for about 140 days and can see how they’re a tool to release and explore our own thoughts. i’ve gone on 17 artist dates and see how they’re an exercise in independence and self confidence. i don’t believe the higher power stuff but i do believe in feeling an intuitive call to create. this book has taught me how important it is to be gentle with myself rather than self-critical and judging. glad i read this one and with each chapter as dense with activities as it is, glad i took my time."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"The author was verbose at times, but had really great journal prompts."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Kinda woo woo, but the exercises are good."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Finished my artists way book club with a bunch of Baltimore artists and creative minds! We met up every two weeks to talk about chapters and traded off who would make soup to bring. Wholesome much?? This book was incredibly rewarding, but it's hard to deny that part of the ""cobweb clearing"" it brought on was influenced by the group I was in while reading it. I would encourage anyone who is in a creative rut to take on this journey, knowing that it's not sacrosanct and you will get what you give into the process. I'll have this on my bookshelf for forever if I can manage."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Excellent. Anyone burdened with feelings of unrealized creative potential should read this. Better still, find a few friends to read it along with you."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,A lot of people accuse Julia of being too new agey but really she doesn't go nearly as hard as I was expecting. Yes you have to be somewhat susceptible to therapy/self help talk and at the very least an agnostic leaning to really get something out of the essays and they exercises. Doing this with a group of friends will definitely be the highlight of 2020 for me - really and truly there wasn't a lot else going on to compete with it but still. Let me talk at you about this book irl if you really want to know what I think because trying to type it out in a public review is too cringe even for me.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"“Creativity occurs in the moment, and in the moment we are timeless.” ""Whatever you think you can do or believe you can do, begin it. Action has magic, grace, and power in it.” A great book for anyone interested in the creative process. While reading it I: Wrote 3 poems Started a chapter book finished 2 short stories Submitted a poem for publication for the first time."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,Too spiritualist for my taste but gave some useful tips that ill try to use. Im still doing the weekly tasks slowly and in a more relaxed way. It felt good so far.
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"This book just dismissed every single one of my excuses I’ve been telling myself and others, of why I couldn’t be “as creative” as other people. Also I started the 12 weeks this week so we will see if I can stay on track hehe🎨🗒️"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Why I wanted to read this book: I don't even remember how I found out about this book, which is unusual for me. It's just kind of been at the back of my mind for a while. Someone may have recommended it to me. I may have just discovered it on my own stumbling upon books on the internet. But it sounded very good and many people have been changed by it, including myself. Ways this book changed me: 1. It helped me be much more honest with myself and aware of any little lies that I sometimes let into my system. 2. It made me think more about God as a coach who supports my dreams because he made me with them and sometimes pushes me towards them and reminds me of them with ""coincidences"" or what I like to call ""God echoes"". 3. Over and over again this book talks about how any kind of creativity is a leap of faith, bravery, confidence and how it's a spiritual practice. I would have to agree, because I've experienced creating music as a form of worship. 4. It helped me become more confident in my creative endeavors and get rid of any preconceptions that it doesn't matter. 5. It argues that everyone is meant to be creative, not just the NF types or special chosen ones. 6. Big big thing: In order to learn how to be a good artist, you have to give yourself permission to be bad at first. 7. Another big big thing: this book promotes self-love, which I think is very different than selfishness. Selfishness is unhealthy indulging in destructive self-deception that ends in actions that harm other people. Self-love is self-nurturing thoughts of encouragement and acts of kindness towards yourself (this can include naps). Because hey. People need love and healthier habits and sometimes we have to learn how to encourage ourselves. What this book is not: It is not a book that will tell you to ignore the world outside and other aspects of life in order to thrive in your creativity. In fact, this book highly encourages exercise, yoga/stretches, healthy relationships, healthy boundaries, and ""unnecessary"" hobbies that will make you a more fully rounded person. When I first started reading this book a few months ago - I gave myself room to spread it out into a few weeks longer than the prescribed 12 weeks - I was very excited because it sounded like the author was a Christian the way she talked about God, and I was excited for another reason. The exercises in it and ways of thinking reminded me of what another Christian minister, Dr Jim Richards, teaches about how what we believe highly affects everything around us. The more I kept reading this book though, the more it seemed that the author was talking more about a big energy source than a powerful being with a personality who wants a relationship with his children. However, she tries to make the book accessible to people of all backgrounds and not be preachy. One more thing. The preconceptions the author has about her audience are sometimes incorrect. Some of the exercises and questions in this book probably won't apply to you or your background. Having said those things, there is so, so, so much truth in this book that is valuable and that I've never seen in other books on writing (that includes Stephen King's book On Writing) and there's far less language in this one. I highly recommend it to any and all artists, especially anyone dealing with writer's block or creative insecurities. Take notes, think about it, talk to people about the ideas in it. It's one of those books you'll want to talk about with creative friends to confirm or disprove the ideas in it. Use the book in the way that is most helpful to you. Go read it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Once I started reading this book and talking about it, I found out that everyone already knew about it. But just in case you haven't found it yet, I'll write my review. This book charts a 12-chapter course to be executed over 12 weeks or more, to ""recover"" from an artistic slump. But it winds up being much more broadly applicable for finding one's creative fount for overall life rejuvenation. This book is the friend who encourages you to uncover the things you always meant to do, and make the space in your life for the unlikely, inexplicable things that uniquely make you happy and fulfilled. I'm still not someone who would describe herself as an artist, and yet artistic play and creativity are at the root of my joy and this book helped to reignite that."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"First the good. This book has a few good tools and if you are struggling with discipline to work at your art then this book can help you with that. While this book contains practical tools like the ""daily pages"" and ""artist dates"" there is far too much fluff and unverifiable mumbo jumbo to recommend it to anyone. For example, There are also far too many second hand testimonials. For example, Just tell me why I should do the ""morning pages"". Tell me what they do for me! Don't tell me about some guy's (that may or may not exist) experience with your program. I've already bought the damn book! Following the ""Artist's Way"" in the book will help you if you are an artist and there is some good to come out of this book but the majority is just meaningless words meant for people who want to believe them."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I started writing morning pages on March 9 2020, and they quickly became An Unintentional Record of the Apocalypse. I ended up pushing through anyway, because what else was there to do in lockdown other than try to rehabilitate my creativity, flippant and useless as that seemed at the time? I'm glad I did. The Artist's Way first caught my attention when I realized multiple artists across many mediums who I admired cited it as influential. I'm not sure it will be helpful to absolutely everyone and I remain puzzled as to how a book this blatantly spiritual and woo-woo has been found to be helpful by so many atheists and agnostics, but pushing past the Law of Attraction bullshit, Cameron has at the very least laid out a useful collection of exercises and probing questions that assist in investigating and pushing past creative blocks. I found much of the work I was doing aligned well with concepts and deeper questions I had already been asking myself in therapy. I think Cameron would refer to that as ""synchronicity"" rather than coincidence. I didn't consider myself to be an artist when I started this book. I still don't now that it's over. But I feel more free to engage in creative pursuits without self-criticism and that's exactly what I was hoping to achieve. I picked up the guitar again. I'm drawing little doodles simply because they amuse me. I'm writing programs in Javascript and designing woodworking projects for cat furniture. I'm making time lapse videos and memes and posting them on Instagram to my audience of <100 personal friends just because I feel like it. I'm having fun doing things I felt too paralyzed to even start a couple months ago. That's worth a lot in my book."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"Is it too cliche to say this book may have changed my life? Because it looks like it. That is not to say that I agree 100% with every philosophy or idea in this book. It is to say that I've been able to take those ideas, bend-twist-modify and then use them to push forward my work as a writer (and artist?). The book promotes a general mindfulness that has had several helpful side effects for me - 1) It has helped me be kinder to myself 2) It has helped me turn emotions like sadness, helplessness and envy into actionable plans 3) it has helped me take the driver's seat through many occasions of anxiety and panic and ACTUALLY steer myself away 4) It has improved my relationship to food, especially in moments of stress 5) It has changed the way I see exercise and physical activity 6) It has helped me reengage with several passions I had as a child and some that I had let go off as an adult. I do have to add this disclaimer though - the book came for me at a time in my life when I was very ready and open to receiving this sort of guidance. So while some of the language and imagery can be very religious and God-oriented, I was able to be flexible and take that to mean what I needed it to mean in my life. I would still 100% recommend it to everybody in the WORLD, and only ask that you be open and receptive to modifying the ideas to suit your own concept of divinity."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I WILL READ THIS BOOK AGAIN & AGAIN UNTIL I AM FULLY PRACTICING IT. This book deserves No.1 self-help book ever! A truly inspiring work helping you to look deeper into your self and leading you towards creative recovery. It is about finding and nurturing the child artist inside you. Although I liked the entire book, following sentences are worth remembering on this journey of self exploring: - To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong. There will be many times when we won’t look good—to ourselves or anyone else. We need to stop demanding that we do. It is impossible to get better and look good at the same time. - In order to move from the realm of shadows into the light of creativity, shadow artists must learn to take themselves seriously. With gentle, deliberate effort, they must nurture their artist child. Creativity is play, but for shadow artists, learning to allow themselves to play is hard work. - “If you want to work on your art, work on your life.” That’s another way of saying that in order to have self-expression, we must first have a self to express. That is the business of the morning pages: “I, myself, feel this way . . . and that way . . . and this way. . . . No one else need agree with me, but this is what I feel.” - As we lose our vagueness about our self, our values, our life situation, we become available to the moment. - We must learn to cope with the Test moments"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,"I decided to abandon this book. I was excited about it, and thought it would give me a lot of insights for my creative writing process, but I got disappointed from the beginning. It focuses a lot on god, listening to god, etc. So, I think it is not the right material for me. It is targeted to a very specific audience. Even when Julia Cameron tries to clarify in the introduction that when she refers to god it doesn’t have to be necessarily interpreted as something religious, it does feel religious when she mentions god. Her clarification sounds more like a failed attempt to have a wider audience. Also, I think this book could be useful for someone who is just (re)discovering her/his artistic self, not for people who have experimented already for some time. I had that rediscovering phase with creative writing more than three years ago... so, it’s possible that if I had started reading the book at that time, I would have appreciated it a bit more. Now I am at another level with my writing. Maybe I got to know about the book too late. So, no, I won’t read ‘The artist’s way’. Not for me, not at this moment of my life."
