Book Title,Review Text
The Shining,"If you had not read The Shining already, the 2013 publication of Doctor Sleep, the sequel, presented an opportunity to revisit one of the best ghost stories of our time, a perfect justification for stepping through those bat-wing doors for the first time. It has been a lifetime since I read for the first time, over thirty years ago. I enjoyed it then for its effectiveness in telling a scary, no, a very scary story. Reading it now is colored, as is all of life, by our accumulation (or lack of accumulation) of experience. We see, or appreciate colors, textures, shapes, structures, and feelings with more experienced, educated eyes. We have seen, or are at least aware of real world things that are scarier than any fictional spectres. So, what does it look like through old, cloudy lenses? It remains a very scary story. The things that stand out for me now are not so much the deader rising up out of a bathtub to pursue a curious child, although that is still pretty creepy, or the mobile topiary, which still works pretty well at making the hair on one’s neck and arms stand at attention. But King was using the haunted house trope to look at more personal demons. And those shine through more clearly now. He had some drinking issues at the time he wrote the book, when he was 30, and concern about that is major here. Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, no question. He also has issues with anger management, not that the little shit he clocks while teaching at a New England prep school didn’t have it coming. He did. But one cannot do that to a student, however deserving, and expect to remain employed for long. His little boy, however, most certainly did not deserve a broken arm. Jack is very remorseful, and wants to make things right. He manages to get a gig taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter. It will offer him a chance to get something right after a string of getting things wrong, offer a chance to save his marriage, and offer an opportunity to work on his unfinished play. Risky? Sure. But a gamble worth taking. And his wife, Wendy, agrees, despite having serious misgivings. There are no attractive alternatives. Of course, we all know that the Overlook is not your typical residence. Odd things happen, sounds are heard, thoughts from somewhere outside find their way into your mind. Jack is targeted, and boy is he vulnerable. But five-year-old Danny is the real key here. He is the proud possessor of an unusual talent, the of the book’s title. Danny can not only do a bit of mind-reading, he can also see things that other people cannot. And for a little guy he has a huge talent. He also has an invisible friend named Tony with whom only he can communicate. It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran. By the way, the hotel is based on a real-world place, the Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado. And the Overlook’s spooky room 217 was inspired by the supposedly at the Stanley. The room number was changed in the film to 237, at the request of the Timberline hotel, which was used for exterior shots. There is so much that differentiates Kubrick’s film from the book that they are almost entirely different entities. The differences do require a bit of attention here. First, and foremost, the book of is about the disintegration of a family due to alcoholism and anger issues. How a child survives in a troubled family is key. The film is pretty much pure spook house, well-done spook house, but solely spook house, nonetheless, IMHO. There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time. You have to read the book to get that. Jack is a victim, as much as Wendy and Danny. You would never get that from the slobbering Jack of the film. The maze in the book was pretty cool, right? I liked it too, but it does not exist in the book. I believe it was put in to replace the talented topiary, which is the definition of a bad trade. There is significant violence in the book that never made its way into Kubrick’s film, but which very much raises a specter of domestic violence that is terrorizing real people living in real horror stories. There are a few lesser elements. Jack wielded a roque mallet, not an axe. Danny is not interrupted in his travels through the corridors by Arbus-like twin sisters. And the sisters in question are not even twins. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. An interesting film, for sure, but not really the most faithful interpretation of the book. King saw that a film that more closely reflected what he had written reached TV screens in 1997, with a six-hour mini-series version. The opening shot was filmed on the in Montana’s Glacier National Park in Montana. I have had the pleasure (7 times in one visit) and recommend the drive wholeheartedly. It is a pretty narrow road though, so you will have to drive carefully. Bring along the appropriate musical media for the best effect, Wendy Carlos’s , and dress warmly. It was below freezing when I reached the top of the road, in August. Some exteriors for Kubrick’s film were shot at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon. I visited but did not stay there back in 2008. Sadly I do not have any decent personal photos from the place. I can report, though, on a bit of kitsch. There is a place in the hotel where an ax is lodged in a block of wood, with HEEEEERE’s JOHNNY on the ax, a tourist photo-op. And yes, I did. Sadly, or luckily, the shot did not come out well, so you will be spared. Back to the book, Danny’s talent is a two-edged sword. He is afflicted with seeing more than anyone his age should have to see, but on the other hand, he has a tool he can use to try to save them all. Whether he can or not is a core tension element here. King is fond of placing his stories in literary context. He peppers the text with references to various relevant books and authors. I expect these are meant to let us know his influences. Horace Walpole, author of , a Gothic classic, is mentioned, as is Shirley Jackson, of fame. King had used a quote from this book in . A family saga rich with death and destruction, is mentioned as are some more contemporary items, like , the idealized antithesis to the Torrance Family, and novelist Frank Norris. The primary literary reference here is Poe’s , which is cited many times. There had been a costume ball back in hotel’s history and it is the impending climax of that party, the unmasking, that looms here. And toss in nods to and for good measure. King often includes writers in his work, avatars for himself. Jack Torrance is a writer as well as a teacher. The play that Jack is writing undergoes a transformation that mirrors Jack’s own. In fact, there is a fair bit or mirroring going on here. Jack’s affection for his father as a kid was as strong as Danny's is for him. His father was an abusive alcoholic. While Jack is not (yet) the monster his father was, he is also an alcoholic with abusive tendencies. He’s right. I have had the pleasure and I know. Wendy gets some attention as well, as we learn a bit about her mother, and see Wendy’s fear that she has inherited elements of her mother’s awfulness. Not everything shines here. There are times when five-year-old Danny seems much older than his tender years, even given his extraordinary circumstances. It struck me as surprising that there is no mention of anyone suggesting that maybe Jack might attend an AA meeting. But these are like single dead pixels on a large screen. If you want to read horror tales that are straight up scare’ems, there are plenty in the world. But if you appreciate horror that offers underlying emotional content, and I know you do, my special gift tells me that is a brilliant example of how a master illuminates the darkness.

The Shining,"This was my 4th-time reading The Shining. You read that correctly, the 4th-time. I'm aware rereading isn't for everyone, but I am a huge supporter and fan of rereading, especially tried and true favorites. I know a lot of people feel it is a waste of time, but for me, when a story is special enough to you, each time with it is like a whole new experience. That's exactly how I feel every time I open the pages of this book. Additionally, I feel like where I am at in my life plays a huge role in what I take out of a reading experience. For example, the first time I read this, I was in high school. You better believe that 14-year old Meg walked away from this having picked up on different things than 44-year old Meg does, reading it now. My experiences have shown me that rereading allows me to focus on different areas of any particular story. This time around, for me, I felt myself really drawn to the private thoughts and emotions of this cast of characters. Jack's experience, in particular, as he struggles with the position he finds himself in, his loitering addiction and the love for his family, hit me hard this time. Instead of seeing his horrible aspects front and center, I thought more about what was going on with him internally. There were moments of clarity for him, when he could see beyond the fog of the hotel's power, moments where he cherished his son and wife, but they would slip away like mist. It made my heart ache for the whole family. This experience also reiterated for me how much I love Wendy and Hallorann. They got played dirty in the movie adaptation and we all know it. Not by the actors, the acting was fantastic, but yeah, they feel like completely different people in the book, IMO. Again, I was beyond impressed with some of the scenes in this still having the ability to scare the shit out of me, even after all these years. The perfect example would be the first time Jack tries to trim the topiary. That freaking scene gets my pulse racing every time! I also felt like I paid more attention to the history of The Overlook this time through; like when Jack is looking into it. I really felt focused in those sections and loved being reminded of its intensely lurid history. Finally, I would just give all the stars in the universe, yet again, to King's sense of place with this one. His ability to transform a hotel into an actual character in the story is just a masterpiece. It's basically the standard to which I compare atmosphere in all other stories. I'm so glad I took the time to reread this. It was exactly what I needed to re-energize my reading. You better believe, this won't be the last time either! Here's the thing, July hasn't been the best reading month for me. I've had a lot of 2-to-3-star books. I'm frustrated. I'm getting disgruntled and burnt out on it honestly. I have never been in a reading slump before, but I definitely feel myself drifting into that territory... I feel like in an effort to keep that from happening, I am going to reread one of my top-3 favorite books of all-time. If anyone can shake me out of this funk, it's Jack Torrance. I hear the fourth times a charm!!! Hi. Hello! It's me again, with another book you should consider picking up, if you haven't read it yet. is my second favorite book of all time. A true . I have read it a few times and it gets me EVERY. DAMN. TIME. This is one of the most atmospheric books I have , with , ultimately becoming a character in its own right. There are so many chilling moments from crazed topiary animals, to haunted elevators, and evil playground equipment. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Read it. Read it now! is best read on a cold, windy night, when you are home alone and there is the slight possibility that you may lose electricity. Candles burning are a must for this one!"
The Shining,"i- i don't even know what to say that hasn't already been said about this but lemme give it a shot. god DAMN this is king at his best. i know, i know, ""kat that is so cliche. couldn't you have picked a less popular king book to stan?"" i guess not, but hear me out. 1. first of all, i love a good old fashioned haunted house story and that's exactly what this is. the slow progression of madness that overtook jack and the introduction of new ghosts (or hallucinations, whatever you decide) was INCREDIBLE. not to mention the thing that i think king writes best is the feeling of confinement, and what's more confining than being snowed into a haunted hotel that literally wants you dead?? oh right, nothing. 2. the characterization!!! ah! the way that king wrote these characters was just *chefs kiss* not only did i care about danny, wendy, and (sometimes) jack, but we also got to rip back the layers of their relationships with each other and dynamic as a family which i LOVE. even if you don't think this is a great horror story, don't deny it is a baller family drama. 3. the horror of it all. whether you want to look at it as a family being attacked by ghosts, or a father being overcome by an extreme case of cabin fever, or even if the whole murdering thing doesn't scare you but you can see the fear that comes with having a family member who battles with some kind of addiction, this book is fucking scary. it may not have made me physically jump or scream, but i can tell you that it's a story that is gonna stick in my brain and not let go for a long long time (just like any good horror should) now for the obligatory comparison to the movie: it's common knowledge that king himself hates the Kubrick movie, but i love it. so much. it's one of the first horror movies i ever saw and i've seen it many times since, so while it's a popular opinion to love the book and shit on the movie i just can't bring myself to do it. yes, they're very different in a lot of ways, but honestly i think that Kubrick did the best with what he had to work with. a BIG part of the novel is rooted in internal conflict. we spend so much time inside of jack, danny, and wendy's heads that it would have been impossible (imo) to translate that to the screen without a near constant voiceover (like basically just the audiobook playing over all the scenes) sO, i can't fault the movie for what it lacks in depth of character and explanation...i just can't. however, if for some reason you're reading this and you have seen the movie but haven't read the book YOU BETTER READ THE FCKING BOOK ARE YOU JOKING?? READ IT. anyway, dear mr. stephen king, i'm sorry i ever said that your popular books were overhyped. some of them are *cough* IT *cough* but this one isn't. luv, kat okay that's all read this book i don't have an outro okay byeeeee"
The Shining,"This scene from Friends pretty much sums up my feelings about this book: ""Rachel: Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so. But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer? Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know. How often do you read it? Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again? Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining? The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours."""
The Shining,"This was most excellent; I can 100% see why this is many readers favorite Stephen King novel. Heck, it's my favorite novel of his to date, although I have a good number of his books to catch up on. I've found myself overly critical of his work in the past, possibly due to the fact that he's so well known, but I feel it's more been a fault on my end. Previously I've picked up one of his doorstops at a time I wasn't prepared to fully invest in the time and energy it takes to immerse oneself into his world building and lengthy details. This time, I was ready. (Also, this was only like 600 pages which felt like a novella compared to IT.) I'm finally able to understand why so many people hold the standard of traditional horror in comparison to this novel. Sure, it has all the creepy crawlies and spooky wookies to get your heart racing, but it's so grounded in reality that I had a hard time rationalizing with myself that ""it's just a story."" The 150 page set up is well worth the reader's time, as it lays the groundwork for much of the behind the narrative, and it also gave me a chance to bond with precious Danny before the shit hit the fan. I may be the last person on the planet to have read this book, but just in case I'm not, I wanted to share some of the things that really hit home with me. Just like is, at heart, a disturbing coming-of-age story, was an impeccable tale of extreme cabin fever with a hefty dose of ""the destructive nature of alcoholism"". When you break it down like that, the supernatural elements actually seem to take a backseat to the very real horror of what it's like living with someone struggling through addiction. I've heard all the stories of how this book helped SK realize his own struggle with alcohol, and I'm inclined to believe it's true as the writing here was heavy laden with emotion and depth. I apologize for ever calling Mr. King over-hyped. I'm grateful my previous experiences with his wordier novels didn't deter me from finally choosing to read this, as it's a gem of a book and a classic in it's genre. ;) Highly recommended to any other below-the-rock dwellers who may not have happened across this one. Now- to watch the movie or not?"
The Shining,"I'm genuinely asking here because I'm a horror aficionado, so I don't know what all constitutes that genre. To a layman like myself, was horror because it scared the piss out of me and I couldn't sleep without the lights on for a while. is more like a . Yeah, yeah, there at the end things got a little hairy, but it was still a human trotting around getting all stabby. Now, I say because good old Jack getting some help from a couple of freaky paranormal spectres and... In an effort to be transparent, I feel like I should mention that I've never actually watched the movie that was based on this bestselling novel. My husband (who has stopped being surprised by me) gasped out loud when I told him that a few days ago. So, I'm guessing from his reaction that I'm probably in the minority. Now, normally, whether or not you've seen the movie doesn't matter at all, but this is a pretty iconic movie we're talking about, so even having seen it, I kind of knew the plot a bit and (of course) knew who acted the starring roles. I know, I know. None of that matters at all when you're talking about a book. But I just thought it might be relevant because the movie is so incredibly well known that even peasants like myself who haven't seen it, immediately recognize certain images from the film. Jack Nicholson is not the Jack Torrence I was seeing in my head, as described by Stephen King. King's Jack was a handsome young guy who was married to a beautiful woman. Now, Shelly Duval is a fine actor and so is Nicholson. But... Anyway. I was just surprised to find out that the characters in the book were hotties. Alright. The gist is that there's this guy (Jack) who made a few because he was a bit boozy, and is now trying to go straight and get it together for his family. He's a bit of a pompous ass, truth be told. One of those people who feel as though everyone around them just doesn't their tortured genius, you know? But he's not that guy. Which is where King's brilliance as a writer comes in. He doesn't make Jack the , he makes Jack . He's . He's trying so hard to stay on the wagon, he's trying so hard to be a better husband, and he's trying so hard to be the father Danny deserves. And if he hadn't landed a job at a fucking Haunted Hotel, I truly believe he would have made it work. Regardless, Jack is only one of the important characters in this Hallmark Family Movie Channel story. You also have Jack's sweet and beautiful (if a bit too mousy and faithful to the old fucker) wife, Wendy. And, of course, their little son, Danny. Danny has . <--which, when I found this out, FINALLY explained the name of this fucking book to me! Do you know how many this has been subconsciously niggling at my brain? Well, neither do I. But when fellow psychic, mind reader, and hotel employee, Dick Hallorann, tells Danny what rooms to avoid over the winter because he can feel Danny's super-bright ? It was like a puzzle I didn't even know I was trying to solve clicked into place! It was one of those moments you have where you suddenly realize that there's you don't know. For one brief second, I felt like the universe had given me a high-five I hadn't asked for and then didn't even pull away at the last second. So, what happens when you toss a recovering alcoholic with a penchant towards abusive behavior, an overly-optimistic woman who tends to flutter instead of walk, and a 5 year old who can tell what they are both thinking, inside of a hotel that basically wants to eat them? Well, I don't want to spoil anything for the 3 people who don't know how all this turns out, but... Anyway. Good stuff. I'm glad my pals forced me (once again) outside my comfort zone. Buddy Read with 4/16"
The Shining,
The Shining,"About as perfect a haunted house story as can be, King was at his best here. It's as though he built a haunted house and then filled every nook and cranny with detail. King is also at his best in regard to characterization, all well rounded and complete, we know family relationships, group dynamics, all the old hidden buried fears. King touches base with psychological elements, theological, metaphysical, spiritual, and cryptic aspects of a ghost story to wrap the reader in a blanket of horror. ** I watched the 1980 Stanley Kubrik film recently and this made me want to reread the book (which I need to anyway). Kubrik's film grasps the psychological elements of the book and delivers an extra large thin crust The Works pizza of haunted house horror. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is still the defining image of this tortured man. While some critics have derided the slow pace of the film (atypical for jump-out-and-yell-BOO! horror fliks of the time) I felt that Kubrik was building the tone and mood of the story to the grisly final moments. King himself has attributed mixed emotions to the film as an adaptation, but has consistently agreed that the imagery of an internal struggle with the dark side of Jack's psyche is a contribution to the horror film genre. King also disagreed with the casting of Nicholson who too closely identified with insanity (due largely to his exceptional work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Interestingly, King himself was battling alcoholism while writing the classic and viewing his work and Kubrik's vision from this perspective adds greater depth to an understanding and appreciation of both."
The Shining,"Quite simply put, The Shining is the best horror story I have ever read. It scared the hell out of me. Over a period of time, I have noticed certain standard ""motifs"" in horror stories. One of these I call ""The Lost Child"". Such stories will typically involve a child, who can see what the silly grownups cannot see (or, even if they do see, don't acknowledge because it goes against reason and logic): and who fights, however high the odds stacked against him/ her are. Danny Torrance is such a boy. Danny can read minds. He can see the frightening thoughts inside his Dad's and Mom's heads (""DIVORCE"", ""SUICIDE"") but is powerless to do anything about it. Danny does not know that he has a gift; he takes it as a matter of course, until Dick Halloran of the Overlook Hotel tells him that he ""shines on"". Jack Torrance, Danny's Dad, reformed alcoholic and struggling writer, is trying to put his life back together after a tragedy. He gets what he sees as the ideal chance when he lands the job of caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. In the snowed-in hotel with only his son and wife Wendy, Jack assumes that he will get enough quality time to be with his family, patch up old quarrels, and write that breakout novel. But the Overlook has other plans. The hotel, which feeds on and grows in strength from the evils committed on its premises, wants Danny-permanently-to join its crew of ghostly inhabitants. And to do that, it needs to get to Jack... The novel slowly grows in horror, starting with mild unease, moving up through sweaty palms and dry mouth, to pure, gut-wrenching terror. Jack's slow slide into madness is paralleled by the growth in power of the hotel's dark miasma, and Danny's extraordinary capabilities. We are on a roller-coaster ride into darkness. The world of grownups is often frighteningly incomprehensible to young children: these fears seldom die as we grow up, but remain dormant in our psyche. There are very few of us who does not have a ghost in our childhood somewhere. It is when the writer invokes this ghost that story gets to us. King does a masterly job of awakening that child, and putting him/ her in the midst of childhood terrors through the alter ego of Danny Torrance, lost in the cavernous corridors of the Overlook. There are a lot of passages which literally creeped me out in this novel (the topiary animals, the fire hose in the corridor, the woman in the bathroom to name a few). As King has said elsewhere, the monster behind the door is more frightening than the monster slavering at you: this book is full of such monsters. More importantly, you will keep on remembering your own boogeymen while you are reading; and long after you finish, you will feel the urge to look behind you. Horror stories are a form of catharsis. As King says, the writer takes you to the body covered under the sheet: you feel it, and are frightened. A true masterpiece."
The Shining,"Years ago, I stayed at a brand new Vegas hotel for a conference. Brand. New. This shining black tower of decadence had been decorated only a few months before I got there. It had all the ambiance of a freshly vacuumed rental car. In time it would wear Vegas, or vice versa, but for now: it was the new, gormless kid on the block. So imagine my surprise when, on the last day of my stay, I was tormented all night long by something that turned on the jets in my hot tub, stomped heavily to and fro every time I turned the lights out, and, eventually, after I told the room audibly to ""cut it out, I've got an early flight,"" slammed a shaking blow into the headboard directly beside me to remind me who had seniority in this place. In the morning, I confessed to the front desk I'd had a bit of an exciting night, and not in the usual Vegas way. With a glance at the room number, the clerk said he bet that I had. Later, I found out the brand new hotel had only been a few weeks old when a man had jumped to his death from one of the rooms; the stylish glass balconies I'd enjoyed were an aftermarket part, designed to keep other tortured guests from following suit. Unclear if my room had been the unlucky suite. Unclear if my room was like that because the man had jumped, or if the man had jumped because my room was like that. So: that's The Shining. I'm sure I'm the last person in the world to have read the book (I haven't seen the film still, but now I will), but better late than never, right? Sucks to shine in a hotel hungry for it, I guess."
The Shining,"“Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” When I first read The Shining a number of years ago I thought it was fantastic and gave it 5 stars, but it just never ranked as a personal favourite. On this reread, however, my socks were well and truly blown off and I had an entirely different experience. This is why I will always be a huge advocate for rereading - it’s quite apparent that wherever your head is at, or whatever life circumstances you find yourself in, can really impact how you view a book. As if that isn’t obvious. On my first read, I was impatient. I was just starting to read King, I wanted the SCARY BITS. This time around I was emotionally involved. I felt a deep connection to Danny and I could really tap into Wendy’s fears as a parent. A younger, more naive me would have thought “why don’t you just fucking leave if all this creepy shit is happening?” - well, until the snow storm at least - but now I can appreciate this as a last chance saloon for the Torrances. They needed the money, they really had nothing else to go back to. The Shining is surely one of King’s scariest, if not THE scariest - a few scenes in Pet Sematary might rival this title. One scene in particular left me feeling claustrophobic and breathless, and I regretted reading it one night before bed when I was home alone. I love that there’s so much history to the Overlook and that the former guests continue to hang around... Jack’s descent into madness is terrifying. He is a complex character and it is difficult to know whether we are to sympathise with him or not. He’s far from a perfect father, but we are all flawed in our ways - just maybe not to this extreme. I shed a little tear towards the end, because I think in spite of all he has done, he does love his son - he was just the perfect prey for the Overlook to get its claws into. I thoroughly LOVED this reread, and also the extra prologue and epilogue this edition has. The prologue in particular is something you should seek out if you’re a fan of The Shining - it really added another layer of history. 5 stars. Reread November 2023 on big King chronological reread. Still 5 stars."
The Shining,"Reread for my Horror Group Challenge & another Group Ghost Walk Challenge * 4.5 Stars I'm not sure why I only saw the movie and never read the book. I loved the movie so much it makes no sense, but back in the day, not many things make sense to me. I will have to go back and watch the movie again to see all of the different little changes. Now I know why some things happened. You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part. Wow! I know the book messed with my head but I didn't realize it would make me write that way! I hope anyone reading this can understand what I meant. I really did enjoy the book, although I did feel a bit crazier than I am at times with all of the voices in everyone's head! :) I didn't want one of the bad things that happened in the movie to NOT happen in the book. I didn't want to read that part and lo and behold, it didn't happen! Yay! The ending in the book was a lot better than the movie. Once again, I really did enjoy this book and look forward to reading and re-reading more of the golden oldies! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾 BLOG:"

The Shining,"This book was like a slow claustrophobic squeeze around my neck; I can definitely see why this book from KING is his most classic one yet. I really enjoyed the way he tackled difficult subjects— abuse, alcoholism, a difficult marriage, and mixes them with horror elements; it was definitely a deep dive read. You can watch the liveshow for my overall thoughts but here are my short general thoughts on the book overall: was lovely. Too cute sometimes. This smol bb boy literally stomped his tiny foot and said to the mean nasty ol' Overlook: . He didn't say that last part. Heavily implied though. . What a character. One moment you hate him. Like bitch. He needs therapy. Well, the whole family, honestly. The next, maybe you'll sympathize with him. Or not. Either way, King has a way of writing such characters with really complex layers that really gives them a definite look over. . My girl suffered through with this shit. Homegirl barely got it through with all the misogyny, constantly sexualized, that rough toxic masculinity shit, all the ghosts and demons thrown at her. Me shouting out through the entire book: This man carried this whole fucking book on his back if you asked me. The only person of color in this book that really changed and saved the whole story for all of us. Imagine if there were more POC here. The Overlook wouldn't even stand a chance. The blatant and completely unnecessary uses of the n word and other racist dialogue. King is white. Took too much of a liberation with this and really made me uncomfortable and took me out of the story a few times. I understand it takes place in the 70s. The sexual depictions of pretty much every female character in this book. The male gaze was strong with this one. Eurgh. . Me: ahahAhaHaHah— what? Edward Scissorhands could let me tell you. Overall a good solid read. Not too scary though. Watch the The Late Night Book Club Liveshow here: | | |"
The Shining,"""He sat down on one of the stools and propped his elbows on the bar’s leather-cushioned edge. At his left hand was a bowl for peanuts – now empty, of course. The first bar he’d been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry – just his luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him, and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his belly to his throat to his mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold."" - Stephen King, A lot of terrifying things occur in . None of them are as terrifying as the excruciating battle fought between the ears of an alcoholic. Stephen King’s novel is a classic ghost story; it is also a painful portrait of a man’s mental breakdown. That man is Jack Torrance, a gifted writer who has squandered his talent with booze and a bad temper. He and his family – wife Wendy, young son Danny – are wintering at the Overlook, a hotel in the Colorado mountains with a long and checkered past. Jack has been given a job as the caretaker of the Overlook. It’s his last chance to make good after losing a teaching position at a prestigious prep school. All he has to do is keep the rooms heated, provide basic upkeep, and make minor repairs. He thinks the job will give him plenty of time to finish the play he has been laboring on. The only trick is the isolation. Once the snows move in, they will make the winding mountain roads impassable. The Overlook will be cut off. It’s the perfect spot to do some writing, go homicidally crazy, or both. The genius of is the simplicity of its setting. Isolated location. Spirit infested living accommodations. Precocious child. All these story elements are exceedingly familiar. Layered onto this foundation is King’s exploration of Jack’s increasingly fragile psyche. King is at the height of his powers in his evocation of Jack. He makes visceral the taste of crushed aspirin, the piercing headaches, the desperate thirst for a drink. Jack is a complex character, at once a loving husband, a doting father, a grade-A prick, and a self-destructive wreck. King is known for outsized epics with dozens of characters. Here, he pares things down to four main players. Besides Jack there are Wendy, Danny, and Dick Hallorann, the Overlook’s chef. King cleverly utilizes a third-person limited viewpoint, which allows him a tell the story through several eyes, giving him the ability to both widen and narrow the focus at his whim. After Jack, Danny is the most important figure. He has “the shine”, a kind of ESP that includes mental telepathy, sensitivity to the paranormal, mind reading, and the gift of prophecy. (The ability to predict the future is not his best talent, though. If it was, the story would have turned out differently). Danny’s abilities allow him to perceive the danger of the Overlook Hotel – and its poisonous effect on his father – long before anyone else. I think King’s major achievement is the way he grounds the weirdness in reality. He is methodical in building this limited world (the Overlook, the town of Sidewinder) and sketching its handful of characters. His plotting takes a bit of time, but there is a reason. Take, for instance, an early scene in which Jack and Wendy take Danny to a psychiatrist. The upshot is that the psychiatrist gives a mushy-mumbly diagnosis of Danny’s “special” abilities that momentarily soothes his parents. It’s a scene that could easily have been excised, since it’s clear the doctor is wrong, and it’s obvious that Danny’s abilities are beyond rational explanation. The value of keeping it, though, is that it more firmly roots the proceedings in the actual world. Eventually, King cuts loose and unleashes all manner of insanity. Some of it, frankly, is a bit goofy. However, all the work he has done setting up his endgame paid off. I believed so much that I didn't bat an eye once the hotel came – for lack of a better phrase – to life. is a slow simmering tale that eventually explodes in the unrestrained violence and gore that has made King wealthy beyond imagining. (Of course, compared to some of his other titles, is practically subtle). The ending is something that is foreshadowed early on; unlike the producers of , I will not spoil it for those who’ve managed to avoid learning it. I’m not sure I’m a huge fan of how King concludes things, but I liked the lead-up so much that I can let that pass. I appreciated the slow turning of the screws, the gradual accretion of detail, the building of tension before it all boils over. I suppose a brief mention of Kubrick’s famous movie version is in order. I’ve heard that King hated it, and I can totally see why. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance as already half-crazy by the time the title card is shown. It’s hard to take his portrayal seriously when his eyes are screaming from the very first scene. The film version of Jack Torrance is an exercise in Jack Nicholson seeing if he can out-Jack Nicholson himself. (He does). I like Kubrick’s , for its formal brilliance if nothing more. The novel, as is often the case, is far superior. The book version of Jack Torrance is far different from his cinematic shadow. He begins as a deeply flawed man with an ugly past, a serious addiction, and a nasty streak a mile wide. But he is also a man who loves – or believes he loves – his wife and child. You see flashes of a good man, a man you don’t want to see destroyed. The erosion of Jack’s mind and soul is ’s narrative backbone. King paints an indelible portrait. Jack chewing Excedrin after Excedrin. Jack wiping his lips till they bleed. Jack trying to distract himself from the thought of a drink. Jack trying to reconcile the man he wanted to be with the man he has demonstrated to the world. This is a fully realized and unforgettable character. It’s an accomplishment, and a testament to King’s skill. A skill, perhaps, that is sometimes overlooked. I am slowly making my way through Stephen King’s extensive canon. So far, my favorite has been , where King uses a ghoulish conceit (an Indian burial ground that can bring the dead back to life) to explore a very real human concern (loss and grief). He touched such powerful chords with that book that I hesitate to ever open it again. It’s becoming very clear to me that King is a genius. An artist of the first order. Not just a top-notch storyteller. Not just a guy with an incredible imagination. But a bona fide literary master. He writes things that you read and don’t forget, ever. A lot of wacky and macabre things happen at the Overlook during the course of . The tension, the shocks, the slow revelation of the lurking terror, are all things that will keep you turning pages with increasing rapidity. It is also the reason that (along with King’s other works) is so obviously translatable to film. But the reason this is unforgettable is the framework that King builds upon. The horror of the supernatural is not nearly so deep and so dread as that which passes between flawed human beings."
The Shining,"When MC Johnny is in the haunted mountain hotel house, twins can raise their axes and sway to the beat of the barkeepers´ whispering background vibe Maybe just so popular because of the movie I´ve read a ton of Kings´ novels, some already 2 times, and must say that this is a good, but by far not one of his best works. It has some freaking labyrinth, bathroom, parenting, and insanity axe murder moments, but besides that, there is much less terror, paranormal activity, and horror than one would expect and hope for. One could call it subtle and slowly accelerating in suspense and action, but subjectively it´s just not unleashing its full potential. Its close to only focus is on going insane in an isolated place and thereby facing ones´ demons, talking with ghosts, and self-doubt. I honestly even was a bit disappointed, because I know the better, harder, and far cooler King who switches perspectives, has big picture scenes, and much more badass characters than just stumbling fathers with alcohol problems. Many autobiographical undertones in the horror hotel There is so much personal King in this, his fear of wasps, not liking a kid, being a writer and substance abuser, probably even some relationship problems, especially in combination with the mentioned bad parenting and being high as heck tendencies. Not sure about that, he mentioned other inspirations in interviews, prefaces, and lectures, but because of his tendency to kind of use writing as a self reflection and therapy session, one can assume that there might have been the one or other epic Tabitha vs Stephen battle or King vs his kids, especially his son, that laid the groundwork. Psi powers penetrate mental sanity Going insane in the membrane on a wacky holiday trip has never been so much fun, especially because the issues and frustrations of the main protagonist are the foundation for escalation towards total bonkers status. A stable, happy person might have found a better way to deal with career and relationship problems, but that would have been a pretty boring attempt and not half as cool as good old letting the anger out before it hurts the hater, instead leaving everyone else as a victim or dead. That´s much better for the salvation of the ones that also caused the whole mess. Alternative family therapy, anger management, bonding, and teambuilding methods No matter what the friendlier, calmer approaches might tell, some in you face methods of innovative, new therapeutic schools recommend just unleashing ones´ anger, maybe accompanied by visualizing ones´ demons until they manifest as if they are real and give more, even greater tips and tricks to handle the situation. How much could be real? With all that quantum, parallel universe, time travel, extra dimension stuff, one really doesn´t know what will come out in centuries or millennia when 4567 scientists will use their instruments to find correlations between physics, death, haunted place, and possibly even souls, demons, and damned sex succubi. Maybe we just haven´t figured out how to construct the right equipment to see that we are surrounded by myriads of emanating reminiscences of billions of years of evolution and trillions of immortal, multi dimensional consciences that are created with each physical body. Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique"
The Shining,"This is basically just another haunted house story...but my, such a great one, Stephen King brings all his considerable talents into view. Though his tendency to overwrite shows too, a little editing would have made it even better by cutting out superfluous pages, nothing wrong in being succinct . If you like ghouls, strange apparitions , an atmosphere thick with foreboding this ride will satisfy, not to mention the continuous party in the Colorado Lounge, where drinks are on the house, with Lloyd the perpetually agreeable gentleman presiding ... A vague bartender who knows how to mix them, wild, crazy , raucous ""people"" inside, and noisy scenes happening frequently, sounds like fun...Now to begin, John ""Jack"" Torrance has a little drinking problem, a falling down drunk, to be honest, it wouldn't matter much to anyone, except he is married with a lovely wife Wendy and a good son Danny age five, he the kid, sees things though...which becomes a problem later on. The parents are in their late twenties, Jack has recently lost his job teaching at a prep school , an English instructor in New England, very appropriate. What is not, beating up a spoiled rich student damaging his old car, Jack has a bad temper obviously , and gives no mercy. Let go by the school he desperately needs another job quickly, this is where the ancient Overlook Hotel, in the high Rocky Mountains of Colorado, over 10,000 feet in elevation, becomes important. Jack's best friend Albert Shockley a wealthy man, obtains him the caretaker position there in the winter, he is part owner and fellow lush. A new start for the aspiring writer; five months in isolation with only his rattled family , the roads become impassable because of heavy snows, often blizzards strike the area, Mr. Torrance has the time now to finish his play, that will solve all the difficulties. Nevertheless the Overlook has other ideas not so nice, room 217 for instance, nor is it the only one , the sinister hotel elevator disturbs the occupants, a free spirit , which makes a quite chilling situation there. The three humans in the creepy building, months alone, can cause some to become unbalanced, even maniacal, as the temperature drops and the snowflakes fall, tense Wendy feels uneasy... Terrific novel and the little child, Daniel (Danny) his invisible, unearthly friend, the aloof Tony , dominates the preceding, they are rather a peculiar pair... good or bad is the question, the answer... read the book. However in reality and shall I write these words...the fiendish Overlook Hotel is the star."
The Shining,"Another Stephen King re-read complete! I have had this book marked at 4 stars since I added it a few years ago. It has probably been 20 years since I last read the book and, in that time, I have watched the Kubrick movie a few times. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of the Kubrick movie (and I hear King wasn’t either). I think my thoughts on the movie combined with being a couple of decades removed from reading it skewed my rating a bit low. This time, though, with the refresher – 5 stars all the way! Definitely classic King, and maybe one of the most perfect monster/ghost stories ever written. One very important thing I think that people forget (including me) is I listened to the book this time and the audio narration was great. I was enthralled the entire time and the narrator did a great job raising the stakes as the story progressed. If you are also considering a re-read, the audiobook is a great option. If you are a King fan and haven’t read this, you should! If you are looking for a place to start King, this is not a bad choice. It is a little more psychologically complex that a couple of the other titles I recommend as King starting points ( and ), but definitely would give anyone a good feel for King. While there are some elements in the book similar to the movie, forget everything you have seen and the impressions Kubrick has given you and try the book. I think you will find it to be a vastly improved experience. Also, I hear the more recent mini-series is much more true to the book – I hope to hunt that one down, soon!"
The Shining,"Ok, Mr. Jack Torrence,..... ..... The man who was going to live by his wits....be a best selling author, acclaimed playwright and winner of the New York critics award, man of letters, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, .....you killed my appetite ..... I’ll never be able to look at a Triscuit cracker again without thinking of “The Shining”, .... let alone eat one. You, Sir, took the joy out of crunching those little squares. Haha! Great characters- storytelling- thriller by a master. Yep... I can see why readers get hooked on King. Huge thanks to Zoey!!!!!! I’m so glad I read this!!! An adrenaline rush!!!!! Off for a long Sat. morning hike - starting in 31 degrees. Geee... this is California!"
The Shining,"“You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I’m sixty years old this January.” “Huh?” “You got a knack,” Hallorann said, turning to him. “Me, I’ve always called it shining. That’s what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without even openin our mouths.” The Shining is a story about the Torrance family. Jack, his wife Wendy and their five year old son, Danny. Jack is hired as the caretaker at the remote Overlook Hotel for the winter season. He is informed by the hotel manager that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, killed his entire family inside the hotel. Specifically, that Grady “murdered his two little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and then committed suicide.” As Jack later learns, the Overlook has a long and terrible history. Over the years, it has housed illicit affairs, horrible murders, and mob style executions. Nonetheless, Jack is determined to be the caretaker. In the past, Jack, an aspiring writer and former school teacher has struggled with alcohol and anger issues. Once, he accidentally broke his son’s arm while trying to discipline him. More recently, Jack assaulted a student when he caught him letting the air out of his tires. The incident cost Jack his teaching job and almost his marriage. Jack, now a recovering alcoholic and working on a play, hopes that the seclusion of the Overlook will help him finish the play and reconnect with his wife and son. But the Overlook Hotel has other ideas. The longer the Torrance family stays, the more haunting and powerful it becomes….. So, obviously this is Stephen King at his very best. Every chapter leaves you wanting more, and every sentence in this book is outstanding. Brilliantly written horror that is both magical and terrifying with fully developed characters that are equal parts innocent, vulnerable and pure evil! The Overlook hotel, is a living nightmare, its bricks and mortar soaked through with past horrors. The creepy hedge animals, the old fashioned fire extinguisher: a coiled snake ready to strike, the sounds of a party echoing through the empty rooms and halls, the boiler, unstable and dangerous. The imagery playing through my mind was magnificent! The Shining is an absolute masterpiece. A must read classic. Highly recommend 🙌🏻"
The Shining,"All the stars! Loved, loved this book! I'm not sure what to say in this review that hasn't been said by others. I was blown away by how great this book was. It was so much better then the movie! The slow progression of insanity with Jack Torrance was one of the best things about this book. I loved the overall menacing presence of The Overlook. I loved how the hotel becomes more violent and threatening to Danny and his family the longer they stay there. It was so gripping and overwhelming as the story unfolded. You just couldn't quit reading! I enjoyed Danny's struggle as a kid with understanding his 'gifts' and how to use them in a positive way. Danny, don't you dare go into room 217! This whole book was just awesome! This review doesn't give this book justice for how great it is. I recommend this book to Stephen King fans and horror lovers."
The Shining,"It’s interesting how at different times in life very different things stand out about this story. What’s scary changes with time, I suppose. “This inhuman place makes human monsters.” When I was a kid way too young for reading King, the hotel was the scariest thing ever. On later rereads I was feeling the pain of Jack’s struggle with addiction, trying to overcome it but instead spiraling towards destruction and the relentless hounding of the Overlook. And now it’s Jack himself who freaks the living hell out of me — . The hotel and its ghosts did not have to work too hard to reduce Jack to his entitled base impulses, did they? Jack Torrance goes through life angrily counting the wrongs done to him, minimizing - willingly or subconsciously - his own contribution to his misery, with Overlook just adding to the blind rage that eventually takes him over, a logical conclusion to that hair-trigger temper and abusive tendencies of his. . And yet, even with me terrified of Jack ever since the first few pages of that simmering and initally pretty hidden rage I still cannot help but feel for him, for his doomed efforts to be better, for his love of his son, for his absolutely shitty luck of ending up in the worst place possible for him. King’s Jack Torrance is a wonderfully complex guy, far from the immediate crazy-eyed-insane of Jack Nicholson in Kubrick’s adaptation (and sadly, the image of Jack that most people have). ————— This book was when I first realized back at twelve with a few King books under my belt already that Uncle Stevie is way more disturbing when he hints at things rather than being overtly graphic. . Jack’s rocque mallet is almost a relief after that chapter where he’s almost unsure whether the topiary is moving, and Danny finding out what’s in room 217 is less scary than that sense outside of the room that the fire hydrant hose is about to grab him. It’s the slow dreadful anticipation rather than jump scares that always did it for me. And this book yet again proves to me that even reread with older eyes its one more stone in King’s pedestal among great modern writers. Seriously, chuck some Hemingway out of literature courses and add instead, dear professors. —————— Also posted on ."
The Shining,"His best book is 'The Green Mile,' but since it doesn't quite fall under the Horror category, it is either 'Shining' or 'Carrie' which take top prize. There is not one single detriment to this well-known tale of the disintegration of the American family within the realm of the undead. King here is as he has never been since: metaphoric and concise. He usually adds fact upon useless fact that converts a 400 page work into something more gargantuan, and, therefore, less enthralling. King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why. His story is about the build up of tension, the ""shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans. The boiler burns, blows everything up just as Jack Torrence forgets his humanity & becomes an ego/id complex. His selfishness & his alcoholism (a hereditary illness... another theme about family ""curses,"" and weak threads) leads to savagery. The ghosts are the manifestations of a child's bruised home-life and the suffocation and claustrophobia have more to do with that tragic past than the hotel's eerie interior. I place this masterpiece next to 'The Exorcist', a tale that is more than just a simple tale of demonic possession. To say the 'The Shining' is just a ghost story is something Kubrick ran with... completely ignoring the pathos of a family eating away at itself. The Torrences suffer because they had been broken prior to the stay at the Overlook... it seems that for this one all the stars aligned and all the ingredients for one of the most amazing horror stories of all time mixed exquisitely. This one is the one that made King king."
The Shining,"Thank you the King of author who has written something so memorable that I cannot help myself to reread and see his extraordinary creative mind who finds millions of ways to scare me sh*tless! Redrum Fire extinguishers Roque Mallet Mind freaking maze All work no play makes Jake dull boy! Creepy Grady twins Tricycle Scary woman in bath Room 237 Japanese lantern Here comes Johnny ( okay this part belongs to the movie to tribute Johnny Carson) Jack Torrance is totally satan, Overlook Hotel is last gate to the hell and little Danny speaks with the angels by communicating them using his finger ( that might be most biblical approach to the book but it makes more sense than conspiracy theories I’ve written) Overall: I think the authors has brilliant minds shine like brightest stars in the sky! Mr. King already earned to have his own planet!"
The Shining,"Constant Readers may well be surprised, but even after a second reading, this remains one of my least liked early Stephen King reads! This perception is also probably influenced by the far better and classic Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson movie, which I feel is more grounded and a lot less supernatural based than the book. A personal admission I should add for context, is that I find most ghost stories unfathomable because of their reality 'rules' often being bent ad-hoc to meet the needs of the story being told... just like in this book. 5.5 out of 12!"
The Shining,"Update 10/30/21: Wow… I’ve read this book four times now?! I don’t know what I wrote before, but it’s still a four-star read for me. It was interesting reading it in this weird post-Covidish time since it is heavy on themes of isolation and being quarantined off from the rest of the world. Happy Halloween everyone. Time to go take my medicine. ———————- Update 8/28/18: I completely agree with everything I said two years ago. Third time reading this one, and I think I enjoyed it the most this time around. Now it’s time to watch the movie and read Doctor Sleep. Kicking off a couple months of reading scary, autumny, Halloweeny books. ———————- Old school Stephen King, man. That's where it's at. This is a high point in the King canon for me. In Salem's Lot before this, he developed fascinating characters inhabited a beautifully described small town. He took his time slowly unraveling the story, taking pages and pages to build the setting and deepen our relationship with the large cast of characters. In The Shining, there are basically three characters outside of a small cast of supporting actors. The setting is really just a giant old hotel in a snowy Colorado town. But SK takes even more pages, sometimes entire blasted chapters to develop his characters and set his scenes. Like I said before, it's a slow burn, man. The fact that King takes his time building the horror makes the scary scenes that much scarier. It's not a horror novel full of jump scares and monsters. It's effective by drawing us deep into the minds of the characters, overhearing their innermost thoughts, and freaking out right along with them. The scenes there for horror effect and the iconic stuff from the movie aren't even all that necessary. There is so much else going on in the isolation, addition, desperation, schizophrenia of it all that plays so much harder on your emotions than what's hiding behind a hotel room door. It's long winded at times, sure, but it's mostly necessary. We get to know the Torrence family better than we wish we ever did by the end of this thing. From the awkwardness of the initial conversation with Jack and Ullman to the wild and crazy climax, the pages keep turning and your heart keeps pounding faster. King takes you on a long roller coaster ride that moves slowly up the long, high incline before bringing us crashing down screaming our faces off at the end. And then we grab another King book and hope the ride is just as thrilling as the one before. I'm looking at you, Doctor Sleep."
The Shining,"Even though the film version of this one from Stanley Kubrick is generally considered a horror classic, Stephen King has never been shy about making his dislike of it known. He hates it so much that he was heavily involved in making a more faithful adaptation of it as TV mini-series in 1997. (This inferior version invited comparisons of Stephen Weber from to one of Jack Nicholson’s most iconic performances. So that worked well….) Considering Uncle Stevie’s longstanding grudge about it, I was more than a little shocked when he recently made a of to accept the changes that the new TV show was making. I can’t quite wrap my head around why a genius director creating something new and brilliant based on his story is bad, but anything that a fairly shitty TV show does with the source material is A-OK with King? Whatever…. On to the book. As most everyone knows, this is about a family spending the winter in a haunted hotel in the Rocky Mountains called the Overlook. Jack Torrance was a teacher and promising writer, but his alcoholism and short temper wrecked his career and very nearly ended his marriage. Jack has been sober over a year, and he and Wendy have started down the path of reconciliation. However, she can never entirely forgive him for breaking the arm of their son Danny in an incident that was equal parts rage and accident. Five year old Danny has psychic mojo that includes reading thoughts and precognition courtesy of visions shown to him by his imaginary friend, Tony. Nearly broke, Jack takes on the job of being the winter caretaker for the Overlook. This means that the family will spend months alone in the hotel once the snow flies, and the last caretaker went axe-happy and killed his family. Unfortunately, the Overlook is like an emotional sponge that has soaked in every ugly act that ever took place within its rooms, and the presence of a high-powered psychic like Danny kicks the place into overdrive. As Jack is being driven into madness, Wendy and Danny become increasingly terrified of what he might do. I once read something in which King talked about denial of his own substance abuse problems in which he noted that he somehow wrote without ever once realizing he was describing his own alcoholism. That element of the Jack Torrence character is what makes this one of his better books. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with a bunch of ghosts is scary in a horror story kind of way. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with an ill-tempered drunk with a history of violence as he is cracking up is downright terrifying. Adding even more weight to that idea is that Jack Torrance isn’t a monster. He’s a troubled man who does love his wife and son, and he’s self-aware enough to realize that he’s on the brink. He’ll either turn his life around and earn his wife’s trust back, or he’ll give in to his own worst impulses. This would be hard enough under any circumstances, but under the influence of the evil spirits of the Overlook, Jack becomes a tragedy. Another element jumped out at me while re-reading this time. King talked in his non-fiction (Which I remember as being entertaining, but probably very dated by now. I would be very interested if Uncle Stevie wanted to take another look at what’s become of the horror genre since he wrote that one.) about the economic factor of and how a part of why the movie worked was that the family was essentially trapped by their finances. He uses that idea to good effect here. Most people would run screaming from the Overloook in less than a week, but we’re frequently reminded that the Torrance family was swirling the drain financially. If the perception is that Jack botched this job, his last chance to get back to a more stable lifestyle is probably shot and that goes a long way towards allowing him to convince himself and Wendy that they’re overreacting to the weird occurrences during the early stages, and by the time they’ve become snowed in, the Overlook has its hooks deep into Jack. It’s those more mundane things like a family struggling with money and that an evil entity turns one of them against the others by playing on his inherent weaknesses that make this one of my favorite King novels."
The Shining,"Once upon a time, there was a young man who believed that books were always better than movies. Everyone whose opinion he respected told him it was so, and he believed it must be. And for a time he saw nothing to shake this belief. He read Dickens and saw filmed versions and knew it was so. He read Dumas and no version of Musketeers could shake his conviction. , , and all bore this out. But the young man discovered that it wasn't just the classics for which this held true. He read the popular books of his day, the mysteries and science fictions and fantasies, and those were always better than the movie. But the inevitable happened. One day his notions were challenged in the most devastating way. A man, wild with isolated madness, chopped a door down, poked his head through the cracks and declared his frightening presence. It was an iconic moment. A new idol to replace the idol he'd worshipped, but he didn't know it yet. The young man went out to read the book that gave birth to that image, knowing that the book MUST be better than the film. He turned the pages with excitement, and it began as he expected it would. Tension built, suspense drove him on, the characters seemed fuller and richer, but that began to slip away. Where was the thematic depth? Where was the powerful iconography? Where was the terror? It was gone, and with it his notions. Suddenly there was a film that was better than the book. By a long distance. And it was happening everywhere around him. On screen Replicants beat their written counterparts. Russian poets in frozen manors moved him in ways the translated words couldn't. Christs made love to Magdalenes and it made him weep for joy. The truth was other. Rare though it remained, movies could be better than their sources. He would never again be the snob he'd been. He would embrace those films that trumped their books, and proclaim it to the world."
The Shining,"Actual rating: 4.25 🌟 Obviously this story is a famous one, which led to me not being all too surprised at the things that happened, but this doesn't mean that reading this book wasn't exciting and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. In fact, the suspense is spread in the right amount of doses throughout the book, which is something I would love to see more often. I read many stories where one thrilling thing happens after another, which just gets repetitive after awhile and takes away from the excitement. King, however, knows how to keep you hooked without ever going over the top. Despite my copy having over 600 pages, I felt entertained throughout and was never bored. This is how suspense is supposed to be written. Obviously, many strange things happen in this story. Many of them might even seem completely unbelievable and ridiculous. But once again, King has a way of writing that makes everything sound like they could actually happen. I don't know how he does it, but every time I read something by him I think to myself:""Yeah sure, of course this is plausible. Of course this can be a thing."" No matter how out of this world the plot may seem. I really liked how every character in this book had a distinctive voice, even though there were many changes of the point of view. This shows what great and realistic characters Stephen King creates every time. Especially the main character Jack struck a chord with me, even though I am nothing like him. But there was just something about him...I don't know how to describe it, but he was written in a way that made all his actions seem somehow comprehensible, no matter how shocking they might have been. Of course everybody reads a book differently and interprets it in their own way. For me, this wasn't just a simple ghost story. For me, it was about a man coming to terms with his own demons more than ever before, and finally facing up to something he has lost control over a long time ago. The only reason this book doesn't get the full five stars from me, is because I didn't get lost in this world as much as I did in the other works by the same author."
The Shining,more like a 3.5 but hey ho
The Shining,"A spine tingling 5 stars and a book worthy in the hall of fame, horrifying yes but also a book that goes beyond horror. A book that leaves sentiment at the door and embraces strong themes of child abuse, alcoholism and the psychological unravelling of a man, a father, a husband, and writer, who is so affected by the very surroundings he sought solace from, he descends into one of the darkest nightmares as the ghostly macabre presence takes hold. A book that evokes such strong emotions it held my attention for the entire novel without deviation. Jack is a recovering alcoholic who takes on a caretaker role at the Outlook hotel in the Colorado Rockies at the end of a season to help him recover from writer’s block and an uncontrolled rage that cost him his teaching job and alcoholism that almost cost him his life and marriage. However, events start to distract Jack when his five-year-old son, who possesses ‘The Shining’ and psychic abilities to read minds, has sightings of the people who once inhabited the hotel. Unable to possess Danny the supernatural forces within the hotel play havoc with Jack’s fragile mental state and with the return to alcohol, he descends into a dark mental abyss where the violence takes hold as Jack takes an axe to the bathroom door in that iconic scene of Jack Nicolson. “Sometimes human places, create inhuman monsters.” The scene is set – Just. Now to the atmospheric backdrop of the book. A worthy accompaniment to this chilling story. The snow bound hills, the hotels expanse, the topiary hedges that come to life, the hotels décor, the basement and even the carpets illicit a specific mention to create a perfect setting for terror to take hold. And then the sounds and the eerie drum beat of a murderous message with the rhythmic repetition of 'red rum, red rum, red rum, red rum….' designed to penetrate your psyche. Two words when combined and reversed (REDRUM) spells MURDER. Just genius. The ghostly incidents never seemed too terrifying on their own but when combined with a character that is unhinged, volatile and recovering from alcoholism then we are faced with one unholy picture of horror. I watched the film years ago and decided to read the book, and it will be no surprise to learn like many others I much preferred the book. To test this notion, I watched the film again and still hold the same opinion, the book did more to create feelings of horror, isolation and fear. So would I recommend? The answer is yes totally!! With such psychologically complex and tragic characters, shocking unsettling events, the perfect tempo in storytelling, the wonderful atmospheric setting with its rhythmic adage of ‘REDRUM’ create a masterpiece in horror that has stood the test of time. Horror is not my go to genre, so I had to ask one of my Goodreads friends Michael (Never ending TBR) for his recommendation in horror for beginners like me!!! Thank you, Michael. Perfect choice, I loved it."
The Shining,"The Shining (The Shining #1) Stephen King Past horrors and evil lurk in Colorado's Overlook Hotel, threatening winter season caretakers Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their young son, Danny. Gifted with the shining, a clairvoyant Danny must battle the darkest evil in the remote hotel in an attempt to save his family from its influence. The Overlook Hotel claimed the most beautiful physical setting of any resort in the world; but Jack Torrance, the new winter caretaker, his wife Wendy and their five-year-old son Danny saw much more than its splendor. Jack saw the Overlook as an opportunity, a desperate way back from failure and despair; Wendy saw this lonely sanctuary as a frail chance to preserve their family; and Danny?... Danny, who was blessed or cursed with a shinning, precognitive gift, saw visions hideously beyond the comprehension of a small boy. He sensed the evil coiled within the Overlook's one hundred and ten empty rooms; an evil that was waiting just for them. عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «درخ‍ش‍ش‌»؛ «درخشان»؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ف‍ن‌ ک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز یازدهم ماه اکتبر سال2000میلادی عنوان: درخ‍ش‍ش‌؛ نویسنده: اس‍ت‍ف‍ن‌ ک‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ ب‍رگ‍ردان‌ ب‍ه‍ن‍ام‌ دی‍ان‍ی‌؛ تهران، نشر البرز، سال1378؛ در624ص؛ شابک9644421558؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20م عنوان: درخشش؛ نویسنده استفان کینگ؛ مترجم غلامحسین اعرابی؛ تهران، پلیکان، سال1390؛ در648ص؛ شابک9786005915150؛ عنوان: درخشان‫: علم غیب؛ نویسنده: استیفن کینگ‫؛ مترجم لیلا شاپوریان؛ تهران، نشر قطره، سال1391؛ در711ص؛ شابک9786001196034؛ چاپ دوم تهرن: کتابسرای میردشتی: نشر قطره؛ سال1400؛ در708ص؛ شابک9786227546040؛ نویسنده‌ای جویای نام «جک تورنس» میخواهد زندگی خانوادگی، و شغلی خویش را از نو بسازد؛ «جک» که شغل آموزگاری در مدرسه‌ ی پیش‌ دانشگاهی «ورمونت» را، پس از یورش به یک دانش‌آموز، از دست داده، مشتاقانه سرایداری زمستانی هتل کوهستانی پرت «اوورلوک» را میپذیرد، و امیدوار است تا بتواند، در آن مکان دور افتاده، ارتباطی نو با خانواده‌ ی خویش ـ همسر و پسرش ـ برقرار کند، و به نگارش نمایش‌نامه‌ ی تازه ای نیز بپردازد؛ «دنی» پسر پنج ساله‌ ی «جک» که به برهان موهبتی خدادادی، از توانایی ویژه ای برخوردار است، پس از نقل مكان به هتل «اوورلوک»، درمییابد تصاوير و ارواحی در هتل وجود دارند؛ با بارش برف سنگین، و بسته شدن راه‌های ارتباطی، رویدادهایی رخ میدهند، که افراد خانواده را دچار مشکل میکنند و...؛ سالها پیش از امروز خوانش این کتاب مرا مدهوش کرد نقل از متن: (قسمت اول: مطالب مقدماتی: 1- مصاحبه ی شغلی؛ «جک تورنس» با خود گفت: مردک بدذات!؛ «اولمان» با قد پنج فوت و پنج اینچ ایستاده بود، و وقتی حرکت کرد، حرکتش چنان خشک و شتابان بود، که به نظر میرسید این ویژگیِ همه ی مردان کوچولوی گرد و قلنبه است؛ موهایش مرتب بود، و لباس تیره رنگش، که سنگین ولی راحت بود، باعث میشد مشتری احساس کند، میتواند مشکلات خود را با او در میان بگذارد؛ با لحن تندی با کارگران صحبت میکرد: باید کارتان را درست انجام بدهید؛ روی برگردان یقه اش، گل میخک قرمزی زده بود؛ شاید برای اینکه در خیابان «استوارت» کسی او را با مامور کفن و دفن محلی اشتباه نگیرد وقتی «جک» سخنان «اولمان» را شنید، با خودش فکر کرد که با این اوضاع، لازم نیست علاقه ای به هیچ کدام از افراد آن طرف میز داشته باشد «اولمان» سئوالی مطرح کرد، ولی او منظورش را نفهمید؛ «اولمان» از آن مردانی بود که چنین خطاهایی را برای رسیدگی بعدی در دفتر راهنمای شخصی ذهنشان بایگانی میکنند ببخشید؟ پرسیدم آیا همسر و پسرتان دقیقا میدانند شغل شما در اینجا چیست؟ نگاهی به پرسشنامه ای که مقابلش بود انداخت و گفت: پسرتان دانیل و همسرتان از این کار وحشتی ندارند؟ وندی زن فوق العاده ای است پسرتان هم فوق العاده است؟ جک لبخند زد، لبخندی به پهنای صورتش؛ ما دوست داریم اینطور فکر کنیم؛ در مقایسه با بقیه ی پسربچه های پنجساله، کاملاً متکی به خود است اولمان دیگر لبخند نزد؛ پرسشنامه ی «جک» را در پرونده اش گذاشت، و پرونده را به کشو برگرداند؛ میز تحریر کاملاً خالی بود، و فقط یک کاغذخشک کن، یک تلفن، یک چراغ مطالعه، و یک سبد مخصوص نامه های وارده و صادره، روی آن بود، که نامه ای هم در آن نبود اولمان برخاست و به طرف کمد بایگانیِ گوشه ی اتاق رفت، و گفت: آقای «تورنس»، اگر مایلید نزدیک میز تحریر بیایید، تا نگاهی به کارها بیندازیم؛ پنج ورقه ی بزرگ آورد، و آنها را روی چوب گردوی کاملاً براق میز تحریر گذاشت؛ «جک» بوی ادوکلن «اولمان» را استشمام کرد، و شانه به شانه ی او ایستاد؛ بدون هیچ دلیلی، به فکرش خطور کرد، که تمام مردان یا اصلاً ادوکلن نمیزنند، یا «انگلیش لدر» میزنند، و مجبور شد زبانش را بین دندانهایش فشار بدهد، تا جلوی خنده ی خود را بگیرد؛ از پشت دیوار صداهایی از آشپزخانه میآمد، که مربوط به فعالیتهای ساعت ناهار هتل «اوورلوک» بود اولمان به سرعت شروع به صحبت کرد: بالاترین طبقه، اتاق زیرشیروانی است؛ فعلاً آنجا چیزی نیست به جز یک م��ت خرت و پرت؛ «اوورلوک» بعد از جنگ جهانی دوم، بارها دست به دست شده است، و به نظر میرسد، مدیرانی که پشت سر هم آمده اند، چیزهای زیادی را در اتاق زیرشیروانی گذاشته اند؛ من میخواهم آنجا تله موش بگذارم، و اطراف آن را سمپاشی کنم؛ بعضی از زنهای مستخدم طبقه ی سوم، از آنجا صدای خش خش شنیده اند؛ من باور نمیکنم، ولی حتی یک درصد امکان وجود موش را هم، نباید در هتل نادیده گرفت؛ البته شما که در هیچ وضعیتی اجازه نمیدهید پسرتان به اتاق زیرشیروانی برود جک گفت: نه؛ بعد دوباره نیشش باز شد و با خود فکر کرد: عجب حرف مزخرفی؛ آیا این مردک احمق واقعا فکر میکرد او اجازه میدهد پسرش در اتاق زیرشیروانی که پر از خرت و پرت، تله موش و خدا میداند چه چیزهای دیگری است، پرسه بزند؟ اولمان نقشه ی اتاق زیرشیروانی را به سرعت برداشت، زیر بقیه ی کاغذها گذاشت، و با صدایی دانشمندانه گفت: «اوورلوک» یک صدوده مهمانپذیر دارد، سی تای آن که سوئیت هستند، در طبقه ی سوم قرار دارد؛ ده تا -از جمله سوئیت ریاست جمهوری- در قسمت غربی است، ده تا در وسط، ده تای دیگر در قسمت شرقی؛ ناگفته نماند که همه ی آنها به منظره های باشکوهی مشرف هستند جک با خود فکر کرد بگوید، ممکن است لطفا تبلیغات فروش را کنار بگذارید؟!

The Shining,"QUESTION: Is Stephen King the BEST PURE STORYTELLER of the 20th Century ? ANSWER: Who knows...I haven’t got the slightest wisp of the faintest fragment of a lingering shadow of a clue how to answer that manwich-sized question. However, I do think that in order to have a credible debate on the subject, you would need to include the Prince of the Prolific Page Turner in the argument. That says something to me and it got me thinking that there is a lot to like (and even love) about much of King’s work. Calm down King haters, this is not going to be a slobbering “rah rah” session, but I do think some due is due to Mr. King and his extensive literary production. But, first, a little background. Like many, I read a lot of King’s early novels when I was a prepubescent and post pubescent teenager and enjoyed them a lot at the time. I mean they had lots of naughty words and naughty people doing naughty things (sometimes to their naughty bits)...what’s not to love sports fans. During that period I read quite a few Kingers including: ,,,, (OUCH on this epic failure),, and. However, after the (more on that series below), I drifted away from reading in general as other things began to take precedence in my advancing teen years...namely... This period of literary latency lasted about 15 years (though I did still read during this time, but it was very sporatic). Then about 7 years ago, I began hard core reading again like a born again bibliophile. This hot, steamy love of books soon blossomed into an uncontrollable addiction once I joined Goodreads (YES, THAT MAKES ALL OF YOU READING THIS ENABLERS!!!). Well, once I reattached myself to the reading world, my primary King-related focus was completing the Dark Tower series in all its delicious awesomeness. Okay, so after finishing the Dark Tower for the 2nd time (I am currently up to book 4 on my 3rd go around with the Dark Tower Group here on GR), I decided to read some of King’s later works that I missed as well as go back and revisit the stories I read as a teenager (to see how they hold up to the memory of my hormonally controlled younger self). Which brings us to the Shining which was first up on my re-read list and I am happy to say that I found this more enjoyable this time around. Most of this is due to subtle and nuanced psychological aspects of the novel dealing with alcohlism, obsession and madness were more understandable and relatable at 40 than they were at 15 (go figure). I also found myself thinking of this story as a pretty good microcosm of King’s work (both the good and the bad) as it contained many of King's strength and weaknesses. While I assume most people are familiar with the plot, for those just returning to Earth (welcome back) or just arriving for the first time (NaNu..NaNu), the plot centers around aspiring writer Jack Torrance who has accepted the job of winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel (aka…the most EVIL place on Earth). Now, Jackie boy is a charmer. He is a “not so recovering” alcoholic with serious ""pole up the poop shoot"" anger issues and a MEGATRON-sized problem with authority. Basically, he is your basic angry, violent, anti-social drunk...let's go ahead and call him DADDY. Accompanying Daddy to the OverSPOOK Hotel are his wife, Wendy, and their “clairvoyant” son Danny, whose unique ability is called The Shining. Now Daddy is hoping to use the quiet time at the OverKOOK to help suture his relationship with his family which, oddly enough, has been on the downslide since Daddy broke Danny’s arm during some drunken shenanigans. UH, I don’t think I need to tell you that things do not go well for Daddy or his family once they come under the influence of the Over""Look we just want to kill you"" Hotel. I think I will exit the plot summary and leave the rest for you to find on your own. I really liked the story. King does a great job of creating a superb sense of dread with sides of creepy and crawly in this very unique and layered ""haunted house"" story. For all of King’s less than perfect prose, his occassional LONG ""off the plot"" tangents and a few endings that leave something to be desired...like a good ending... for all of that SK is an extraordinary story-teller. He is among the best ever at being able to suck a reader into his story and the Shining is certainly a great example of that as I was lost in the narrative from the very beginning. There are few writers who can completing yank me into a story and have me forgeting about eating and sleeping like King did here. For example, I was listening to the audio version of this novel (narrated very well by actor Campbell Scott) and I have rarely had 16+ hours of an audio book sail by as fast as this one did. Now understand, I thought the story was very good but was nowhere near loving it. Yet, I found myself listening to it almost straight through, because King has some demon-spawned story-telling mojo that hypnotizes me. Oddly enough, an hour after I finished the story I was actually somewhat unfulfilled…it’s like the book is some form of literary Chinese food. Regardless, while I was listening I was captivated and this seems to be one of King’s gifts. The ability to create characters that engage the reader (both good and bad) and finding the right emotional buttons to press in order to make the reader CARE about what his characters are thinking and doing. King certainly succeeds here and is in top ""page turning"" form as he employs characters that are exceptionally well drawn, including the Hotel itself which is one of the best non-human characters ever. Overall, I think King has created a classic, yet unique “haunted house” story while at the same time including an engaging and evocative depiction of obsession, alcoholism and madness. A good, solid story that is worth reading. 4.0 stars."
The Shining,"Stephen King is the greatest of them all because he really can jerk a tear playing on nerves of philoprogenitive parents like on the strings of a mellifluous lute… He probably tortured more children than all the rest horror authors of America put together. So what happens? About a week later this stupid cunt of a chambermaid, Delores Vickery by name, she gives out with a helluva shriek while she’s makin up the room where those two stayed, and she faints dead away. When she comes to she says she seen the dead woman in the bathroom, layin naked in the tub. ‘Her face was all purple an puffy,’ she says, ‘an she was grinnin at me.’ So Ullman gave her two weeks’ worth of walking papers and told her to get lost. I figure there’s maybe forty-fifty people died in this hotel since my grandfather opened it for business in 1910. Read in the dead of winter while freezing winds weep sorrowfully and wolves are howling outside."
The Shining,"I mean, what is there really to say about a Stephen King book that hasn’t already been said?! I’m sure this isn’t necessary but…The Shining follows the Torrence family. The father, Jack gets a job being the caretaker for a Hotel over the months when it is closed. Danny, the son, can ‘shine’ and slowly things start to spiral out of control. Something dark lurks within the hotel. This is the first Stephen King book I read, and I actually loved it! I admit, I wasn’t overly scared by it like I hoped I would be, but so far I have been unable to find a book that really scared me. It also took me a lot longer to read than normal books. King includes a lot of detail in his writing and I think this slowed my pace down. I wasn’t going to give this book 5 stars, but the Epilogue blew me away and I knew then that it deserved all 5. I honestly did not expect to finish reading the shining with tears in my eyes. After reading such an incredibly dark book, the final chapter was just so beautiful and pure. I had already seen the film many times but the book was so different, it has a lot more detail and substance to it. I have been left feeling really excited to read my next King book! I would recommend The Shining to anyone that loves a Stephen King novel or a good horror!"
The Shining,"King describes my relationship with this book very well: "" His relationship with his father had been like the unfurling of some flower of beautiful potential, which, when wholly opened, turned out to be blighted inside ."" My first Stephen King, and my first proper horror novel will be my last. I certainly didn't expect to be bored, but I was. After 338 pages / two thirds of the book, I decided life's too short to waste on a book I'm not enjoying. If you want sinister snow, I suggest Kafka's (see my review ) instead. EDIT: Years later, a friend reminded that when reading this, I'd sent this message: Bad news: My car has broken down. Good news: I always have a book with me. Bad news: The first sentence I turned to is about worries of being ""stranded by the side of the road""! Worse news: It's my first Stephen King. The basic plot (family alone and cut-off in spooky house) may not be original, but it started off quite intriguingly, with more literal demons of alcohol, cycles of abusive parenting (one physical, one emotional), and a lonely only-child trying to understand the perplexities adult world. The fact the child, five-year old Danny, can read minds and has hallucinations and premonitions makes the gap between what he sees/knows and understands all the greater. The love a child can feel for an abuser is a strong theme early on: """", and he's terrified of alienating Danny. Similarly, Wendy's troubled relationship with her jealous mother is echoed in the way she envies Danny's closeness to his father. Jack, is a recovering alcoholic, still struggling to stay on the wagon (I assume he gives in later in the book), and although he's never had any paranormal experiences before, he seems to experience some here. Or maybe it's clinical. What's the difference between paranormal (Danny) and ""real"" but distorted perception (Jack)? There were also nods to Alice in Wonderland (indirect) and Bluebeard (explicitly). All these ideas could be fascinating and disturbing, but they didn't really go anywhere, especially after things started jumping out at the family. Once the family were alone in the Overlook Hotel, it became increasingly and infuriatingly formulaic: the build up to something scary, then the relief of everyone pulling through with only minor damage, then the next something scary - perhaps a variant on a previous one, or maybe something new - each one just slightly worse than the previous, interspersed with the odd false alarm. The scary things included all the obvious ones and... actually I can't think of any non-obvious ones, but maybe they come in the final third of the book. All this was interspersed by lazy exposition of what should have been interesting backstory: the dirty dealings in the hotel (organised crime, prostitutes, murder) were revealed by a convenient scrap book, and Jack and Wendy's inner struggles with their own parents and with each other are explained like an introductory psychology primer: Jack wondered if the reason he did X was because Y. SHOW, don't tell! There were plenty of weak clichés ("""", a child feeling like a puppet in adult games, Danny being the key to everything - just like the key in a clock) and several weird typos and missing words. On the other hand, I really laughed at this description of a lift/elevator, that """"! Danny keeps seeing and hearing this, and he knows it's bad and scary. But it's a Mystery. With a capital M. The revelation of what and why it meant was the final straw for me: such an anti-climax, and it doesn't even make sense in the way it's described. One of the things I enjoy about GR is the way it has broadened my reading (and deepened it, too). There are many wonderful books I've read purely because friends with similar tastes have raved about them ( in particular). I gradually noticed quite a few friends whose literary tastes overlap with mine rate King quite highly as a writer. I began to question my avoidance of horror and King, and canvassed advice as to which to read. I wanted to enjoy this - to find a new writer and genre to enjoy, and to prove I should have read King sooner. Perhaps that's why I stuck with it as long as I did (that, and residual guilt from childhood indoctrination never to give up on a book). Even Jack, who wanted to write a book about the hotel, skimmed the scrapbook, so that mitigates my guilt a little. I'm still grateful for the advice about reading King. The fact I've confirmed that King isn't for me is useful knowledge, which is an improvement on uninformed prejudice. * ""The bar, where dark shadows sat sampling the tasty waters of oblivion."" * ""That commonplace sense of history that anyone can feel glancing through the fresh news of ten or twenty years ago."" * ""She recoiled from his hot eyes and tried on a smile that was a size too small."" * ""Staring at the door with a kind of drugged avidity."""
The Shining,"The Shining is a ghost story told the way it should be. The characters are strong and endaring, all in their own right. I actually really like Jack Torrance. He has personality, plenty of flaws, and he’s just like every John Doe next door. Stephen King does an excellent job describing Jack’s descent into madness. Danny is another great character. He’s timid and shy and a small kid, but at the same time he’s the most powerful of all characters, with a gift that might be their only chance to escape. And then of course, the most interesting character of all. The Overlook. Because the way Stephen King describes the hotel, it’s not just a hotel. It’s a person, a living and breathing thing with as sole desire to make sure the Torrances never leave. Suspenseful from the get-go, thrilling and terrifying, this is a great novel. I want to see the movie now, but hope that won’t be a dissapointment. This is my first full-length novel read by Stephen King, and I can’t wait to dive into another one of his works soon."
The Shining,"Wow. This book was such an incredible mindfuck, and now I'm struggling to steer back to reality. This was juicy, staggeringly disturbing, and not only did this book have me on the edge of my seat, for the majority of this read, I was OFF the goddamn seat. This was my third Stephen King novel, and out of the three, it's by far the best. I wasn't expecting to be hooked to this as much as I was. I was extremely tempted to book time off from work, in order for me to finish it. From the outset, it was creepy and dark as hell, and certain passages, scared the living daylights out of me. The writing, in this book, seemed to have no limits, and it's obvious that King, is masterful with his words. It's funny, because as I mostly got my teeth into this book at home, at night, I found myself having a glance behind me, just to check nobody was there. It creeped me out. That is exactly what King sets out to do here. He wants to get into your mind, and the novel then affects you physiologically. It takes talent to do that. I don't think ""IT"" scared me as much. I loved this, and it has got to me maybe more than it should have. I don't think I'll be sleeping well for a while."
The Shining,"4.5 Stars ⛰️⛰️⛰️⛰️1/2 A creepy, dark and atmospheric tale which blurs the lines between mental health and the paranormal The Torrance family relocate to the snowy Colorado mountains, after Jack Torrance gets a job as the winter caretaker at the Overlook hotel. It's a fresh start for the family after some hard times, and a chance for struggling alcoholic, Jack to finally finish writing his play. But as they get snowed in, tensions rise, and the hotel seems to take on a life of its own. Jack's son Danny, has psychic abilities, being able to shine, and when he starts having visions, things go from bad, to much, much worse! So I loved the film adaptation of when I was a teenager, but my friends and I didn't find it scary, more funny! I remember us running around screaming REDRUM after a few too many ciders... I had heard that King didn't like the Stanley Kubrick's film, and now after reading the book, I can understand why! Not only was the film a bit silly, I've also heard that it hasn't aged well. It is just so different, and Kubrick definitely took liberties with the script! Basic things like the character's looks and age are vastly different, their personalities, and their emotions. When I first started listening, I could only visualise Jack Nicholson, but after a while, I realised that Jack in the book was so vastly different from how Nicholson portrayed him. Whilst Jack in the film was a bit unhinged from the start, in that cartoonish way that Nicholson portrayed all his characters, Jack in the book had huge issues with alcoholism and anger management, as well as a terrible childhood. He had so many inner demons, and the isolation of the hotel, the cabin fever, plus family tensions drove him slowly into madness. Wendy was also portrayed differently, we laughed at her in the film, where she was so weak, but in the book, she's much stronger, and just wants her family to be ok. In addition, the film showcased Jack as the star, whereas the book showcased Jack too, but also Danny, Wendy and Dick Hallorann. I was surprised to find that the ending was vastly different, and that certain iconic moments from the film didn't occur at all in the book. definitely felt like a family drama, as well as a horror to me. The focus on both Jack and Wendy's childhoods showed how much they can affect you when you start your own family. Particularly Jack's relationship with his father, and Wendy's relationship with her mother. At times I hated Jack, but I also pitied him, as he was as much as a victim as Wendy and Danny. Other times he made me laugh, as we would hear him say one thing, and then hear his inner dialogue say something else entirely! I really thought that was clever, where we had dialogue, but also got inside the character's heads to see what they really thought, felt, and believed. I can't write a review without mentioning the Overlook hotel... It was a character itself really, so menacing, gradually becoming more violent as the book progressed! It really was a sinister place, and I constantly felt like danger was luring somewhere! The tension from being confined in such an isolated place built marvellously, putting me on edge, and as a reader you wonder, what things mentioned were ghosts, and what were hallucinations?! The descriptions were fantastic, I could really visualise the hotel and the grounds, all of the rooms, and all of the dark things which happened there. Gradually, built up the story, then in the last part, it became so fast paced and gripping, that it took my breathe away! I felt so fearful for Danny and Wendy! It was so unsettling! Campbell Scott did a decent job narrating this! His voice did take me a while to get used to, and I do prefer to have more than one narrator, or a full cast, but I liked him! One of the only negative things I have to say is about Danny's age, he seemed older than five to me?! Oh and the language is quite profane, with the 'N' word being used a lot. I am so glad that I finally read ! It is a classic, and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it, or like me, had only seen the film adaptation. I have already started , and it's very dark, but I'm enjoying it ha ha! —----------—---------------------------------------------------------------- I've gone for as my next audible because I was obsessed with the film when I was a teenager! I can't find the cover I'm listening to though with red writing and Danny stood in that corridor with the light behind him!"
The Shining,To be honest I'm surprised this book scored as high as 3 stars with me. I read this one in two days flat. I wanted to get rid of it as quickly as I could manage. But there's no denying it that King was phenomenal with words here. Phenomenal is the right word. He is a fantastic wordsmith. I just thought that The Shining had a tacky premise.
The Shining,"Back in the day when I read this, years ago, I thought it was pretty good but not fantastic. I went ahead and went through all of SK's movies, too, and remembered watching Jack Nicholson in his iconic crazy and thought to myself, ""Hey! This guy is freaking crazy! I love it!"" And now. I saw the Ready Player One movie with so many scenes right from that old film and had to rewatch the original Kubrick film and read the original novel again for *very* good measure since I'm back on an SK kick. I watched that movie a few days ago and thought to myself, ""This is a really bad movie. I still think that Jack is pretty awesome, but no matter how cool he is, it can't save this film."" And then I read the original book, keeping in mind what SK's thoughts were on the Kubrick film, as remembered so iconically through RPO. He despised it. And as I read The Shining, trying to keep an open mind, I realized something. The Shining is Really, Really Good. Gorgeous details, imagery that blows me away, thoroughly amazing characterization, depth, beauty, and such a great rising unease. I loved Jack in the book. I loved Danny in the book. I loved Halloran in the book. Wendy had a moment or two. But what I loved the most was the Hotel and all its creepy secrets, its depth, its horror. You might say the worldbuilding in this was something pretty damn amazing. And then it hit me. The Kubrick film is a dumpster fire trapped in a bubbling lake of poo. It CRAPPED ON EVERYTHING that made the book great!!!!! Jack in the book went nuts, sure, but the underlying message that ""normal"" novelists writing ""normal"" books are inherently batshit insane in comparison to ""horror"" novelists is as clear as day! Seriously, there's enough story in this book to choke an ox and put any mainstream novel to shame. Because let's face it, SK shows more talent for mainstream fiction in this book than the majority of mainstream fiction, and he's just going to burn the whole house down! :) MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Just do me a favor, folks, and skip any screened production of this novel and stick with the text. You will NOT be disappointed. :) :)"
The Shining,"""The world's a hard place. It don't care. It don't hate you and me but it don't love us, either."" My relationship with horror stories is a weird one. I hate them, but my fascination for them always overpowers that feeling. It may take me ages to pick up a certain book or watch a certain movie but at some point curiosity always kills the cat (and satisfaction brings it back.) The only Stephen King I've read before is . I didn't find it either really frightening or exciting, but it was good. And I just knew that would be on a whole new level. So it was. The foreshadowing was the worst. It held me tight in its grip and nearly crushed me. On the other hand, it made the story predictable. Apart from that, I'm fascinated by how amazingly well constructed the characters are. Same thing applies to background details like the hotel's history, its former owners and guests. King also leaves many questions about the hotel unanswered, which is equal parts torture and genius. That's something I really love about authors: when they don't spill all the secrets, so you'll never totally let go of the book."
The Shining,"Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend. Mix a heaping helping of exposition, a generous spoonful of backstory, a man struggling with alcoholism and a pinch of scares. Shake and pour over ice. Voila! La cocktail de ."
The Shining,One of my favourite books of all time. Genuinely one of the scariest books ever. I was absolutely terrified when I first read it. I found it super intriguing.
The Shining,"This inhuman place makes human monsters. When Jack, an alcoholic 14-months sober, gets offered a job as a caretaker for an old hotel in remote Colorado, he has no choice but to take it. He doesn't have many options - he's been fired from teaching and his play he's been working on is far from finished. He packs up his wife, Wendy, and his psychic five-year-old son, Danny, and waits for the snows to come. The hotel has a Grudge, unfortunately. And Danny's psychic ability is only feeding the Grudge and making it stronger. As the Grudge tries to work it's way into Jack's mind, the possibilities of any of them escaping alive dips toward zero. ... GRUDGE A Grudge is an evil, murderous presence which is tied to a location. If something terrible happens in a place - someone killing their own family and then committing suicide seems to be the most common trigger - then a Grudge is on the place. This book's Grudge apparently is a conglomerate built up over the near hundred years the hotel has been in existence. It consists of the remains of a Mafia killing, and a caretaker who killed his wife and two daughters and then himself, and a woman who commits suicide after her younger lover leaves her. There's probably a lot more. This Grudge sees Jack, his wife, and most especially his little boy Danny as a kind of all-you-can-eat buffet, personally delivered for its enjoyment. If it can kill Danny, therefore tying him to the hotel, it will become very powerful. TRUE HORROR Well, I don't believe in ghosts. But I sure as heck believe in alcoholic abusive men with tempers. And that is the true horror here. Yes, there is an evil presence in the hotel. Yes, it spurs Jack on to murderous intentions. However, that is not the real problem here. The real problem here is that Jack is a bad person. Yes, he loves his wife. Yes, he loves his child. But he has a terrible temper. I can't even blame the alcohol, although that certainly exacerbates things. But Jack does horrifying things while he's stone-cold sober. And way before he's introduced to the hotel's Grudge. Some examples: - Deliberately screws with the mind of a student he despises. Then denies doing it. - Beats aforementioned student unconscious in a parking lot. - Sympathizes with a man who rapes and murders children. - Has such an uncontrollable urge to beat his wife and child that he has to physically leave the house and drive around the neighborhood so he won't lay hands on them. - He has an extremely external locus of control - nothing is his fault. Everything can be blamed on others. This is very dangerous, especially in a man with temper. He takes absolutely no responsibility for his actions or his position in life. Instead he hates everyone else for ""putting him there."" All this is sober, and pre-hotel. So don't try to tell me it's the drink! Don't try to tell me that it's the ghosts! Bullshit. This man is already someone you should be crossing the street to avoid. It's very tempting and easy to blame all your problems on your alcoholism. I've seen it a thousand times. Because alcoholism is a serious and damaging disease. It is. And if it weren't for the drink, life would be perfect - you would be perfect. Right? WRONG. And Stephen King does a subtle job of showing that here. Jack Torrance's problem - his real problem - is that he has a bad temper. There is no cure for that. Going sober is not a cure for that (although it will probably help). Being married to and bearing a child with a man like this is the true horror, I think, and not all this bullshit with dead people in the bathtub. I don't think that comes through clearly to a lot of people, who still think this is a novel about ghosts. CHRISTIAN Of course, Stephen King is one of the leading Christian authors of our time. Stephen King's absolute belief in God, Satan, angels and demons shines from every page of his horror novels. And this is no exception. Young Danny has 'the shining,' and so does the kindly, black, 62-year-old cook for the hotel. This is described as ""psychic"" in the book, but it's obvious (especially near the climax) that they are God-touched and warriors in God's fight with Satan. Hmmmm, a kind of human angel or angel-on-earth if you will. People laugh and also scoff when I baldly state King's rightful place as leading Christian author nowadays, but it's completely true. Actually, one of my atheist friends refuses to read King's books for just this reason. ""King's books are extremely boring,"" he says. ""It's always the same. Deep, deep evil from hell crops up and God must send someone (usually a little boy, although sometimes that changes) to act as His representative and stop Satan from gaining a foothold."" This neatly sums up 98% of King's horror plots. ABUSIVE PARENTS It's doubly hard for Jack and Wendy to parent because both of them come from abusive homes. Jack's father frequently beat his wife and children, putting them in the hospital. Wendy's mother is verbally and emotionally abusive, ripping Wendy and her accomplishments to shreds at every opportunity. We can see how hard each of these people have to fight against continuing the cycle of abuse and attempt to be good parents to Danny. Wendy largely succeeds... Jack not so much. WENDY I liked this character. Wendy is really put through the wringer, and she performs admirably. I loved her bravery and her struggle to protect Danny. She's terrified, weak, and unskilled - but she doesn't let this stop her from doing what she has to do. Well done. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE - Giant hedge animals coming to life and trying to kill people is laughable. Even a master-author like King cannot convince me that this is scary. It's just dumb. - I really did not like the final showdown between little Danny and his father. It rang false. I couldn't believe he was So, that was very disappointing. Tl;dr - A great book, full of nuance and delicate shading. The writing is excellent, the plot as a whole is fascinating. Besides the disappointing, dumb aspect of the climax which I discussed in the above paragraph, this is an overall success. I'm reading all of King's books in order, and of the three I've read, I would rank them: 1.) Carrie 2.) 'Salem's Lot 3.) The Shining This has been the weakest of the three. But still spectacular. I would highly recommend it."
The Shining,"Recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance takes a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, bringing his family with him. But can even his son Danny's special gift, The Shining, stop him from going mad and butchering his family like other caretakers before him? Yes, I'm several decades late to the party in reading this but after reading , I had to read my first non-Dark Tower Stephen King book in years to see how the old man did horror back in the day. I'm not sure this was such a good idea. This book isn't very long but felt like it took a few ice ages for anything to happen. Sure, there were some creepy parts, most of them involving Jack or Danny and the Overlook's ghosts. I think if I hadn't seen the movie first, the book would have been much more enjoyable for me. I think the advantage the movie has over the book is that a third of the time isn't spent delving into Jack Torrance's past. In the movie, we know he's balanced precariously on the razor's edge of madness the first instant we see him and no one in their right mind would want to spend any length of time locked up with him. In the book, we witness the downhill slide for hundreds of pages. The biggest advantage the book has over the movie: the mom is hot and not played by Shelley Duvall. That's all I have to say about that."
The Shining,"The first time I read The Shining was in High School, it was the second Stephen King novel I read. I loved it, I loved the creepy horror aspects of the book and I liked the book much more than I liked the movie. As I continued my Stephen King binge I decided to go back and reread this classic. As an adult I still loved this book but for a different reason. This go around it was the non supernatural aspects that appealed to me most. Jack Torrance our villain was already barely hanging on to his sobriety and sanity before this book even began. The Overlook Hotel didn't make him crazy, it just gave him the final push. Jack would have snapped anyway. Jack was an unemployed recovering alcoholic with a nasty temper. The Overlook just brought out the monster hidden inside him. Stephen King is at his best when he uses real life horror with supernatural horror. Chances are you will never see a ghost or spend a night in a Hotel like The Overlook but people like Jack Torrance really exist. In the news right now is a story about a man who murdered his pregnant wife and 2 small children. I highly doubt a supernatural force made him do it. The Shining is an All- Time classic and it deserves all the hype it gets. If you've never read a King novel The Shining is a good place to start.

The Shining,Could've been about 100 pages shorter. The middle section was kind of boring. But the last 20%....WOW. Totally had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to watch the film version even if it's totally different. I'm sure it'll be hair-raising. 3.5 stars
The Shining,Million stars. I’m overwhelmed. Review to come.
The Shining,"On my journey to reading/re-reading all of SK's books in publication order, this was a re-read but The Shining is always a joy to re-visit not one of my all time favourites but still incredible. A stunning piece of writing and please don’t go off the film for this one it does it no justice (and I quite like the film) It’s hard to believe this is just a story whilst reading as no matter how far-fetched it seems it appears so real and really makes you think it might have happened. It is such a scary story and its popularity isn’t undeserved. I first read this book as a young teen and re-read in my 20’s and I loved it just as much the second and third time this book just doesn’t get old and is still very relevant in today’s society maybe even more so. ""Wendy? Darling? Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just going to bash your brains in."" ""Small children are great accepters. They don’t understand shame, or the need to hide things."" ""If you're going into a very dark place, then you should take a bright light, and shine it on everything. If you don't want to see, why in God's name would you dare the dark at all?"" This is the book that truly made me fall in love with King’s writing and he really is the KING of Horror. It doesn’t get much better than this book the only reason this isn’t getting a 5 star is probably because I saw the film first so I couldn’t stop seeing the film in my head as I was reading, I also think it drags a little sometimes and I just wanted to get to the climax but it wouldn't be SK without a little over explaining. I can see why do many people hate the film because it doesn't capture any of the character development and misses out half of the best bits about the book. This book is spine chilling and an absolute classic a must read. If you haven’t read this yet seriously WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!"
The Shining,"Delee? Yes Danny... Do you feel bad? No Danny, I just really hated your performance in the movie version of THE SHINING. Really Delee? Yes Danny, I hated it more than anything else in the whooole wiiiiide woooorld. I know this is supposed to be a review of the novel THE SHINING, and not the movie...but I can't review the book on its own. I tried...I really did. I first read THE SHINING just before the movie came out on video- some time in the 80s- because usually if I watch the movie first, it is very rare that I go back and read the book- I remember liking it quite a bit, but over the years the movie and the book seemed to have blended into each other in my head. I had only read the book once...but I have watched the movie zillions of times. (okay maybe not zillions...but a lot). Stanley Kubrick version of THE SHINING is visually stunning- no doubt about it- you can tell that Kubrick was a photographer first and foremost. That is what I love about it, and why I go back and watch it over and over again...but character wise he failed miserably. Danny was horrible- The finger talking , and the voice of Tony made me cringe. Movie Wendy (Shelley Duvall-) was sad, weak and pathetic, and Jack Nicholson- as Jack Torrance made the character crazy right from the get go. I never once believed that Jack ever loved his wife and son. Kubrick also took out much of the supernatural in the movie, making it more of a mental breakdown of Jack's character, than influence from a haunted hotel. So for anyone thinking that because they watched the movie, they know the book. They are dead wrong. I went back and re-read THE SHINING after reading Dr. Sleep- the sequel, and continuation of Danny Torrance's life. I decided it was time to once again re-visit Danny's childhood. There was so much I had forgotten and mixed up having watched the movie so many times. The novel follows Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic and writer. After losing his teaching job, Jack decides to accept a position as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the off season. Coming with him are- Wendy- his wife, and Danny- his five year old son (who has psychic abilities). After a winter storm cuts the family off from the outside world- evil forces from the hotel's past, and Jack's own troubled history- start to drive him slowly insane- leaving Wendy, Danny, and Jack in incredible danger. Stephen King wrote THE SHINING when he was in his late twenties and still in his drinking phase. I think that Jack Torrance was the closest King ever came to writing his own true persona from those years, and I can see why he was so disturbed with Kubrick's interpretation. Gone was the strong beautiful wife, gone was the gifted, smart and lovable son, and gone was the sympathetic main character who tried so hard to redeem himself. Suspenseful, thrilling and terrifying- this was a fabulous read...even the second time around."
The Shining,"It’s not the book; it’s me. This is a fine novel. One of the jewels in Stephen King’s crown; written when he still had confidence in the judgment of an editor. Do you want to see King’s skill in characterization and storytelling? How about chills and thrills? Look no further, it’s all here. What’s also here – and this is why the book dragged for me – was the abuse. Whatever Jack’s reasons for dishing it out (daddy issues, drunk, possessed), it was still hard to process and it made it difficult to warm up to the book. People bring their past into any sort of entertainment endeavor and consequently their experience is colored and enriched (or not) by what they choose to watch/read. Again, I can appreciate King’s craft, but didn’t find this a satisfying or fun experience. Before reading this I’d watched the film a few times, enjoyed it, smirked at Jack Nicholson’s over the top performance and thought that Kurbrick’s vision of a horror movie was overblown but decent. After reading the book, it becomes crystal clear why King hated this particular cinematic treatment of one of his books. First, any questions or plot holes that might have been nagging at me after watching the movie were answered within a hundred pages of reading the book. Second, for the most part, the film was horribly miscast – sure Nicholson’s performance was “fun”, but it seems to come out of a different place and his descent into madness was perfunctory rather than slow and tension building. And don’t get me started on Shelly Duvall, the kid and “Tony”. Third, maybe if the movie was made today and it used current CGI (for the evil shrubbery et. al) it might have been more “complete” and better, but I doubt it. I don’t hate the movie, but the book is a more rewarding treatment to this story by miles. Bottom line, the book is terrific, but I didn’t enjoy reading it. This was a huge buddy read with Anne, Stepheny, Trish, Dan 2.0, Jenn and le Ginger."
The Shining,"3.5 ⭐ Update: Post Movie So, I just watched the film with my fiancé. I swear I only said, “This isn’t what happened in the book”, like maximum 6 times…. Oh, my dear lord, the movie is atrocious! I’m not only referring to the dismal acting of basically everyone except for Nicholson or the shitty hotel that has ruined my mental image of what the Overlook would look like. But the amount of shit that was left out or mishandled so they could cram this idea into a 2-hr movie is mind-boggling. Jack’s alcoholism is non-existent, we get none of the flashbacks about his father, it’s not understood that he has anger issues before the hotel interferes, the hotel’s role in is decaying mental health is barely touched upon, Wendy’s character is reduced to a snivelling subservient mouse, Danny’s powers are not effectively communicated and he voices Tony while pivoting his finger up and down (It’s fucking terrible. The kid’s an awful actor! Sorry, not sorry. It’s all good, he’d be like 40-odd now), Halloran is creepy and his only purpose in the movie is as a sacrificial lamb offering up a vehicle so Danny and Wendy can escape…. I could write a damn essay on why this movie was terrible. If you’re thinking, “Oh, I’ll just watch the movie for this one.” Um, no, read the book people! is pretty much everything I’ve always imagined a Stephen King novel to be, to a T. Whilst it is marketed as Supernatural Horror, I feel like it falls short with regards to its genre definition at least as far as the horror element is concerned. Based off this novel (my sole King experience) I imagine that his amazing success is much more to do with fantastic characterisation and nuanced handling of heavy topics (in this case alcoholism, mental health and domestic violence) than anything to do with a knack for spine-tingling scares. Jack is an aspiring writer. He also has issues with anger-management which are only exacerbated by his strong inclination towards the bottle. After making a series of awful life decisions culminating in the loss of his job, Jack is offered a lifeline by an old friend. Jack, along with his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, head to the ‘Overlook Hotel’ where Jack is to be the full-time caretaker during the off-season, however, it seems that perhaps The Overlook is not satisfied with a simple caretaker and has taken a liking to Jack’s son Danny and his mysterious shine. Let’s flip it and get the couple of out of the way first. It’s been a hell of a long time since I read anything from R.L.Stine but I’ll be damned if this didn’t feel, at times, like I was reading a Goosebumps or Fear Street book. I guess what I’m trying to say is that this felt very much like . I grew up with that shit, so mad love, but it really doesn’t have the same effect on a moderately desensitised old 30-something as it would on a pre/early teen. Unless you have an , I doubt you’ll fear anything within these pages. Though, you may be grossed out once or twice. I have a minor gripe with the writing which was otherwise one of the major strengths of the book. On occasion it feels like King’s voice cuts through the characters. This might seem obvious as an author���s characters are him/her to some degree but when that voice comes through a lot of the characters in the same way, it seems odd. One such example is the use of “Baby!” in speech. Eg. “Burn, baby, burn.” “Cash, baby, cash.” “Human Nature Baby, grab it and growl.” I’m hearing King rather than the character and as a result am just pulled out of the story momentarily. The , as mentioned earlier, are King’s characterisation and handling of heavy topics in a nuanced and accurate manner. as early as the quirky character, Watson, but it truly shines in a deeper way with his analysis of Jack. Jack is an alcoholic that really struggles to control his anger. His insatiable thirst for alcohol is truly palpable and his confused, often maniacal, inner monologue show two very different Jacks fighting for control over the same mind. He is often full of bitter anger and self-awareness simultaneously and it seems to tear him apart, particularly when we learn of his childhood and his own father having the same traits. Danny, on the other hand, is a very believable child. He is highly intelligent, emotionally, for his age which I would say is due to The Shining he possesses which is a kind of Psychokinesis. A mashup of Telepathy, premonitions and a spiritual connection to the dead. At the same time, however, he is so evidently just a little kid stuck in this absolutely horrifying scenario, witnessing his own father losing his mind and trying his best to support his mother whilst not falling apart himself. I have a number of other King titles on my shelves and look forward to visiting some of them at a later stage. Though I didn’t love this one, I’m well aware that King’s back catalogue is long and stretches to a number of different genres. Happy reading!"
The Shining,"I had never planned to read one of Stephen King's best books for last. I started fairly young with Cujo, and then went forward instead of back. The movies for many of his books by then, including The Shining were already out there, and of course I had seen them. During that period, I hadn't known King's feelings on Kubrick's movie, the portrayal of Jack with many etceteras. I just figured the movie told the story, and so that was it. So I read his others, and time goes by. King wrote an intro for readers later on that I found in a beat up paperback copy I own. The cover art sucks because it shows a young boy with a face that looks decidedly mad and possibly evil. I knew enough about Danny to know that the picture wasn't true, but I kept the book around for the intro. In it, King says, “there comes a time in a writer's career when you got to make a choice: either do what you've done before, or try to reach a little higher.” Before I read The Shining, I would have thought he'd done just that with Salems' Lot. But I understand the certain differences he hints towards. Jack becomes more realistic to readers because of his own backstory, the abusive relationship with his own father. Instead of letting readers make the leap, he delves into it for a time. The depth of a plot always matters, or alters our experience. It's not simply The Overlook pressing its will on Jack, but also something deep inside of him. King and Kubrick actually discussed this topic. Kubrick went another way, and that's fine. But also it's not fine because while a movie can be 2 dimensional and still be entertaining, a good book can't be, not really, not if it's to be better than the last, and remembered for so long."
The Shining,"I rarely read horrors so when I read one I want it to blow me away and remind me why I am scared of them. And this one did scare me bad at times but the finale was not what the story was building upto in my opinion. I wanted it to be more scary. Except that I loved the book, the slow build up, the tension, the little details, all was fantastic."
The Shining,how is this book so popular?! it is boring as FUCK
The Shining,"4.5 stars First of all I’d like to congratulate myself for making it to this day without being spoiled! I hate spoilers so much and I go to extreme lengths to avoid them (like skipping that friends episode where Joey and Rachel were spoiling books) I’m just glad I finally get to read this book so I could live my life normally without having to avoid being spoiled. There’s nothing I could say that hasn’t already been said about this book. I just enjoyed it a lot! What a ride it was! It freakin stressed and creeped me out. The setting was so scary, spooky, and atmospherically creepy. We got a haunted hotel. A complete isolation in that creepy hotel with no means of contact and no way out. The madness and hallucinations the hotel started to cause. The idea of the book is just completely scary. Also, the characters were so well written. I loved how we slowly get to know more about them and their inner conflicts and their relationship as a family. The book was just so enjoyable to read!"
The Shining,"As the snow piles up ever higher, madness is making its way through the myriad hallways of the Overlook Hotel. It seeps into the fragile mind of the off-season caretaker, a recovering alcoholic who is ensconced in the hotel with his wife and young son. Things creep here at the Overlook, from the hedge animals in the elaborate topiary, to the pressure valve of the ancient boiler, to the hose of an old-fashioned fire extinguisher. Vestiges of atrocities committed through the years within the confines of the establishment continue to menace."
The Shining,"Some movies are so memorable that the mere mention of them evokes vivid images. ""E.T"" for instance. Say the name and my mind immediately conjures that adorable alien on his bicycle with a young Drew Barrymore, a bright moon rising behind them. Another is ""The Exorcist"". Who doesn't see Linda Blair's head swiveling around too far, crunching as it does, a malevolent smile on her bloody face. Or puke spewing out her mouth. Then of course, say the words ""The Shining"" and most of us picture Jack Nicholson and his lurid grin, head bulging through the crack in the door: "" Johnny!"" Shudder, shudder, !!! For the longest time, I didn't want to read because I was certain I would just see that creepy face of Jack Nicholson the entire time. However, my GR friend Carly read the book a year ago and said the book is different enough that she rarely ""saw"" Jack Nicholson so I decided to add it to my TBR list. She was right. I did not see Jacky boy in the book, only once or twice did I think of him. Instead, I saw an entirely different movie playing out in my mind as I read, with entirely different characters. That is not to say the book differs that much from the movie, though I watched it so long ago that I had forgotten much of it. Dang ! What is it with Stephen King that his novels are so ? I cannot pinpoint why but I think it's safe to say he is a literary genius. I absolutely loved this book, even more than the movie though I didn't find it scary for the same reason most people do. As with the movie, I was afraid of Jack Torrance because of Jack and his own inner demons, the ghosts of the abuse he suffered as a child that lead him to drink and become a monster. I suppose because I don't believe in anything supernatural I was not scared by the house but instead saw it as a metaphor. It is Jack himself I feared, not the house, not some spirit or spirits that make him become evil, that control him and cause him to try to kill his wife and child. It's never the supernatural that scares me but other human beings in their capacity for evil due to untreated mental illness and/or addiction. And that is how I saw the book, as a metaphor to Jack's addiction. The ""ghosts"" were in his own mind driving him to drink and changing him into a different person than sober Jack. And is Jack-under-the-influence a freaking scary person!!!! Holy crap! I don't know how many times I found myself holding my breath, terrified for Danny and Wendy. I did not want this book to end; though it was 660 pages, it could have been three times as long and still wouldn't have been long enough. Thankfully, since it's not a never-ending book, there are many other Stephen King books that I have yet to read. My one complaint is the use of the 'N' word. I think it should have been left out and hopefully if King wrote the book today, he would. On one hand, it's paired with evil behaviour so at least there is that. But did he really need to use it as much as he did, particularly towards the end? Wouldn't once have sufficed? That bitch aside, I highly recommend this book if you haven't yet read it or haven't read any King and want to understand what all the hype about his books is about. It'll take you on one hell of a ride! (I'm not entirely sure what qualifies a book as a classic, but since this book is almost my age and still widely read, I will grant it classic status and have it be my January 2020 classic-of-the-month)"
The Shining,"This is my third Stephen King novel and was a buddy-read with some ""veterans"". In this classic horror novel, we follow 5-year-old Danny and his parents. His father used to be an alcoholic, who eventually lost his job due to a (sober) outburst that ended in violence towards one of his students. As a last chance, a friend from the school's board gives him the job of caretaker for an old hotel up in the mountains throughout the winter (the hotel is closed then and cut off from the world but still needs some rudimentary works to be carried out). After some further people are introduced, we get glimpses into the lives of all three characters and learn a lot about their family lives, marriage and Danny's childhood. Simultaneously, we learn of the hotel's history that could explain the growing sense of unease and darkness as the story unfolds. When the snow has set in in earnest and there is no getting off the mountain, the monster(s) come out to play. I know, it sounds mundane, boring even, but that is because my description has to stay vague so as not to give away too much. We've had ""gifted people"" before in King's books. And we've had vampires, undead creatures as well as evil clowns (not really but any other noun would give the plot of that one away). Here, the ""creature"" and therefore additional cast member is a building. It's amazing how the author managed to flesh it out and give it character as if it was just another human being however. It felt alive throughout the book, like a person slowly waking up from a slumber and then raging. Brilliant! As usual for Stephen King, the supernatural element is well done but the true monsters are the people in here. Actually, this is the first novel I've read of SK's where there is at least one truly good person. Usually, we start liking someone but then get a glimpse into their thoughts or pasts and find out that no matter how pretty the facade, there usually is at least a little bit of rot at the core. Not in this case. That is not to say that there aren't monsters here. Basically, this is a story of domestic violence and abuse, but with a supernatural twist and King's usual depth to the single characters (even the not really important ones). Even the mother, who could be described as a victim, was not without severe fault and I caught myself wanting to smack her more than once. I like how many of the author's characters struggle so wonderfully - in the end, they often lose due to small things that get blown out of proportion. Just like nothings can turn into a huge fight between spouses. The Overlook Hotel can't get you if there isn't at least the smallest bad seed already inside of you and it works great to emphasize what human beings can do to one another and how madness as well as darkness can be and often are hereditary. The angle on addiction was also extremely well done and realistic, showcasing King's experience and research, and made the sense of dread and unease even stronger (maybe because I've experienced drunks and have had a problem with people consuming a certain amount of alcohol ever since). Oh, and yes, I've seen the movie. No, it's nothing like the book and actually a disgrace so I understand King's hatred of it. And nobody give me any excuses like ""but it's an old movie"" because the other SK movie adaptations I've seen are old as well and all better than Kubrick's movie. Anyway, this audiobook was very well done. The narrator had a nice way of slightly changing the voice of Jack over time to mark his slow but sure deterioration and he managed to make me jump quite a few times. So yeah, this might be one of my favourites though it is hard to tell with Stephen King. The interesting thing about that is that I didn't feel as deeply for or about the characters as I did when reading his other novels (I loved the kids, though not their adult selves, in and loved to hate everyone in ) and yet ... Call me a fangirl but the man has a way of picking mundane ideas and twisting them fantastically, before shoving a host of everyday characters into the arena and watch them fight it out. *lol* Every book is a wonderful and thorough character study and I'm loving it."
The Shining,"Full review now up! The Shining is my first book by Stephen King and first horror novel as well. I could think of no better author than The Master of Horror himself for my introduction into this genre. Of course, I have seen the movie version of years ago. Only vague details remained clogged in my memory from that experience, but not much else. So, I went into this with as little knowledge as possible for such a popular book. I believe this helped me enjoy the story more and let the buildup to the more frightening scenes have better effect. Not that I was ever truly frightened……honest, but I was severely creeped out a few times. Stephen King just has that knack for setting up a scene to get the most shock value out of it. There was a few times I was like, yeah, that’s not that scary. But by the end of the scene I’m on the edge of my seat screaming run, run, damn you. I believe what makes this story so relatable are the characters and some of the events that take place. They could be from any normally dysfunctional family, and many of us have experienced some kind of paranormal activity. Of course, not to the extreme point that is in this book, but even a small paranormal experience can be disturbing. Bye the way, the next time I see animal shrubs, I will be turning around and going the opposite direction. Or I’m going in with a Ghostbusters proton pack strapped on my back. That’s the only way. Going into this book I had always wondered why the book was named . I don’t remember the movie ever explaining this, but like I said, it has been years since I watched it. Needless to say that question was put to bed early and was a main focal point in the story. Why only 4 stars? Well, for my first horror novel I didn’t really have anything else to compare this to. I really enjoyed the book, but I wasn’t really satisfied with the ending. Everything was wrapped well enough, but I just had a few issues. I won’t go into detail for fear of spoilers, but that is why this didn’t get the full 5 stars. I’m glad I picked to get me started in this genre. Although, I won’t take all the credit. My good GR buddy Craig had a role to play in that as well. So, hats off to you mate for the excellent recommendation. I would most definitely recommend this to readers out there who have not delved into this genre before. And those of you that have…why have you not read this yet? I will be adding the horror genre to my favorites list, so you will be seeing more horror reviews from me in the future. Until then...happy reading! 4 stars ****"
The Shining,Finally read this horror classic! I've seeing this movie so many times that it was fascinating to spot the differences both big and small. I'm going to watch the movie with fresh eyes tonight and will post a book/movie comparison next week.
The Shining,"“Sometimes human places, create inhuman monsters.” I couldn't possibly tell you how I, as a horror lover since childhood, have managed to live to the age of 31 years old without being seeing The Shining or being spoiled for more than the barest bones of this story's plot, but I'm pretty sure it was thanks to some sort of universal intervention on my behalf because the cosmos knew I would adore this, or something. 😅 Seriously though, I absolutely loved this book! It's easily my new favorite Stephen King title, which is saying a lot, because it's been years since I read and nothing beat that out until this novel. I was fully hooked from the first chapter and couldn't get enough of the claustrophobic setting, the lovable characters of Danny and Hallorann, and most of all, the immense feeling of that built in me with every turning event. I won't spoil anything in case you're somehow like me and haven't experienced this one yet, but I will say that I didn't expect the ending we got, and I was really pleased with it. From start to finish, this was a gorgeously told story that I'm going to think about for a long time to come. (And yes, I'll watch the movie next, but I don't have high hopes. After all, the book is always better, right?) ✨ one Black side character ✨ for: ——— | | |"
The Shining,"I don’t read much horror, but gave this a try because I have loved true crime lately. I appreciated how the characters were introduced, but this book probably gained an extra star from me for simply being about Colorado. I loved the set up of the empty hotel, where known events could be pictured by characters in the location where they happened. This aspect made the reality of seeing ghosts more real to my skeptical nature, but it wasn’t enough. I tried to scare myself with this book but was unaffected. I would read late at night, all alone, hoping I would have trouble going to sleep, but when I got in bed the only things troubling me were the election and my last muffed stroke on a golf course. The ending gave no surprises and didn’t pull anything back together, as I thought would happen in such a famous book. I would have given it two stars but, like I said, it’s about Colorado."
The Shining,"I forgot for a minute there just how much I love early Stephen King. While the movie is also amazing I am so glad I finally made it to this book which has been more than patiently sitting in my TBR for longer than I would care to admit. I love that there is just enough of a supernatural aspect and the creep factor feels completely real. Danny’s father has a last chance - a job as the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel in Colorado. Danny and his mother are going with Jack, but when they get there they find there is more to this hotel than the building itself. Danny has a gift, the ability to read thoughts or emotions and sometimes to just know things, he meets a cook named Dick who tells him he has the strongest Shine he’s ever seen. But his gift also makes him shine brightly to the things that go bump in the night."
The Shining,"As I read, I had to keep reminding myself who wrote this book in 1977. Indeed, I found some things that Stephen King used in other novels. These facts mean that ""Shining"" is, in a way, one of the precursors of all author's fantasies. Knowing him a little, I knew there were some things to watch out for. For example, when I heard about wasps, I thought they would play an important role. Stephen King's narration of insect bites frightens the reader on this subject. I could hear them buzzing in my ears ...! Other things concerning the fantastic seemed to me to be foreseeable. For example, strange phenomena appear when the author presents his characters; we suspect who will be affected and who will switch to the dark side."
The Shining,"And now he was crouched in a dark hallway, crouched on a blue hallway with a riot of twisting black shapes woven into its pile, listening to the booming noises approach, and now a Shape turned the corner and began to come toward him, lurching, smelling of blood and doom. It had a mallet in one hand and it was swinging it (REDRUM) from side to side in vicious arcs, slamming it into the walls, cutting the silk wallpaper and knocking out ghostly bursts of plasterdust: In Stephen King's iconic novel , Jack Torrance has recently lost his teaching job and is a recovering alcoholic. He has a wife, Wendy, and a five-year-old boy, Danny. We quickly learn there is more to this small family than what's on the surface. Danny is plagued by bizarre visions and goes into trances, claiming to see a vague person named Tony when he's bodily incapacitated. Tony is always far off, out of reach, and his origins and meaning are unclear to Danny. Meanwhile, Jack is revealed to have a somewhat violent past, and the reader learns that he is quick to anger, and can lose his temper quite severely. He constantly thinks about having another drink, about relapsing back into the extreme alcoholism that plagued him for years, ever since college. Jack is determined to stick it out, for the sake of his family, and an old friend of his soon cuts him a break and sets him up with a job in the Colorado Rockies as the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. But the Overlook is not what it appears to be, and neither are Jack or Danny... Overall, I thought was a fantastic book. It's not a full-blown masterpiece, at least in my view, because it does have some flaws, but I do consider it to be somewhat of a masterpiece. I'll explain why it is and it isn't. Let's start with why it isn't. Simply put, parts of it are extremely boring, and they drag out quite noticeably. Long scenes of probably at least ten pages cover monotonous events like Jack re-shingling part of the Overlook's roof, or getting into drunken exploits with fellow alcoholics, or researching the long and tediously-outlined history of the Overlook Hotel. I didn't feel all of these scenes added to the story; some did, but some were repetitive or overly drawn-out. There were also some things that made King seem like a horny and/or creepy adolescent, like the bizarre and repeated references to female breasts and particularly to squeezing and fondling them. That became a little deranged after a while, and I found it somewhat off-putting and immature. At the end of the day, it's a bit hard to say ""That's the best book ever! What a masterpiece!"" when there are issues of tedium and borderline perversity like these present throughout the book. Or at least for me it is. Now to why it is somewhat of a masterpiece. Mainly, for me, this comes down to Jack Torrance. What an amazingly executed character. He's actually a pretty terrible person. As I said, he's quick to anger and can be violent, but he also just generally seems like an a**hole. People will be explaining things to him and he seems very disinterested or he patronizes them in his responses, as if he's this huge narcissist that thinks he already knows everything and is engaged that you'd even have the nerve to think he needs such things explained to him. He speaks in a short manner with people like he wants to knock everyone out cold and like he needs serious anger management training. He's just not a very nice guy. But it's how it all comes together and builds up that is so masterful. The things I mentioned are just little things that, along with his struggle with alcoholism, the pressure to provide for his family, and so many other things, combine to make him extremely and believably susceptible to sinister forces and to going insane, which he of course eventually does. It was just so brilliantly developed and built up; you could actually his growing madness, and it infected every aspect of his personal and professional life. Absolutely brilliant. Jack's son Danny and Overlook chef Dick Hallorann are also exceptional characters, and they played very well together. I loved them both. Wendy I found to be the biggest doormat and fool of a character I've seen in some time in a book; she was absolutely awful, and her naivete was so extreme it became unbelievable by the end of the book. But for the most part, the characters in this book are superb, and I doubt I'll ever forget some of them. , until about the last hundred pages, is the absolute slowest of slow burns, but Jack Torrance's descent into madness is among the greatest I've ever read in literature, and the constant atmosphere of dread created and skillfully wielded by King is a thing to be admired. A full cast of mostly excellent and unforgettable characters rounds out what is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror novels I've had the pleasure of reading (although it's not as scary as ). Highly recommended."
The Shining,"The Shining is the greatest ghost story of the 20th Century. I haven't read every ghost story written in that hundred-year period, and I'm sure there are others that some folk rate as being better, but I can't see how a finer and more scary story of a haunting could have been written than this one. (If you have suggestions I'd love to hear them) This novel is Stephen King at his absolute best. It's the perfect intersection of his mastery of story, his command of the horrific and his flair for tension. You most likely know the story already. Jack Torrance, a flailing, alcoholic writer with a troubled past takes a job as the winter season caretaker at The Overlook Hotel in Colorado, a huge, long-halled and echoing building. He and wife (Wendy) and his son (Danny) move into the hotel, and he settles in to write, hoping that the peace and lack of distraction will help him create something great while the snow piles up outside, cutting them off from the world. Danny, although he is only five years old, is touched with a gift. He's a shiner, someone with an extra-sensory ability. He can perceive things from the past, foresee some events and is aware of things that lurk on the edges of reality, out of the sight of ordinary people. Very soon he begins to sense that The Overlook is a malignant, corrupting place, a place that will seduce his father into homicidal madness. As the Hotel begins to lure Jack into the darkness his wife and son must struggle to survive inside their vast wintery prison. I know, I know. The way I've described it makes it sound hokey, like a twilight zone episode or a jump-scare b-movie plot. Trust me though, like so many things it's the way it's done that matters, not the subject matter, and this story is told superbly. King writes an alcoholic writer like no-one else (he lived that life, and it shows on the page) and he chronicles Jack's corruption and Danny's connection with the evil that has been done in his new home in ways that will genuinely chill you. I challenge you not feel a touch of fear reading this one, particularly after sundown. I definitely felt my own anxiety rise as the shadows outside lengthened. You get double points if you can manage reading it on a cold winter's night. I read this book when I was a teenager and re-read it as an adult, something I almost never do. Both times I was equally as chilled as I was awed. If you've never read King, this is where you should start. If you've only seen Kubrick's film, read this novel. The movie is good, but the book is a masterpiece. This one deserves more than stars - I give it five menacing REDRUMs."
The Shining,I always felt this was far more scary than the 80's movie. The story is claustrophobic and you feel very trapped with this madman. It is such a scary story. It is one of Stephen's better early works. Leaving out all the ghosts and getyous I would enjoy being somewhere for Winter snowed in for one year. I could read and write. Retirement goals. This book does what it intends and it is entertaining. This is the apex of the haunted house genre.
The Shining,"CW/TW: alcoholism, physical violence, casual homophobia, casual racism, mentions of past domestic abuse, strong language ""Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win."" — Aspiring writer badly needs a brand-new start which perfectly came as a job offer as the off-season caretaker of the old and atmospheric situated in the Colorado Rockies. After years of succumbing to his alcoholism and anger issues which caused him to accidentally break the arm of his five-year-old son, , and to ultimately lose his position as a teacher after assaulting a student, Jack sees that the hotel's seclusion would be a great chance to reconnect with his family and to work on a play. However, as the winter sets in and as the cold becomes harsher, the picturesque and grand location starts to become even more remote and sinister. Bizarre things start occurring yet the only one who can notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny, blessed with extraordinary psychic abilities of reading minds, experiencing premonitions, and clairvoyance otherwise known as . Forty-three years after its first publication, Stephen King's iconic novel still manages to stupefy and blind its readers with its brightly deep characterization and masterfully gripping execution of the haunted house trope, cementing itself as a rightful classic of the Gothic horror genre. If there is a significant aspect which illuminates King's novels, with The Shining as one of the best examples, it would be his characters. King's exceptional creation of intricate and round characters is what sets his novels apart from other plot-driven horror stories. The mastery of honing the characters' motivations and the ability to successfully depict them through words elevate from a supposedly typical haunted house story to an eerily disturbing account of psychological horror—blurring the lines of what scares are cognitively and humanly induced and which ones originate from the supernatural. It is also important to add that may arguably one of the most complex child characters ever written, as proven by the profundity of his motivations: Another fascinating part of the novel is the surprising yet well-appreciated humor in the form of hilarious dad jokes which successfully lighten the mood before the impending doom of the midpoint unfolds: Moreover, King's artistic choice of figuratively foreshadowing the novel's plot through the use of the wasp allegory alongside manifesting the building boiler pressure as a reflection of Jack's turbulent temperament are among his ingenious writing decisions. These make the novel's prose more layered and complex as it demands scrutiny from the reader. The greatest feat of the novel, however, is its triumphant avoidance of the adverse portrayal of a battered and beleaguered wife. King challenges this notion by creating , the resilient and steadfast mother willing to do anything to protect her son. This deliberate departure from the incessantly-abused-mother-and-child trope is the root of King's of Kubrick's film adaptation of the novel, saying that Wendy in Kubrick's film is ""one of the most misogynistic characters ever put on film"" and that she is not ""the woman that [King] wrote about."" On another note, King indeed humanizes his characters so much that their errors and prejudices litter the dialogue with casual remarks of homophobia and racism, which is an way to show how wicked humans may be (especially when consumed by unidentifiable forces). It would be more successful if such remarks are blatantly challenged, though these may be given pardon due to the nature of the scenes where such occurred. Stephen King's may be forty-three years old, but the years don't dim the novel's shine as its timeless brilliance proves it rightful to be called one of the most iconic horror classics of all time.

The Shining,"I hadn't really realized just how deeply this story is embedded in the collective unconscious until I mentioned to a friend a few years back that my now husband and I were considering getting married at The Stanley Hotel, the Colorado landmark where the movie version of this book was set. ""Are you insane?"" she said to me. ""You cannot do that. I will spend the entire ceremony waiting for blood to start pouring out the elevators."" We got married down the road instead."
The Shining,"Wow! If you have only seen the movie, you definitely should read the book too as there are quite a few scary differences. I must admit that several times throughout the book the image of Jack Nicholson came to mind though. Stephen King's writing is really amazing! NO slow or boring parts here."
The Shining,"”Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” 3.5 ★ when Jack Torrance gets a new job at the atmospheric and secluded Overlook Hotel he plans to work on his writing and spend time with his wife Wendy and their son Danny. but what the family will soon find out is that the hotel has a lot of history and not all of it is good.. to say the least. throughout their stay things start to unravel in ways none of them would have expected and what this all leads to is extremely detrimental to Jack’s sanity and love he has for his family. i can’t believe i’ve finally read this after meaning to for centuries. i was aware of the story centering around Jack’s slow descent into madness and the paranormal take on that was something i really enjoyed. you could almost argue that Jack would’ve ended up this way whether they stood at the hotel or not because of his prominent anger issues and drinking problems. i felt for Danny in this situation cause he loves his father no matter what and despite him having (telepathic/clairvoyant powers), he doesn’t want to believe the things the spirits are warning him of. the only reason this isn’t a 4 is cause of how slow the beginning was and i didn’t get invested until the 2nd half. the ending was seriously incredible though and i can’t wait to FINALLY see Jack Nicholson’s ✨iconic✨ portrayal! i know Stephen King is not a fan of the interpretation.. so i’m curious to see where i’ll land."
The Shining,"So. Freaking. Great. 2019 REREAD Loved it the second time around as well, definitely picked up on more details too, which was a lot of fun. Easily one of the best atmospheric horror novels out there! So glad the upcoming film gave me the final push to finally revisit this iconic novel, and I'm onto rereading the sequel next!"
The Shining,"MY rating: 4.1/5 They call this book 'The iconic Horror' and Iconic Horror it is. They call this book 'The greatest horror novel of all time' and The greatest horror novel it is. I have watched the movie version which is directed by the greatest director Stanley Kubrick and the movie version is not really similar to the book at all. The movie is more Stanley Kubrick and the book is more Stephen King. ( this is the best explanation I presume) I don't know what to say, really. The book is great and I am still thinking about it. I couldn't find any types of problems with the story or the characters but I loved the characters and story more in the movie version. I like it in the book too but I loved the movie version better. Everyone has to read this one."
The Shining,My first Stephen King book! This honestly exceeded my expectations. The character work was fantastic! I also really enjoyed the pacing of the plot which I never really liked in the film adaption. I’m really excited to read more by King soon!
The Shining,"What can I say about The Shining? It is listed among Stephen King's best novels and it was turned into one of the most iconic movies of the last 40 years. I don't read a lot of horror, but I was interested in this one after learning that the character of Jack was based on King's own struggles with alcoholism. I have an addiction to addiction stories, so I was intrigued. My husband had also wanted to read The Shining, and he found a nice first edition at a used bookstore. (On the page listing other books by Stephen King, only two titles are there: Carrie and 'Salem's Lot.) While he continued browsing, I sat down and started reading. I was instantly caught up in the story of Jack and his family. Jack is trying to redeem himself after a disastrous mistake in his teaching career, and his wife, Wendy, is torn about whether to stay married to him. Their precocious 5-year-old son, Danny, also has problems and both parents are worried about him. Although, ""precocious"" doesn't fully explain Danny's gifts. He has psychic powers, and everything starts to go to hell in a handbasket when he and his parents move to the Overlook, a haunted hotel in the Colorado mountains, so Jack can be its caretaker over the winter. Poor Danny becomes the conduit for the ghosts in the hotel, and the spirits also wreak havoc on Jack and his fragile sobriety. I haven't read a lot of King's books, but the writing in Shining is so strong that I could tell why it's considered one of his best. Here are a few good lines: This book is scary.* There is a famous scene in Room 217 that I read with my hand half-covering my eyes. The descriptions of the hedge animals coming alive, and the times when Danny knows he is being stalked, are terrifying. When Danny calls for help toward the end of the book, I was so engrossed I stayed up really late just so I could finish. Whew! Since I am nearly four decades late in reading this book, most people seeing this review have likely already read it, but if you haven't and if you want a good literary scare, I highly recommend it. ""He would write it for the reason he felt that all great literature, fiction and nonfiction, was written: truth comes out, in the end it always comes out. He would write it because he felt he had to."" I was reading this book when I found out my mother had cancer, and after one night during which she collapsed, I said to my husband, ""I don't know which is scarier: The Shining or what's happening with my mom."" He nodded gravely."
The Shining,"Jack Torrance has been given the chance to turn his life around after being hired to work as a winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. Isolated from the rest of the world for months, Jack plans to rekindle his relationship with his wife Wendy and his son Danny all the while fighting his brutal alcohol addiction and working out his anger issues. Unfortunately for Jack, the Overlook Hotel has other plans for him and his family. The hotel is haunted by evil spirits with violent and tragic histories, taking advantage of Jack's own troubled past and his son Danny's psychic abilities. A peaceful winter getaway might just become a true nightmare. The Shining is a fantastic exploration of the struggles of alcoholism, financial ruin and past tragedies constantly coming back to bite you where it hurts most. It's about the dangerous cycle of addiction, following in the footsteps of your abusers and seeing how it comes back to hurt you and everyone around you. The fashion in which the basic elements of normal, human struggles is depicted in this book is far scarier than any ghost or even the Overlook Hotel itself. The family drama between Jack, Wendy and Danny had me constantly upset and on the edge. Jack is a beat-down, broken and pitiful man down on his luck. He says and does some pretty horrible and disgusting things, but I developed a soft spot for him the more I learned about his troubles and what made him the way he is. He's not a good guy at all, but almost everyone can find something about him that's uncomfortably relatable. He represents the bad parts of ourselves that we don't like to admit exists. Most of the time we can keep him in check, but sometimes he breaks through the cracks in our darkest and most vulnerable moments. It's a slow burner with a lot of heart. As dark and depressing as it is, the overall message behind the story is an uplifting one. We don't have to allow ourselves to be defined by our pasts, our guilt, or the mistakes of the ones who raised us. We can always try our best to go in the opposite direction and set a good example for others. Danny's friendship with Hallorann is also awesome and wholesome. Two psychic boys from totally different generations and upbringings finding a meaningful connection through their mutual struggles. My rating: 5/5"
The Shining,"3.25 stars “Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” As someone who only watched the movie and just recently started Stephen King, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I was so so wrong in the best way possible. Jack Torrance, an ex-drunk, gets a job in the Overlook hotel as a winter caretaker.The Overlook isn't just a hotel though... and his son is no ordinary boy. Trigger warning: . A lot of it in the last fifth or so. It made me uncomfortable reading it. I know it was meant to be showing the ""bad guys"" but I am just not ok with it. The fact that it was a different time when this was published can't really change my opinion because reading it now, I was just too grossed out and uncomfortable. The extremity of this did lower my rating. This is my third experience with . His writing is very nuanced; with a lot of character. It was hard to get into during my first two reads but now I am getting more used to it. That being said, (I am reading in release order). Scenes are more gorey, characters' emotions more felt, and the setting is more atmospheric. I can't wait to see where it goes next. Something that I am noticing in King's works is that he likes to tackle hard subjects in his books. In it was bullying, in it was religion in the face of disaster. In it is alcoholism. In the very beginning we see flashbacks to Jack hurting Danny and later on to Jack's father being an abusive alcoholic. The terrors that the hotel sends on the Torrance family is meant to parallel symptoms of alcoholism. The themes of sons reflecting their fathers was also something that I thought was interesting and I wonder if it will continue with . I really came to care for Jack, Wendy, and Danny. I understood where Jack was coming from and really was happy for him at the beginning when he felt ok. As he started descending into madness and as he started to not be able to keep it at bay, my heart was breaking as much as Danny and Wendy's. If you are looking for a great character-driven story, this is it. I did think that 3/4 of this book was very off when it came to pacing. It was not as bad as in , but it did make it hard to push through to the great moments at times. When the great moments came though, they were amazing. After the build up and the subtle foreshadowing right from the first few pages, the ending managed to tie it all together in a splendid knot. It was one of the best endings I have ever read. I enjoyed greatly. In my opinion it is better than the movie. If you are looking to get into King's work, this may not be the best place to start, but it is a great book overall."
The Shining,"Damn. That was intense. This was my first time reading The Shining and believe it or not I have never watched the film adaptation [yet]. I did however experience Universal Studio's debut of the Overlook Hotel haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights last year and if that was any indication I knew this story was no joke. My in-person book club read Ready Player One last month and we weren't quite ready to leave the experience so we chose as our next read since there were quite a few related scenes. I had been wanting to read it anyway so it was a very appreciated push towards my ""read all the books"" goal which will surely take a lifetime. maintains a mass following for a reason. It's good. The writing, the setting, the massive themes that everyone can relate to. We all have regrets, shame, and our own personal demons that haunt us unsolicited. ...and sometimes they don't. is climbing to the status of a classic for good reason. It was a twisted, suspenseful ride, and I'm so glad I finally read it."
The Shining,"This was a re-read via the audiobook, narrated by Campbell Scott. He is FANTASTIC! I loved every minute of this audio and highly recommend it, even if you've already read the book or seen the movie. *I obtained this audio through my local library. Libraries RULE!*"
The Shining,"2/5 ★'s ⬬ Audiobook - unfortunately ⬬ So, once again I won't be writing a full review at the moment. However, this was extremely disappointing!

The , but nothing to rave about. It took It seems Stephen King just. I can't wait to watch"
The Shining,"One of King’s most famous books I didnt know was so famous up until now as I just recently started to get into his novels. I was eager to read The Shining partly because I did not know what I was getting myself into. Past and actual horrors awaits at the Overlook Hotel menacing Jack, the new caretaker, his wife and gifted (or cursed?) 5 years old son. To me, it wasnt just one of many hunted house story, it was more than that. Its also about a family fighting their own demons as many strange and terrible things happen at the Overlook. The characters Stephen created were amazing and unique. We get just the right amount of suspense, not too much to get lost in it and lose interest. It was perfect."
The Shining,"If you enjoy reading horror, then this book is a must-read! It's a real page-turner! I read it about 40 years ago shortly after it was first published, and it still gives me chills to this day! Warning: once you read this book, DO NOT see the movie of the same title starring Jack Nicholson - it was so disappointing, and at best, a joke."
The Shining,"THE SHINING [1977] By Stephen King My Review 5.0 Out Of 5.0 Stars I finished my second reading of “The Shining [1977]” at midnight last night. I did not read the excerpt from the sequel “Doctor Sleep” since it is my intention to read it in the very near future. First, I was taken aback by the page count since I did not remember this modern American classic of horror tallying 673 pages. Second, I do not have a doggone clue when I read it the first time, only that I thought it was the cat’s meow as Stephen King would say back then. It was initially published in 1977 after all. Finally, it is still the “cat’s meow” in my opinion, after what, 46 years? There is only a scant description of the story you will explore in its nearly 700 pages. Our leading adult male character is one Jack Torrance who cannot look in the rearview mirror with a clear conscience, that is until he has half-a-second to rationalize all of his atrocious behavior away and into the ether. What Jack wants is the proverbial “fresh start” and at least in theory his acceptance of the off-season caretaker’s job of the Overlook Hotel could provide precisely that, if not more (Jack still harbors a smidgeon of hope that his buddy Al can smooth over the sharp edges of the memories of the committee’s recollections of Jack’s horrendous behavior at the school. What does Jack think could be within his grasp? Well, something like his cohort in evil deeds making it possible for the school to reach out with an olive branch and reinstate his teaching position with a provisional clause of course. A large percentage of the narrative is unraveled through the first-person perspective of “Daddy” AKA “Jack” …and was not the “Ripper” of lore nicknamed Jack? Our Jack also daydreams about finishing his book within the walls of the quiet and atmospheric old hotel where royalty and roustabouts alike had stayed. Last on his mental agenda, our “Daddy” AKA “Jack” speculates that there should be time aplenty for him to mend some fences with his emotionally wounded spouse Wendy and their 5-year-old son Danny who adores his “Daddy”. Wendy Torrance wants hubby to accept the proffered appointment as the storied Overlook Hotel’s newest off-season caretaker. Hmmm… It is difficult for the reader to arrive at a different path for the main male character to take. In the matter of the wife Wendy maintaining such a gluttonous amount of cautious optimism within her petite frame is hard to explain to a practical reader. Some amount of her willingness to go is explained by the fact that the alternative is full of bad taste and venom, that is Wendy would need to take “Doc” to her mother’s house. Finally, there is our third family member the couple’s diminutive 5-year-old son Danny who was born with bountiful psychic gifts. The boy wants the right thing for his Daddy, but he has not just misgivings about The Overlook Hotel, but some disturbing psychic information to substantiate his reservations. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old. Any reader of any age with any interest in the horror genre would be both competent and confident enough to spin a decent teaser description of “The Shining” because most horror fans read it at some point, or if not, saw Kubrick’s film adaptation starring the versatile, “can look like a psycho any day of the week”-Jack Nicholson. Personally, I have watched the movie more than once. Haven’t we all? Before going any further in writing my review (trying to think of anything new or different to say when confronted with one and a half-million ratings accompanied by a great number of reviews) I want to be clear that I am not the reviewer who enjoys contrasting the book with the film adaptation(s). At least not when attempting to write a book review. BTW, I want to say how much I liked King’s division of the work using PARTS AND Chapters. In PART ONE while Jack is still at the mercy of what I came to think of as “the mouthpiece” (regurgitating the story of placing every brick of the hotel in excruciating detail) that the pertinent topics of what the requirements of the job for off-season caretaker should be was discussed. And this made for some riveting reading. Ullman recounts his unfortunate decision to hire an alcoholic named Granger for the position and how he lived to regret it. The Granger family was one of the tragedies in the history of the hotel. Delving into IQ, psychosis, cabin fever, and the like, Jack is able to make a case that compares favorably to that of the ill-fated alcoholic named Granger. It was through reading Jack’s true feelings about Ullman (and others) that we come to understand that Jack is much more of a clear and present danger to his wife and child than “simply” an alcoholic. It is pertinent to remember (as Jack holds his rage in check toward Ullman) that he has not had a drink. Jack is afflicted with the most volatile and dangerous psychiatric disorder imaginable in that his rage is only contained with a small safety pin or a piece of tape. In King’s use of the Unreliable Narrator, we learn how easy it is for Jack to believe that he is one Helluva nice guy thirty seconds after he lays someone low. We see, that in Jack’s warped perspective things are done to HIM, he does not do things to others. He sees himself as a good man, husband, and father who only reacts to stimuli that is applied to him. He is a bit of a narcissist, and is devoid of a moral compass. In my opinion, it is only at the 75% mark that things start to simmer, and The Overlook Hotel with all of its negative energy begins to gain momentum and power working through the weakest link. I know I have not mentioned “Dick” Halloran, but readers know that he is one of the players, albeit not a power hitter. The character of Wendy, forgive me, I felt less than warm and fuzzy about on several occasions. I must say that she appeared to be seizing on every opportunity to get all three of them out of the beautiful Colorado Rockies. She should, you say? That was true before they went, or even after they had gone and then the show prevented easy escape. But what about after passing the Rubicon. The” hotel” and its energy was zapping Jack every time it could and if it had NOT been, he would still see that if he pulled the three of them out and abandoned his position as the caretaker then it was all over for him. No money, no job, no book, no fame, no way to make it. The Overlook Hotel comes alive by piggybacking the psychic energy of Doc, the little boy. Wendy, the gentle Halloran, and even the boy’s link to his visions gives the “good guys” aid in the battle. The story is supernatural horrors living in the bowels of the hotel coming into being in this dimension and our little band of heroes taking them on when they are woefully outgunned. “The Shining” was a classic when I read it the first time and allotted the five stars. It is just as stellar the second time around. There is much more detail than I remember, and to be fair, it is a tad too long. But that is a common thread with King’s works. They are lengthy are they not? I am looking forward to the sequel and will read it by the end of this month if at all possible. “The Shining” will never be “dated” or a failure to thrill the young and old alike. It is a wonderful story in King’s quiver of great novels. “THE SHINING”…JUST AS WONDROUS THE SECOND TIME AROUND!!!"
The Shining,"My 200th Review "" Arabic & English "" : 3.5* Knock , Knock ... so it was a hell of a story and it scares the life out of me not coz it's a horror novel , coz in my opinion its not , it go under the genre of a psychological novel . The Shinning most knowable Stephen king novel coz it was on his beginnings after his success in his first novel "" Carrie "" but when the Shinning Released it made king more than a horror novelist . The Story starts With jack in an interview to know about his new job as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel , which he will take of it during the whole winter and also a great start to reconnect with his family and also his writing . so Jack move with his wife Wendy and his son Danny to the new hotel as a fresh start to his life after he lost his job recently but the overlook hotel had other plans for jack and his family . Danny is 6 years old son who got a special gift called The Shinning as Hallorann called it . it's like a gift makes u sees the future and it warns u even Telepathy with other people who have it too , feel the spirit and all of that made Danny Afraid of the hotel and didn't want to go but also he went coz he loves his dad and want to see his family happy again but Danny sees what others can't see . "" But it was a dreadful kind of curiosity, the kind that makes you peek through your fingers during the scariest parts of a scary movie"" The Story is really creepy and King masterwork writing reach the top at it , the way he shows us the problem of the alcoholic people and also how his character keep developing every chapter and the craziness keeps go high with the horror images of jack Internal thoughts of how far the overlook hotel made him lose his mind . But sometimes the novel was monotonous , some chapters events was so slow and it made me get boring a little . The Ending was crazy and frighten in way that makes u had nightmares but over things more than ghosts or beasts , to me nothing worse that the psychological horror .but King gave us the best advice at the end . *** Even Stephen didn't love the movie but Kubrick movie what made the novel even more famous coz it was iconic and a masterpiece , i guess after the ugly series that king made about the shinning in 1997 , he should thank Kubrick in his grave that he made one of best classic movies of all the times no one will forget .

The Shining,"No, I'm not scared right now, you're scared. ...okay, that was really scary."
The Shining,"Yet another book review I’ve been sitting on for weeks, but I feel like I kind of have a good reason this time! Stephen King books are hard to review, both because there’s so much to say but also nothing that hasn’t been said already. And especially since I’ve really only read the most mainstream of his books, including this one, it’s difficult not to be influenced by a cultural impact that’s been around before I was even born. But having nothing new to say has never stopped me before, so why start now! I haven’t seen movie outside of the few famous scenes that have been meme-d to death prior to the internet’s existence. You all know the premise—husband, wife and son move into a big empty hotel, husband goes crazy, wife is screaming, evil ghost twins, elevator of blood, etc. Some of those most iconic moments from the film didn’t actually appear in the novel, and like all adaptations a number of significant book scenes didn’t make the cut. I can’t do a direct comparison because, again, I have not seen the movie, but I also feel as though the complexities of Jack’s relationship with his family were smoothed over during that process too. Because while, yes, is a story about a haunted hotel, its emotional narrative went a lot deeper than that. This is a book about a man so caught up in his own self-aggrandized myth that he would rather burn everything and everybody around him to the ground than have to face his own inadequacies. It was nearly impossible for me to feel anything than complete contempt for Jack Torrance, both before and after he moves into the Overlook Hotel. Was he supposed to be a flawed but still sympathetic character? I’m not sure, but I didn’t have any pity for his situation, only that of Wendy and Danny. In a place filled with actual ghosts and murderous shrubbery, you would think that some of the paranormal aspects would be the scariest parts. But the real horror of lies in the utter familiarity of the type of man Jack Torrance is. How this kind of person believes the ultimate sin in this world that everyone doesn’t stand and applaud his obvious brilliance. And that the world’s indifference or scorn is an unforgivable act that must be punished, violently if necessary, by his own hand. At this point I assume all writers in Stephen King novels are self-inserts on some level, and I see that being the case here. Not necessarily for the , but the parallels between King’s own addiction demons at the time he wrote this. Jack feels like he’s failing his family and failing to live up to his own expectations for himself. It’s hard for him to get back to his work, you know, , and also be the kind of husband and father he always imagined himself as. It would be a lot more relatable, I think, if Jack wasn’t also a piece of shit, but still King seems to give him a pass overall. This book is a product of its time as much as it is a product of its author. Not that was ever acceptable, but it didn’t seem to be a total dealbreaker in redeem-ability in the 70s when this was written. Still, , and that’s for a reason. In the US 88% of homicides are committed by men and 76% of reported domestic violence is committed against women. Wendy and Danny’s terrifying ordeal isn’t necessarily that much of a departure from reality. Other King mainstays, like terrifying kids, a bloated page count, liberal use of the n-word, etc. are all present too. I know the majority of this review has been dissecting Jack and what King was trying to accomplish with his character, but I was still able to sit back and enjoy this book for the most part. It’s scary and unnerving, like feeling someone following you and turning around to find nobody there. If you’re a fan of King’s other books you’ll likely enjoy ."
The Shining,"This was a super entertaining read for me. I just felt like it was a bit long. I often struggle with longer books and so perhaps this is rather my fault, than the novels. When I first tried to read The Shining, probably over 10 years ago, I didn't get very far at all. I didn't give it a fair chance. This time, I think being older has helped as the first time I attempted it, I just wasn't getting it. This time around it made a lot more sense to me. I've also had a little more experience of this sort of genre, reading a few horror books recently. It's also too bad I'm reading this novel so late. I don't think there is anyone who doesn't know something about The Shining, probably from the film. I imagine reading this novel with no prior knowledge would be incredible. After reading this is definitely going on my to read list"
The Shining,"I've set myself a goal to read a few more King works in 2024, as I've enjoyed everything I've picked up by him. He is the king of horror for a reason, and I'm seeing that again with The Shining, possibly his most famous work. Yet again I am astounded by how King manages to craft his characters and the setting in a way where not much happens initially, yet you are fully immersed, and feel yourself getting tenser and tenser. Luckily, I somehow avoided all spoilers for this book, so literally had no idea what it was about. For those who don't know, The Shining is about a married couple and their son moving to look after a hotel during its off-season. But they are not a normal family. The young boy has an uncanny ability of knowing what others around him are thinking, and the father has more than his fair share of secrets weighing on his shoulders. This is about a descent into madness, where the setting becomes a character unto itself. The hotel is a living, breathing space that King remarkably makes feel oppressive to our characters. Whilst the end dragged out a little bit in my opinion, the first three quarters were absolutely incredible, and the end by no means made The Shining less than great."
The Shining,"Hello Readers. Have you heard the tale of the Seven Wives of Bluebeard? Once upon a time there was this powerful noble immensely wealthy.Everyone called him Bluebeard because of his large, ugly blue beard.He had married several times but time and again all of his wives died.No one really knew how. And then one day he married again.A lovely, young girl.Whenever Bluebeard had to go away, he would give her all the keys of his home.He told her she could use any key to go inside which ever room she desired.Except one little key which opened one little door.She was never to use it. She tried to heed his warning.Day after day.Month after month.But at last, she could not stop herself any more.She opened the door with that little key, and looked inside..... ----------------------------- I guess it's human nature.Our inherent morbid curiosity. Mr. King got it perfectly.It was the same morbid curiosity which led our protagonist Danny, to go inside the Room 217.And yup, it was the same one which made me read this book. Hanging inside the room were the heads of the last seven of the Bluebeard's wives. He found...no sorry, that will be a spoiler. Mind numbing, spine chilling terror. I have read horror books before.By God, I have.I've had that phase when R.L.Stine was my best friend.I have read books with these horrifying inhuman, otherworldly creatures. But this book, this book shook me up. Might being the operative word.I'm not really sure. Now as for the story, it needs no introduction.Good for me as I'm not really in the position to describe it now.All I can say is I don't regret reading it.My first Stephen King, there will be many more. -----------------------------------------------------"
The Shining,One of the best horrors I've read (not that I read them too often). Occassionally I like to be scared and while reading The Shining at night I really was. It's a classic for horror lovers.
The Shining,"I envy the soul who hasn't yet watched the 1980 film version of The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick. This may seem an odd thing to covet, considering how terrifying the movie is. Some things you can't unsee and as much as I tried to read the 1977 novel by Stephen King with an open mind, I found myself comparing text to film, discovering elements I wish could've been incorporated into the movie and coming across others I wish the author had omitted at the writing stage. The third novel by Stephen King (following in 1974 and in 1975) begins in the Overlook Hotel, a seventy year old mountain resort in Colorado preparing to close for the winter. Jack Torrance interviews for the job of caretaker. Throughout his meeting with the officious hotel manager Mr. Ullman, Jack is plagued by toxic thoughts, but holds it together long enough to secure the position, a fresh start for the once promising American author and creative writing instructor. Waiting for Jack in Boulder is his wife Wendy, a nervous blonde skittish over the fuel pump in the family VW, skittish over her husband's self-destructive tendencies, skittish over their future and skittish on everything else. Their four-year-old son Danny is uncommonly perceptive and speaks often of an imaginary friend named Tony, a relationship the Torrances attribute to stress. Tony often appears to Danny from far away and shows him things. Tony has a very bad feeling about this place the Overlook. One of the things I love about King and that people who've only heard he's a horror writer might not realize about his work is how little ""horror"" there is in the front half of his books. Jack's abusive father, his own spiral to rock bottom with alcohol and struggles with his temper, as well as his failures as a husband, are explored as deeply as in a work of literary fiction by someone like John Irving. Instead of throwing blood and guts at the reader, King comes at you with his characters. Another thing I've realized about King's best work is that the horror doesn't come from monsters chasing the characters but from characters realizing they are the monster. This is certainly the case in , and with characters realizing they're the freak under the tent and the most terrifying thing going; much of the story deals with whether they can control their wild talent, or the other way around. In , King builds the great haunted house. He gets around the question in all haunted house stories (""Why don't them people just get the hell out?"") by establishing that Jack's failures have his family one temper tantrum away from welfare. The Overlook is a magnificently dreadful place. There are the regal areas the guests see, like the ballroom or the roque court, and the dark places they don't see, like the boiler room and attic. The guest rooms are rich with history. Presidents have stayed at the Overlook, movie stars too, but something else has lingered behind. Children have refused to go in the playground. A chambermaid saw something in the bathtub of Room 217 and was fired for talking about it. A winter caretaker named Delbert Grady went stir crazy and butchered his family with an axe before shooting himself. The Overlook's cook, Dick Hallorann, finds a kindred spirit in Danny with a shared gift his grandmother called ""the shining,"" the ability to see things that happened a long time ago or that may happen yet. Dick doesn't think there's anything in the hotel that could hurt the boy. He doesn't . He advises Danny, ""If there is trouble ... you give a shout."" features some of the scariest shit King has ever put to paper: * Danny's exploration of Room 217 and the thing he finds in the bathtub took me back to being a kid and hearing stories of haunted houses or woods in the neighborhood; I never explored them and after reading this book, am glad I never did. * I liked how Wendy tries to . * The most terrifying thing of all is the thought that your own father, or husband, could slowly lose his marbles and turn into a monster, coming for you. King's toolbox has various sized drill bits he uses to bore clinical psychology into the reader's head. Motivation is clear. Backstory is used wonderfully. Jack and Wendy are loaded with insecurities long before they arrive at the hotel. King illustrates these powerfully and has Danny feed off these self-doubts to form his own unique psychosis. I liked how King uses the construction of an imaginary friend or straw man for Danny to process his visions rather than simply having him have visions. And the story is very grounded in the everyday. Whether touching on domestic abuse, child abuse, alcoholism or emotional instability, King has a sure hand with what should be considered real demons. Comparing the book to the movie. I must say that King wrote a great novel but Kubrick made a landmark film. ++ In the book, Jack's choice of a weapon to is much more organic than the axe he brandishes in the film. ++ Also in King, Jack's unhinged catchphrases, grounded in poison spewed by his own father, are scary. These were not used in the film either. The repetitious way Jack thought about how he was going to finally make his wife or son take their medicine was creepy. -- By far the stupidest thing in the book are the topiary hedge animals, which defy any sort of logic established by King. These bushes apparently have the ability to uproot, stalk their victims, inflict flesh wounds and then return to their spots in the garden. That didn't make the least bit of sense to me. It was probably the biggest story element that the director of and dropped. -- In the book, Danny talks way too much. His dialogue with Dick Hallorann in the kitchen is ten pages long. Though King had a son [Joe Hillstrom] Danny's age at the time he wrote the book, it seemed that Kubrick got far more from the child actor who played Danny in the movie by having him talk less, about his abilities or his experiences. -- In the movie, Danny hides his abilities from his parents because he doesn't want to frighten them. I also found this far more effective. In the book, there are several mother-son conversations about Danny's second sight and even Jack comes to realize his boy has a wild talent. King lays it all out on the surface, too nice and neat for me. -- The climax of the movie is much scarier and has far better visual imagery than horror movie fan King summoned for the book. ++ In the movie, Dick Hallorann is but gets a much happier resolution in the book. I think that King liked this character much more than Kubrick did. +- Wendy is a rag in both versions. She's very much a housewife of the mid-1970s, someone who didn't read in the '60s or go to college, which isn't unrealistic, but makes for an annoying character in a culture where Buffy the Vampire Slayer exists. She just hangs over her husband worrying way too much. -- The epilogue in the book doesn't feel fleshed out. It seems like something King wrote in the office his editor before handing her the manuscript. King has not pulled any punches over the years in his low regard for the choices made by Kubrick, particularly the performance of Jack Nicholson, which is over-the-top from the beginning. Receiving some mixed reviews at the time, the film has gone on to consistently rank as one of the scariest ever made and is regarded as a classic. King got his turn in 1997 adapting the teleplay for a four-hour ABC mini-series starring Steven Weber as Jack and Rebecca DeMornay as Wendy. It does not approach the existential terror of the Kubrick version in any sense. Though the book never fully comes out of the shadow of the movie, I had a wonderful time returning to the Overlook Hotel. I shot through the story, which builds wonderfully. I was invested in how vulnerable Jack grew and how the hotel manipulated that to turn him against the people who depended on him. The hotel was really a stand-in for alcohol and the violence unleashed on his family was very believable to me."
The Shining,"4.5 stars! “Monsters are real. Ghosts are too. They live inside of us, and sometimes, they win.” A family is hired to take care of a hotel over the winter while it is closed to the guests and weather conditions are damning. Jack is hoping to spend the winter as the caretaker working on the hotel and his writing. His wife Wendy wants them to go back to a normal family. Their son Danny has been seeing some very strange things around the hotel. As it grows colder, the hotel starts to come awake and the three of them will be having a very tough time. I���m trying to read King’s books in the order they were published. This was third on the list and since I loved the movie I was excited to read this. I also have seen the hotel that inspired it a few times and have always been meaning to get around to reading this book. This book has what most people would consider a slow start, but I really liked it. King did an incredible job with the setting and the tone and both kept me completely sucked in from the first page. Obviously there were many differences from the movie, I tried not to compare but it’s hard not to. My favorite part about this book was deep inside, this family loved each other very much despite all odds and they tried to keep together as a family unit while outside forces tried to rip them apart. If you haven’t read this book and always meant to (like me) it’s the perfect, spooky time to give it a chance. Just don’t read it before going to bed. Follow me on ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"
The Shining,"I had to wait a week after reading this to write my review. Why? I couldn't fit my computer under my bed with me to type it up. Fricken terrifying. Terrifying! The entire time I spent reading this I felt sick to my stomach with dread. I was jumpy, paranoid, the whole shamboozle. King really gets into your head with this... He takes you right into the character's subconscious, and as they are slowly driven bonkers, are driven bonkers right along with them. Is it sad that even though I knew it couldn't possibly end well, that I still hoped maybe it would? Probably not, I'm sure a lot of people felt like that. Is it sad that I like to pretend it ended differently than it did, so I can feel less stressed when I think of it? Probably so. It's not that I didn't like the ending.. I did. It was perfect. It's just... It was stressful, ok? Let me live in denial! I'm happy there! Er.. Back to the review. I really don't know what else to say! A year ago if you asked me if I would ever read The Shining the answer would have been an emphatic ""HELL NO"". Too scary. Not interested. But I was talked into reading it, even though I feared it would eat my soul. But as you can see from my five star rating, I don't regret it. My soul may be covered in itty bitty chew marks now, but it was worth it to experience King at his best."
The Shining,"This was me during most of the book: 4 out of 5 stars! one of the best books I've ever read and one of the scariest. I'll talk more about it in my October Wrap Up. If you've been wanting to check it out, I'd say DO IT."
The Shining,"Still one of the best horror books I’ve ever read, and my favourite horror movie, though the book is slightly different from the movie but both are EPIC!!"
The Shining,"Have you ever been building up to something so much that when you finally get to that thing, it just doesn’t satiate you? Has it ever been the case with you where the people around you say such spectacular shit about a thing that it seems that you’ve hit the HOLY FUCKING GRAIL, and yet, yet when you finally hold that thing in your hands, it seems overrated..?? Calls to mind a line from a song by POTF, “It’s how we ” This has been my experience with . For the longest time I can remember, I’ve been searching for a proper HORROR novel that’d make my spine tingle just a bit. That’d make me feel a little more afraid of the dark than I usually am. This search led me to series. While this series has been definitely my most cherished read so far, it was never a true HORROR novel. So the search continued… All my friends, who share my love for books, suggested that I go a-knocking on the fabled doors of SK and seek the HOLY GRAIL of HORROR that is this book. Everyone told me, and I quote, . So, after an ample number of suggestions, I did just that. I picked it up. By that time, I had had my 1st taste of the many delicacies that SK has dished out, in form of Mr. Mercedes. So I knew he lacked nothing as a story teller and all that was left was the story itself. I was ready and hoping for some spine tingling. The story itself is pretty straight forward, a basic necessity even, for all things HORROR, books and movies alike. A small family that has an unpleasant past, bad blood between the members and on the verge of falling apart. But they want to hold on to each other and thus look for a fresh start. A new beginning that requires them to move to a new house, a hotel in this case. A place that, as it turns out, is HAUNTED, always is. Add to that a psychic or clairvoyant kid, who is young enough to be influenced and scared by the supernatural powers and entities. An empathetic figure who is willing to help this family in trouble. Together they fight their way out of a Supernatural battle and persevere, coming out with minimal damage. This is your standardized recipe and all you need in addition to this is a modicum of decent writing capabilities and , you have a good enough horror novel. But all this doesn’t necessarily apply to this book and it doesn't mean I Hated the book or didn’t like it. I did. Thoroughly enjoyed it, as a matter of fact. You ask why..?? Let me tell you in 2 words: Coz its . Well, yeah ok, that was more than 2 words but what the heck..?? It is the sheer brilliance of the writing style that makes this book worth it and makes it stand out in a crowd of similar books. The thing I have come to love about this author, is the fact that he very subtly lets you inside the head of the characters. He sounds like the person whose narrative you are reading at that time. Say one chapter is from a kid’s perspective, you will feel that immaturity, lack of knowledge and resources that a 5 year old would have. Say one chapter is from the Mother’s perspective, you get to feel the underlying feminine voice that makes the character seem real. You can sense that motherly love for a child that only a mother can have. That ""Hate to Love"" and ""Love to Hate"" relation that a wife has with her husband. In effect, SK brings the characters to LIFE, he makes you believe that the people, even as fucked up as his characters, can be real, alive, talking and walking on the face on the Earth. This holds true for all his books I’ve read so far. In the end, it’s as simple as this: The way a story is TOLD, holds much more sway on the readers and listeners than just the story itself. And I personally believe that this is exactly what makes him a top notch storyteller. If you haven’t read this book so far, I suggest you set aside a weekend and get on with it. All SK books beg to be read and what delights they are. I think, I may have found, even if only temporarily, my go to author, a writer I can turn to after a disappointing read, a writer that I can count on to deliver a brilliantly told story that I can relish. Though a sad truth, the fact remains, that while I absolutely loved it, I wasn’t quite scared by the book. And so, my search for a book that will scare me, still goes on… Hoping and praying that soon I meet with the book that gives me the chills. Keep reading, CIAO..!!"
The Shining,"Take a father who recently lost his job and has, amongst some other things, a drinking problem. A mother who thought about divorcing him already and has a problematic relationship with her own parents. And their young son who can see things. Then put them into a secluded hotel high up the Colorado Rockies, which is closed for the winter and has a rather peculiar history of its own. Put this into the hands of Stephen King and watch the madness unfold. King is very good at finding horror in the most mundane things and he’s also good at creating unstable characters and let them destabilize further throughout his stories. He makes good use of his talents here. Plotwise there’s not that much happening, actually. It’s all about the characters and the slow deterioration of their state of mind. But that’s not a problem if the author is able to create so much atmosphere and the characters are strong enough to carry the narrative. And they are. King was able to give them depth and he explores themes like alcoholism, child abuse, insecurity, isolation, how we deal with personal failure and especially how our past shapes our present. So I did enjoy this read for the most part. But not from start to finish. Because I’m not a big fan of the paranormal. And this plays a huge role especially in the second half of the book, while I personally wished the craziness would have solely originated from the characters’ minds. So towards the end this almost steered into 3 star territory, which, of course, would still be good. But I decided to go with 4 stars, because it is very well written was enthralling for most of the time. I alternated between the ebook (in English) and the audiobook (a German translation). And I highly recommend the audio version. Because it is all about the characters gradually going crazy. And with a good narrator this can be a lot of fun. Dietmar Wunder is a good narrator and from what I’m hearing Campbell Scott is as well. The audiobook actually offers quite a few jump scares and is best to be enjoyed late at night with lights out and no one around. Creeptastic!"
