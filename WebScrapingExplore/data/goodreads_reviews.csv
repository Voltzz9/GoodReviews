Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is based on a television series which can be viewed on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfB-p... This is a really remarkable series and a remarkable, although annoying, book. The book is annoying because it should have been a coffee table book with large colour photographs and large font – instead it is a Penguin paperback with a font tending towards the unreadable and grey scale reproductions of the paintings that make them almost impossible to view. This is agonising, as really all you will want to do is studying and think about these images for hours. There is something we sort of know, even if I suspect we are completely wrong in our intuition. We have been, as humans, looking at pictures for a lot longer than we have been reading books. For the vast majority of us, literacy is a disturbingly recent invention – perhaps a hundred , maybe a hundred and fifty years for people in the first world. Churches told their Biblical stories as much in images as in words. For a long time even here the words were spoken in a language that was not understood by those listening. Learning how to read images, something so many of us assume isn’t something we need to learn, but rather is somehow immediate, takes an entire culture and also takes perhaps as long as to learn how to read. To understand how images work on us – how we are manipulated by them – that takes at least as long as it takes to learn the same things about how words work on and manipulate us. So, on one level this book is an exploration of the history of oil painting and what such paintings ‘mean’ – mean to us now in comparison to what they meant to earlier generations of people in Western societies. Because the Western tradition of painting is quite a separate thing from any other ‘world art’ traditions. He starts by saying that paintings are both still and silent. This is an interesting thing to say, because how we generally experience paintings today – or at least, learn about them – is through shows like Sister Wendy’s World Tour of Art or Simon Schama’s Power of Art. Don’t for a second get me wrong here – I loved both. But the art works displayed are anything but still or silent. There is a voice track and there is a panning and a zooming-in that turns these still and silent works into something approaching a cartoon. I had never considered the implications of this before. The painting stops being what it is, in fact, cannot remain what it is on the screen, it stops being an object that the artist created so as to speak for itself, and now requires someone to mediate between it and us, to either speak over it (explain it) or to orchestrate it (quite literally, with music) so that we are taught the proper way to read this painting. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we ‘read’ paintings and images, particularly after reading a book called Reading Images: the grammar of visual design. It is interesting that in that book it is clear that linguistic grammar has been used as a way to structure our response to the grammar of images – quite effectively, I think – but this is almost counter-intuitive. If we have had a more immediate relationship with images than with written text, why is it that we need to use the organising principles associated with written texts so as to seek to understand images? Why doesn’t that work the other way around? I know in part this is because language has been formally codified, but this, again, raises the question of why images are so resistant to such codification. Why would it be daft to explain what a verb is by reference to Mona Lisa’s eyebrows? The relationship between being naked (being without clothes) and being nude is presented here in what I take to be feminist art criticism. A nude is not merely someone without clothes – it is almost invariably a female and she is also on display, an object. In many ways she is not really the protagonist of the painting, even when she is the only person in the painting – the other person that is always present is the anonymous male viewer towards whom she is on display. He shows image after image of nude women, and even while being embraced, they are turned to the viewer, turned to their true lover, their fantasy lover, for not only are they the screen on which we project our lust, but also the reason for our weaknesses – they are, in the end, to be lusted over and to blame. No wonder they are invariably passive and languid. After corrupting the whole of male humanity, how could they not look exhausted? And that is actually the point – it is only today that a painting can be seen by quite so many people. They were never intended to be seen other than by the very few. Today paintings are pretty much what Plato said of them, representations of representations – but as such they are a demonstration of just how wealthy the owner really was. Paintings put on display the wealth of their owners – and that was a large part of what had been their purpose. Here’s me, and here’s the missus, and we are standing in front of our house, this is our bedroom, these are the oranges we have shipped in from Spain, this is our cow and, despite the late summer sun setting, these are our furs. The last program in the series looks at advertising and how it uses and distorts the language of paintings, to which it is the last dying breathe of a tradition spanning back 500 years. In oil painting we are looking at the current wealth of the owners – there is a now-ness about these paintings – this is what I look like now, this is what I own now – the fact that it is always ‘then’ in images is something everyone has become more aware of now we have cameras and something Barthes explains beautifully in his Camera Lucida. Time stops in the image, and as such all images are images of death. Life immediately marches away from them, leaving them as pure memory. So, paintings are always about the present and, as such, thus also immediately about the past – the present being just the past in waiting. But marketing images are always about the future, never about the present. Selling something is about creating a desire and that desire is not here and now, it is sometime soon. In many ways advertising doesn’t sell products – it sells envy and desire. As he points out, the rich people in oil paintings are not glamorous – glamour is beside the point. To be glamorous the viewer needs to want to emulate the people they see in the images – but the people who own paintings see themselves – so, there is no need for glamour. To sell product you need to sell a fantasy and that fantasy needs to be just out of reach, but obtainable though an exchange not actually part of the image, an exchange of money for a good, but that exchange is the point of the image. That capitalism needs such constant exchanges and that advertising creates the desires that fuel these exchanges is the open secret of our society. That said, I’d never considered the relationship with time that this creates before – how, to be economically valid units, we need to be constantly living in a fantasy future, while also being prepared to put up with just about any boredom in our all too prosaic present. No wonder advertisement is uninterested in now, it needs to be – it needs to negate now for what is to come. The book also draws a distinction between how we advertise to the working class (the promised transformation is based on Cinderella) and the middle class (the promised transformation is based on The Enchanted Palace) – for the working class buying this one product will be enough to transform you into the princess, for the middleclass investing in this bank will bring you all of the good things in life, which are, of necessity, an ensemble. There is so much to think about in this tiny book and this short series of films. I watch shows like this and I think, imagine what television could have been – but, of course, it could never have been anything of the kind. This is very much the exception that proves the rule. So, to see what television could never have been allowed to be, watch this and then go back to reading books."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I am not the audience for this book, mainly because I've already read and more or less digested the handful of essays and ideas on which it is based. The seven chapters break down fairly simply. 1: Benjamin's 'Work of Art'--the ability to reproduce images alters the way we encounter works of art. This seems reasonable. Nobody gets to see a Giotto without having seen a reproduction first, except someone who has no interest in the Giotto in the first place. But Berger et al* go a step further: we need to use the fact that we encounter works of art differently to undermine the ruling class's privilege and the ""specialized experts who are the clerks of the nostalgia of a ruling class in decline."" That's on page 32. Part of me, a large part, laments the fact that you'd never get that published today, not even on a website. Another part of me laments the stupidity of intellectuals who put their faith in the inherent goodness of The People. The People does not have a good track record when it comes to art appreciation. That's not to say that people can't learn to appreciate art, only that We are no better and no worse than the ruling class was. We need to learn, we need to be taught, you can't do that if you assume that We are inherently able to do the right thing. 2 & 3: Women are depicted differently from men, and, frankly, not in ways that are healthy for anyone, but particularly not for women. I agree. Which makes it breathtaking to see the authors get so many things wrong, either intentionally (cutting short the bible verse in which God punishes Eve *and Adam*); stupidly (non-Western art forms show women as active participants in sex, so that are isn't morally dubious); or in ways that are, ahem, temporally bound (""Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion."" Seventies!). 5: Oil paintings are bourgeois and generally not morally okay. Holbein's 'Ambassadors' is read as an example of this; the incredible distorted skull in the painting is the exception which proves the rule of oil paintings rather than, you know, showing that oil paintings can be self-critical, as are most good artworks of any kind. In general, the lesson of this book is that all art is bad for you, except the pieces that the authors of this book like. They like pieces by artists who can plausibly be turned into radicals, because only radicals can be interesting (Franz Hals; William Blake). They don't discuss the 20th century at all (I know they know that twentieth century art exists; perhaps, as good Benjaminian Marxists, they don't like abstraction or difficulty). They're also very uncomfortable with religious art, and want to group, e.g., Ambrosius Benson's Mary Magdalene with the absurd and/or pornographic Magdalene of later times, rather than admitting the rather obvious differences (Benson's is rich, but not, how can I put this... naked and disheveled.) Since the authors have a hard time saying what they actually like (vs. what they suspect is oppressive), you get idiocies like this: Rembrandt's famous late portrait shows a man for whom ""all has gone except a sense of the question of existence, of existence as a question."" A little thought would show that this is the sort of conservative pablum Great Artists have been serving up for generations. 6 & 7: Advertizing uses art to make you think you want things you don't want and that you can get them, so you don't need to think about what you really want, e.g., more time away from the office. This is true. In sum: I was sucked in by the idea that this was a book about understanding art. It is not. It is critical theory for high-school readers. Good for what it is, but extremely narrow in scope, and quite harmful for anyone who swallows it whole rather than taking a few minutes to worry away at its assumptions. Harmful because those who accept it will say silly things, and because those who read it and reject it out of hand (due to the rhetoric, bad arguments, or conceptual confusion) won't be challenged to, you know, care about other people. * Humorous aspect of this book: it makes a big deal about how it was written by a group of people, because, you know, individuals are bad, and groups are good. You'll note that the book is sold as a book by John Berger. You can draw the conclusion."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"First of all, this entire book is set in bold. I don't know what crazy crazyman let that through the gate at Penguin but I just felt I had to point it out right away. It's still worth reading. 4 essays and 3 pictorial essays. Really interesting stuff cutting away some of the bullshit associated with our appreciation of art. It seems like museums are doing a lot of things wrong as well as right. Chapter on oil-painting was particularly interesting but it was the last one about advertising (or ""publicity"" as it's exclusively referred to in this book) that has me thinking. Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it's thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that's grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was a great introduction to the work of John Berger, and my doubts that this would turn into something rather dull were swiftly blown away. His approach to art isn't overly complex thus you don't have to be a cultural boffin on the subject, yet its deep on a theoretical level to challenge and stimulate the old grey matter. Ways of Seeing offers not just an idea but also an invitation to see and know the world differently. As the TV series aired in 1972 (four years before I was born) I will likely turn to youtube and try to catch an episode or two, and hopefully find it as fascinating as this book. Bravo John!"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Almost laughably disappointing. Berger obviously has the best of intentions, but his analysis is amateurish at best, pathetically reactionary (almost to the point of seeming to whine) at worst, and largely cribbed from thinkers of far greater intellectual originality and power than himself. For starters, he seems either ignorant of or unwilling to admit that what we broadly call 'mainstream visual art' is, was, and quite likely almost always has been directly tied up with wealth; with commissions, patronage, really with human commerce itself. Visual art isn't some pure, 'virginal' endeavor sullied by capitalism. Visual art is a creative activity which is intimately tied into and dependent on capitalism (really, on wealth) in the first place... and with displaying and re-affirming that wealth. His naive disgust with modern capitalism's collusion with art assumes that there was some magical time when art existed in a vacuum of economic/ideological purity, unsullied by the lucre of having to actually pay someone to produce a canvas or carve a church door or gild something. If such 'pure' art even exists in the first place, Berger provides literally no evidence for it: no examples from non-western European, 'traditional' cultures or even folk arts which might conceivably hint that some people make art for nothing more than their own personal pleasure. As if his shallow reading of these issues wasn't bad enough, he then goes on to make the utterly ludicrous claim that portraits of women, nudes, etc, show us that all women everywhere (and only ever women) are essentially shaped (really, he means warped) by the erotic gaze of male longing and domination. That's a powerful idea. It's also utterly indemonstrable and reeks of cheap psycho-analysis. Worse than that...it's a theory concocted to explain and reduce the female experience, which to be sure, has been cruelly unfair for the vast majority of human history, down into a narrow category of sexual expectation. Has John Berger ever MET an actual woman? What could be more bigoted, what could be more misogynistic, than dismissively generalizing all members of the female sex as simply 'damaged' by the male gaze, as if a single tiny statement was enough to claim to understand the full totality of the female experience and female suffering through out history? And of course, his visual examples of this are, again, cheaply cherry picked...just a few nudes (which to be sure, are pathetically offensive). Berger manages the odd feat of trying to empathize with the female subject in art and somehow making himself come across as an arrogant misogynist in the process. The problem with this book is that underneath it's crummy pseudo-analysis is a person who already knows how the world is to such a level of satisfaction that he has nothing left to discover or even really demonstrate about it. Capitalism? Oh it's ruined art. (Never mind telling us about what art from a non-capitalist culture is like) Women? Oh the poor things, they're so warped by male expectations its a miracle they can even stand up (Never mind that you don't relate any actual woman's experience at any point). Photography? Oh that's ruined art too by making images ubiquitous (never mind really examining photography fairly to see the myriad ways it has changed modern culture and modern art) This book proves one thing above all: the complacent intellectual smugness of the person who wrote it. Look, the relationship between the commercial world and the ever-changing world of visual artistic endeavor is a hugely diverse and complicated subject, as is the relationship between art and advertising. As is, especially, the relationship between gender roles and visual art through out history. Thinkers as diverse as Susan Sontag, Walter Benjamin, Virginia Woolf, Naomi Klein, etc. have all written elegantly and movingly about these topics. John Berger's ""Ways of Seeing"" tries to stand on the shoulders of such thinkers and falls off on nearly every page. Largely because the only thing Berger seems to 'see' is his own self-satisfaction."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Interesting little book. The author’s matter-of-factness annoyed me at times and I had the sense that he kept looking for the worst in the human nature of artists, art owners and consumers alike. If nothing else, he gives us food for thought. I enjoyed the essay on publicity images the most. For what it’s worth, I couldn’t help comparing Berger’s view that to that of Don Draper’s, leading character and quintessential ad-man of Madmen, as is expressed on the Netflix trailer: I agree with both but the latter is kinder."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On the top floor in the Strand Bookstore in New York, I saw a self-consciously bored worker show a struggling-to-be-bored kid with his mom to the art table. The worker was like ""well, you need this, and this, and this"" and I realized the kid must be in art school and the worker must have graduated pretty recently. The worker was like ""have you read Ways of Seeing? By John Berger?"" and wanted to have geeky enthusiasm, but kept her eyes half closed and only lifted the book two inches. The kid was like ""no, what is that?"" and trying not to care. The worker was like, totally monotone, ""well, it's really amazing. You'll have to read that. Everyone reads it. Anyway, it's awesome."" Then they went away and I picked it up, because I would like to go to art school, learn 1,000 techniques and become spiritually fulfilled, kind, married, a terrific cook, and understand flowers etc. and make informative life-affirming web shorts that are not irrelevant. In the bookstore, Ways of Seeing was boring but I decided it was my fault. Months later, I found it in a library in Santa Cruz, California. It is printed in bold type for no reason. I guess it is interesting. Oil paintings were about conspicuous consumption back in the day. Only women are conscious about what they present to the world looks-wise. Fetishizing the past helps aristocrats stay aristocrats. Capitalists turned art into a commodity. This is apparently all pulled from a BBC special which I bet is more interesting. At a certain point in your life this will BLOW YOUR MIND, but if you know in your heart that one day we will all hate stainless steel kitchens and be like ""ugh, so old fashioned, barf"" you will probably be like ""yeah, this was okay."""

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"John Berger’s Ways of Seeing, based on a four-part 1972 BBC documentary series of the same name, is considered one of the most influential and accessible works of writing about art in the English language — and rightly so. Consisting of four textual essays and three picture essays bereft of text, this book deconstructs the dominant cultural ‘gaze’ towards art and connects it with the way we regard and ascribe meaning, both to works of art and to the world around us. Particularly insightful, even path-breaking, is the essay on the tradition of the Nude and how it relates to the power (and gender) dynamics between the surveyed and the surveyor. It is here that Berger illustrates the social existence of men as subjects and women as objects: The distinction created here between nakedness and nudity is also notable: One of the most important tasks performed in is that it democratises art and meaning-making, freeing it from the mystification of the art-critic and the exclusive enjoyment of the status-quo (a function also performed, albeit differently, by the invention of camera and the possibility of reproduction – both ideas dealt with in the first essay in this volume). I also found the essay on the Publicity Image and Advertising to be a particularly important theoretical intervention, revealing publicity as both a tradition of continuity and a break from the oil painting as a methodical construction of a new aspirational way of seeing (while seeing the same things: prosperity and happiness), situating envy and glamour as its centerpiece. Despite being written in the 1970s, continues to be a thoroughly important and relevant read, well into the second decade of the 21st century. I would, however, advise a word of caution with regards to its eurocentrism (and certain incorrect notions about art in the East, especially with regards women and sexuality) in some places. Given that one of the chief aims of this book is to demystify and democratise art appreciation, it makes sense that this book appears as a paperback instead of the more thematically-appropriate coffee-table format. However, what makes no sense whatsoever is that the entire book is set in a headache-inducing bold sans-serif font. My second reading of this book was from an e-copy, but the typeset was still bold and only marginally less annoying. Moreover, I’m glad that I read this in an age when paintings can be looked up on the internet, because the miniature black-and-white reproductions printed in the book are barely decipherable, let alone offering a chance for the kind of assessment this book recommends. The Penguin paperback edition of is paradoxically at odds with the book’s intrinstic argument for accessibility; a visual iteration of the value-divide between authors and publishers if you will."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice."" An indispensable starting point for anyone who wants to think deeply about visual art, its meanings, and its uses in the (post)industrial age. If you're an art lover like I am (my ""art"" tag on a certain largely-defunct blogging platform runs to something like 1,300 images, for an account I started less than two years ago) is both troubling and extremely enriching. Troubling because it's impossible not to feel uneasy once you start acknowledging the commodity status which is inherent to virtually all ""high"" art produced in the age of capitalism, whether it be an oil painting commissioned by a successful merchant in 1671 to gratify his vanity and affirm his perception of the world, or a more contemporary piece fated to become a sort of monetary storage unit for the obscenely wealthy, regardless of the artist's intent or the conditions in which it was created. (Though Berger is more concerned with older works in this short book.) Troubling also because of the ease with which artistic iconography can be used to mold subconscious perceptions, to enforce entrenched attitudes and prejudices, and to lend authority to advertisements and propaganda. (For instance, there's an excellent and much-quoted essay here on the patriarchal function of ""the nude"" in western art.) Yet enriching because—well, to start with, it's always good to be attuned to the realities of the world one lives in, unpleasant or not. But also because Berger himself is not a Hater of Art or anything ridiculous like that: he simply wants us to be smarter about the way we engage with images, to internalize the notion that works are shaped by the context in which they are created and viewed, and to start to be able to pick out what is truly innovative or inspired or subversive in the visual arts by way of a contrast with what is hackneyed, safe, or insidious. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the book's origins as a TV special, Berger is about as clear and direct a prose stylist as can be imagined, and provides some great illustratory images if you can find a copy that doesn't shrink and drain them of color. (I highly recommend reading the book , where the pics are large and vibrant.) Actually, about half the essays are entirely pictorial, chains and collages of images which we are invited to fill in with our own interpretations and associations. The whole thing could be grasped by a teenager and read in an afternoon, which is not to say that it's rudimentary or unserious. It's definitely not. I've been depressed lately by discussions I've run into online about art and ideology, particularly regarding ""modern"" (i.e. abstract expressionist) works: conversations which, like so much web discourse, tend to drain the topic of all nuance and complexity in the rush to arrive at the most ""correct"" and politically defensible position. The advent of NFTs and the emergence of art-generating AI software are also spurring plenty of fervent discussion across the web; in other words, the nature and ethics of visual art are very far from settled issues. Though Berger himself sticks mostly to the block of centuries post-Renaissance and pre-photography, it was refreshing to be reminded of how good these kinds of conversations be, when facilitated by someone who knows what they're talking about and wants to encourage thoughtful examination rather than algorithmic engagement. If for my own part I've been vague about what he actually has to , it's only because I'd rather not summarize such an already-concise and graspable work. Please read it if you can. As for me, I think it's time to dig into some ."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“There is more than meets the eye” I recently reread Kenneth Clark's Civilization. It was based on a British documentary TV series, from the end of the 1960s. In it Clark offers a very own, but still fairly classic introduction to art. The book of John Berger (1926-2017) and the accompanying TV-series (look it up on You Tube!) was released in 1972 and was the antipode of Clark’s. Berger looked at the works of art very differently, or more correctly: he looked at the way we ""see"" very differently. To start with, he makes the reader-viewer aware of the world behind the artworks, the social context in which they came about. It is an exquisite analysis that he borrows from philosopher Walter Benjamin. Knowing that the 17th-century Dutch painter Frans Hals, for example, lived in bitter poverty when he painted group portraits of well-off citizens, does indeed make you look at those works of art very differently. With this other approach, Berger knocked down quite some sacred houses, especially those of traditional art critics and their emphasis on the creative genius and timelessness of works of art. He was forcefully criticized for it, but it must be said that he himself did not shy away from sharp polemics, also in this booklet. But Berger offers more: he also shows that ‘seeing’ happens in a specific, social context. His analysis of how women take into account how they are viewed (especially by men) is particularly lucid and unfortunately still topical. The way in which publicity influences and manipulates our visual language is also aptly articulated and represented. Berger also demonstrates the enormous impact of new techniques (reprography and the camera in Berger's time), making artworks available permanently and everywhere, regardless of their context, and therefore they are seen in a different way than before. I can imagine that 50 years ago this little book was a real eye-opener (pun intended). Nevertheless, during the reading, the impression came to me that the work is not really fresh anymore. Perhaps that is because a number of his views have since become commonplace. Perhaps it is also due to the layout of the booklet, with small black-and-white illustrations. But probably it’s Berger's rather classic marxist discourse that makes it seem a bit outdated: using words such as ""capitalist exploitation of the masses"", ""deprivation"" and ""proletariat"" now, in the 21st century, seems quite dated and even touching.

It is composed of seven essys, four use words and images, three only images. It discusses how women are view in society with an emphasis and concentration on European or Western culture. The images are from ads and famous European paintings. Being that I work in a museum and see paintings all day long this aspect interests me in particular. Basically the book is saying that in our European based culture women are objects, men are subjects. Men survey, women are surveyed. Since women are always on display in our society, they adjust their behaviour in order to please and fit in with our male dominated society. I reference this book many times in my own personal writings. What Mr. Berger has written still has value today. Actually in many ways not much has changed for women. We in the USA and Western Europe are a little better off because we can work, make money and have legal rights but that is not true for women in the rest of the world. Living in a Democratic or secular society does give women more control over their lives as opposed to dictatorships and theocracies. However even in the United States our actions as women and men are based on social constructs and society's defintions of how men and women should behave towards each other. Even how women view and interact with each other to the point that women are very competitive, jealous and vindictive in order to get or keep a man. But that is another story for discussion in the essays I have written."

The theories presented are very interesting and are posed with pictorial references that do very well to prove points. One interesting chapter deals exclusively with the 'Nude' in art overtime. Overtime it has been reviled, reveared, copied, censored, hidden, hoarded and abstracted. Another great chapter deals in the context in which people see art, in contrast to how they might have been meant to see it by the artist. Many pieces are painted as singular wall decorations, but now are hanging in museums next to a hundred other of these decorations. Overtime people now view art online or in sections of video, where a director controls the viewers eyes as what to see through camera tricks and narration. The chapter contemplates and guesses how this might change to experience of art over time. Changing from entertainment, to a more scholarly subject. A very interesting read."

Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.” The first essay concerns how much a person's perspective is subject to change based on their surroundings and how the reproduction of art (alias photography) has negatively impacted the collective art-viewing experience. One can easily draw a parallel between this experience and the movie-going experience: how watching a movie amongst an audience is vastly different from watching it at your leisure on your couch. The essay also criticizes the imposing and more-often-than-not pseudo-intellectual culture of over-analysis of paintings. The irony, however, lies in the fact that Berger, while not empathetic with indulgent criticism, most of the time scribes down his thoughts with a definitive, autocratic tonality. The second essay talks about the male gaze. In doing so, the tone often trod the fine line between factual and sexist, but in the end, succeeded in convincing us that the author only wanted to say that it is the way it is. Nudist craft has, for decades, been invariably about the female body and hence, has remained more about objectification than anything else. The third one addresses the capitalist mentality from the 15th and 16th centuries regarding oil painting and how art regressed into merely a byproduct of consumerism. The last one retains as a continuation of that and addresses publicity and talks more in-depth about consumerist psychology, how it is a ramification of envy rather than greed. The prose is rather grandiose and, as I felt, often indulgent. It shows more than it tells (no pun intended), and while it is evident that Berger's knowledge of Western art and culture is quite astute, his text remains woefully ignorant of Orientalist art. There are maybe a couple of mentions thrown here and there, and while there's nothing wrong with a book being only about Western art, there's something definitely wrong with generalizing based on that. Also, this should've been a coffee table book. of"

I got this as a present today, and have spent the day, on and off, reading it (between cake and beer and garden sunshine). This is usually regarded as the 'most influential' book on art ever, or at least one of them. Berger writes in a clean, no-nonsense kind of way. Despite discussing nudity in art, or the history of art, or discussing the paintings printed in the book, it's never hard to follow. I suppose someone with even no background interest in art could read it without any trouble. That being said, without any interest in art, I'd say this book wouldn't be for you. Though the book is 'Ways of Seeing' - that is very much in relation to art. A more suitable name may be 'Ways of Seeing '. Though, the final essay on capitalism/consumerism and publicity is very interesting, whatever your passions are. But, as for me, an art lover, I found this deeply insightful and fascinating. And Berger's writing was just an added bonus as he takes us on this short romp through art. There are many reproductions of art inside, and for some reason, the text is all bold. Not sure whose bright idea that was."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I admit I’m not well-versed in art history and theory, so that may be a reason this book affected me so deeply, but I was really struck by these essays. They’re incisive. They’re structured well. And they truly made me think. They made me think about art as a sign, a symbol, an argument, a brag, a promise, a prison. Berger is very clear about his purview here, which I appreciate. Though he mentions photography and advertising and film, and he draws contrasts to sculpture and Eastern art, the real subject of analysis is European oil paintings and, by extension, the rise of capitalism. There are both visual and written essays, and while I was initially wary about how well an essay told only through images would work, I was quickly won over. My favourite written essays were about representations of women and nudity—touching on appearance, agency, sight, maleness as the norm—and the final essay on advertising, which Berger refers to as “publicity”—touching upon classism, envy, glamour, desire, materialism, and commodification. Comparatively, my problems are rather slight. The book is set entirely in bold, which is weird. The cover is hideous; whose idea was it to just paste the first few paragraphs of the essay right onto the cover?! The images are in tiny and black and white and in some of the visual essays they run across the crease of the spine, rendering them nearly indiscernible. But I think my only criticism of the content itself is that Berger has a tendency to make some pretty definitive declarations, especially about what is and is not “exceptional.” Take this statement from p. 103: “Adriaen Brouwer was the only exceptional ‘genre’ painter.” Hmmm. Berger backs this statement up, of course, and explains why Brouwer was different from his contemporaries, but that doesn’t make it any more than an opinion presented as a fact, which rubs me the wrong way. The best thing I can say about a collection of essays is that it changed my way of thinking—my way of seeing!—and that is undoubtedly true with this book. There are layers to art criticism that never crossed my mind, layers far beyond and beneath the purely aesthetic, and I’ll be thinking about these things next time I visit an art museum. I’ll be asking questions like: who was this painted for? Who and what are the subjects? How are the people looking at me, the observer, and how are they arranged to appeal to or challenge my point of view? What sort of place would this have been hung in before it was brought to this museum? And who would have been looking at it there? And what would they have hoped to show to people who visited their home or abbey or office, to make them feel? More often than not, according to Berger, the answer to the last question is envy."

Link to the documentary (which I definitely recommend you watch to supplement the reading of the text): Will add my proper in-depth review of this later (as it really does deserve one). For now, I will just say that Berger makes us think: he makes us think about the impact of images, their history, their place in society and their role in furthering capitalist agendas. He makes us think about the image of women, the role they play in the system, the condition of modern galleries and museums, and most importantly, Berger makes us think about the modern day photograph and what it means for as a functioning member of society - it's all very insightful and he demystifies art in a fashion which is simple to understand as far as theory goes. Very marxist in his views and vocabulary (which I know will bother some) but I enjoyed that part hah."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"All of what I picked up from this atrocity of a Book is that John Berger is a pretentious cunt. He hides behind the fact that he states he's ""demystifying"" art when in actuality he's giving you his opinion on the propaganda of art and how the artist doesn't exist. I must say first and foremost I am a huge believer in the auteur theory and author's/artist's purpose, so this is why I am opposed to this book. Berger is merely under the assumption that all art is just a way for the elite white male population to flaunt and reassure themselves that they are superior to the plebeians. I'm paraphrasing of course, but this book clearly undermines the intent of the artist. In this book Berger devalues the artist by saying that their creations are merely a tool for the elite to flaunt their wealth, as is expected from a contextualist. He only gives credit to the ""masters"" of the medium. Whom he states surpassed all the average form of art by going outside the boundaries of standard commissioned art (Such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, etc). Berger also has the problem of most contextualists, by which I mean he tries to find meaning or more accurately make up meaning whenever possible. One of the finest examples of this is when he described a simple livestock oil painting as, and I quote ""furniture with four legs in the eyes of the viewer that emphasizes the social status of their owners."" Which honestly might have some truth to it, but is more likely a showing of the owner's connection with nature or the artist's connection or attempt to bring together animals and people into the same composition. Essentially what I'm saying is that Berger's book might appeal to contextual art historians, feminists and socialists, but I feel it lacks any serious criticism or review on art as a whole. It is less of a book about how to see art and more a way to simplify art as a commodity for wealthy, sex-driven, elitist men."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I first read the book in 2000 as a young freshman in a class on Popular Culture and Ideology. I remember being overwhelmed by the wonderful insights of this book. Now, more than 20 years later, I can still appreciate the book, while at the same time being a bit more skeptical of its insights...and at the same time wondering if it can speak to the current moment in history. If I had to sum up the book in a few short sentences it would be this: Paintings and pictures are always for something and someone. Often, paintings and pictures express the desires of capital and the ruling class. When the artist does get a moment of triumph over the medium and its language of power, it is often a hard fought and meager one. Perhaps that short summary has done some lasting epistemic damage to the book and its meaning. After all, one of the lessons of critical works such as Berger's is that life, power, and imagery is never so simple. And yet, in my middle age years, I feel like I need critical and postmodern scholars to be less baroque in their insights and more modern. The short summary, the abstract, with all its obfuscating simplicity is needed in order to give a very ""modern"" sense of order to the world. At a time when conspiracy theories and epistemic anarchy is spreading, I wonder what John Berger would make of flat-earthers, climate change denialists, and other conspiracy theorist advocates. Are they the noble anti-establishment avant garde? I tried to find anything in this book that would speak to our unsettled times. I found brilliant insights but nothing that spoke to my own sense of unease specifically. For that reason, perhaps I enjoyed the picture essays the best this time around. Those chapters where the art and pictures were left without text to speak through me and let my anxieties and thoughts have free reign."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Here are some reductive summaries of the seven chapters in this book. Chapter 1: Art galleries are dumb, memes are the future. Chapter 2: Tits! Chapter 3: Men like looking at women, and pretending women are to blame for it. Chapter 4: Uh, art? I really don't know, there were runs of themes but nothing across everything. Chapter 5: Turns out they were all oil paintings. Apparently oil paintings are about owning things, where 'things' can be anything. Chapter 6: Different kinds of people. And horses. And dogs. No idea. Chapter 7: Adverts are a bit like oil paintings because they're about stuff. Okay, it might be apparent that I didn't really like this. Part of this is down to Berger's style, which seems to involve making weird and unsubstantiated claims, and then expanding airily on those claims. There are a bunch of points Berger does this in the text, but they are particularly galling when he does it with regard to the illustrations. Some examples: 1. : Berger instructs that we 'judge for yourself' about whether Hals painted some criticism of the Governesses. Well, I did, and I can't see anything to suggest that, and neither do I come away thinking that I 'know the personality traits and even habits' of the subjects, as both he and the author he quotes suggest I should. 2. : Berger says the two women have similar expressions. No, the one looks sleepy or perhaps embarrassed and the other flirtatious. 3. : Berger says that 'every square inch' of the painting appeals to the sense of touch. It doesn't. I couldn't even tell that anything was meant to be metal until I read Berger's description. My first impression was that the two subjects look staggeringly similar, and the distorted skull is weird and looks like a rendering issue. 4. : Berger says that the landowners' 'proprietary attitude towards what surrounds them' is evident in their stance and expressions. I can't see anything of the sort, they just look sort of squinty. Maybe I'm just not good at the sort of interpretation Berger likes to imagine for art. I certainly didn't get any sense of narrative in the three purely visual chapters, and struggled to even see any kind of point in any of the portfolios. My issues with Berger are larger than simply not being able to see what he sees in art, though. The title of the book is 'Ways of Seeing', and it is hard for me to escape the impression that what this refers to more than anything is the ability of art critics to see their own politics in art, regardless of anything actually visible in the piece itself. This is demonstrated by his own example. Aside from the first chapter, which presented the most convincing thesis (about shifts in the value of art), his textual chapters read like a 70's liberal hit list: he sees as important about art the objectification of women, 'possessions', and capitalism. There is no mention of realism/fabulism or anything important in different schools of art, and throughout it all he adopts a critical tone about the hegemony of European art -- despite including very few and primitive examples from any other source. I thought with the nudes he had a glimmer of a point -- the women are being objectified, and sometimes they are even being contorted so that they can be nude to the viewer. But this is almost a foundational premise of that whole class of art, and it's hardly shocking to learn that pictures of naked ladies are mostly for the pleasure of men. And, you know, for all that Berger lectures about issues with the nude, he sure seems to include a lot of them in his book. And I don't just mean in the chapters discussing nudes. Every single chapter has multiple nudes in it, though they are rarely central to anything he discusses. I wonder whether Berger himself considers his reader to be male? Regarding oil paintings and ownership, his argument seems highly contorted and bizarre, and he seems to stretch very hard to bring in snippets like ""if a man stole a potato he risked a public whipping"" which reinforce his narrative of wealth and possession and oppression without actually having anything to do with any art. Why is it that oil paintings in particular are about 'owning' the pictured thing, when that 'thing' can be anything from a landscape to people to a story to an ideal? After reading Berger, I still don't know why he thinks this, and really I grow more suspicious that he just wanted to make some appropriately Marxist noises. His analysis of advertising is less objectionable -- who doesn't find adverts annoying? -- but seems somewhat unstable when balanced on top of his wobbly oil painting thesis. He makes a series of assertions about what advertising images are, but again fails to substantiate most of these. I think the idea, really, is that you have to enter the book either 1) already agreeing with John Berger about everything, possibly because you're a liberal university student in the '70s or 2) willing to let John Berger just make sweeping statements which you will accept. The ideas in the first chapter are the most interesting, and I think the most well-argued of them all. No doubt the rest is useful as a possible perspective for thinking about art, but there is no real information being communicated here that isn't already communicated by the politics of half a century ago."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Berger opens this book with the claim that it is going to mostly be an edifying attempt to open a dialogue about vision and art, or at least incite the reader to start thinking for him or herself; it becomes clear pretty quickly that he is of the opinion that all thought converges rapidly & ultimately on the chronic terms, concepts and fixations of academic Marxism. Hastily and speciously reiterating Benjamin (and Heidegger, as these types like to pretend they haven't read), he gives a brief rundown on the way desire and attitude shape vision, notably leading to unfair and usually pornographic depictions of women for ""the male gaze"" (a phrase which Berger coined) ... he then drops the pretension of discussing art and spends the rest of the book explaining the evils of property ownership and, in a sub-McLuhanian waxing, advertising. The common motif in this book is the employment of kitsch, and the banal treatments of subject matters innate thereto, as the principle artwork discussed, such that the reader unacquainted with art will come away thinking that fewer than ten painters of intellectual interest every lived -- and, when occasionally deciding to note their existence, Berger claims that all artists who intelligently arranged their works did so solely as an explicit objection to capitalism. This book, then, is not so much an invitation to thought as an active and seemingly deliberate attempt to instill in its reader a sort of gnostic paranoia, that all reality ultimately reduces to 'rich man bad', and that all art, emotion, and endeavour are ultimately mere functions of this noumenal truth. Indeed, its overwhelming popularity seems to have had the intended effect, being one of many precursors to the current ""post-leftist"" epoch which presumes the same compulsive fixation on these Marxist concepts (which even they agree are untenable and nonsensical, but which it is apparently impossible to stop repeating). It's crazy to me that drivel like this is so popular, and serves as the introduction for so many to the visual arts as a subject ... although this, indeed, explains much more about so many things that strike me as crazy in the world of letters. One could blame Berger's country of birth for such intellectual disingenuity, but he was also a failed painter: there appears to be some precedent for a link between that and maliciously ignorant political mental complexes."

The world of art as we know it is consumed by us everyday and is both a reflection of the past and contains a mysterious cultural lens that helps us navigate through different mediums of art. By putting forward a perspective of oil-paintings, nude as a theme in art in light of feminism and publicity as the last dying breath of these art cultures, it invites you to sit and think about capitalism, democracy and what being free truly means and whether the world today has truly achieved that or just pretends it has. We’re often taught to love art and let ourselves be blown away by the interpretations of what it represents, the life it glorifies, the past it mystifies with the promise of gaining knowledge and becoming more cultured. But seldom are we driven to actually stop and think about whether the way we’re viewing art is indeed accurate or in line with the past in which it was birthed and the market through which it survived. For anyone who loves art, history and economy, this short book puts forward an interesting critique of art and society.

I wrote out some of my thoughts and then came across some of the same ideas in this insightful beautiful booklet. Perhaps this is why I feel so strongly towards the first of the essays. Nevertheless, I try here to capture the essence of it, in some quotes that I deem crucial: I: • An image became a record of how X had seen Y. • The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe • If we accept that we can see that hill over there, we propose that from that hill we can be seen. The reciprocal nature of vision is more fundamental than that of spoken dialogue. And often dialogue is an attempt to verbalize this – an attempt to explain how, either metaphorically or literally, ‘you see things’, and an attempt to discover how ‘he sees things'. • An image is a sight which has been recreated or reproduced. It is an appearance, or a set of appearances, which has been detached from the place and time in which it first made its appearance and preserved – for a few moments or a few centuries. Every image embodies a way of seeing. • Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing. • In the end, the art of the past is being mystified because a privileged minority is striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify the role of the ruling classes, and such a justification can no longer make sense in modern terms. And so, inevitably, it mystifies. • Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw it before. We actually perceive it in a different way. • The art of the past no longer exists as it once did. Its authority is lost. In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose III: • [A woman’s] nakedness is not, however, an expression of her own feelings; it is a sign of her submission to the owner’s feelings or demands. • Almost all post-Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal – either literally or metaphorically – because the sexual protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. • Here and in the European tradition generally, the convention of not painting the hair on a woman’s body helps towards the same end. Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion. The woman’s sexual passion needs to be minimized so that the spectator may feel that he has the monopoly of such passion • It is worth noticing that in other non-European traditions – in Indian art, Persian art, African art, Pre-Columbian art – nakedness is never supine in this way. And if, in these traditions, the theme of a work is sexual attraction, it is likely to show active sexual love as between two people, the woman as active as the man, the actions of each absorbing the other. V: • “What distinguishes oil painting from any other form of painting is its special ability to render the tangibility, the texture, the lustre, the solidity of what it depicts. It defines the real as that which you can put your hands on. Although its painted images are two-dimensional, its potential of illusionism is far greater than that of sculpture, for it can suggest objects possessing colour, texture and temperature, filling a space and, by implication, filling the entire world.” • “Oil paintings often depict things. Things which in reality are buyable. To have a thing painted and put on a canvas is not unlike buying it and putting it in your house. If you buy a painting you buy also the look of the thing it represents.” • “The art of any period tends to serve the ideological interests of the ruling class” • “Such a painting is a demonstration of more than the virtuosity of the artist. It confirms the owner’s wealth and habitual style of living” • “Works of art in earlier traditions celebrated wealth. But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth – which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in its tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” • “Each time a painter realized that he was dissatisfied with the limited role of painting as a celebration of material property and of the status that accompanied it, he inevitably found himself struggling with the very language of his own art as understood by the tradition of his calling.”"

I wish I had years ago. Although the examples from its 1970s origin are dated, its thesis is perhaps even more valid today than then: Oil painting emerged just as the Western world entered the era of capitalism and imperialism. The technique of perspective makes the viewer the center of all he (yes, Virginia, ""he"") sees, just as ""Western man"" viewed the resources of the world. Oil paintings, therefore, became a vehicle by which Western man could enjoy, in rich realistic detail, what he owned. Since the beginning of the 20th century, art has lost this patron-satisfying confidence, but its bastard child, advertising, has perverted the view even more by presenting, not what is already owned, but what we should desire to own, thus serving the needs of capitalism even further. Yes, a few cobwebs of Marxism hang about the theory, but it provides a thought-provoking analysis of the convergence of artistic technique and social context."

Berger successfully explains how what we see is influenced by what we believe and know. Reading images feels intuitive to us, since it's the most immediate way of communicating. As Berger points out in the opening sequence: There's one essay which talks about the difference between the and and thematises what would later be termed the male gaze and how those traditional Western oil paintings were a way of showing possession, wealth and status. Those beautiful hairless female bodies were rarely (if ever) about the women themselves, but about what their existence meant for the spectator / owner. In his last essay he handles the issue of why advertisement is so absurd and yet so effective. As he points out, what people are trying to sell us is the future – a future in which we can be envied and desired. It's a depressing thought, but sadly doesn't feel altogether wrong: but the points made were all interesting to consider.

It offers a multi-pronged approach towards understanding how images and meaning are conjoined and how our historic development from art as a religious utility to art as advertisement/propaganda has only served to confuse us further. In some sense, we are inundated with images but we are not literate of their effect on us. This book seeks to compel us to not confuse the pleasures of seeing with their sly deceptions. While much of the past art (images) has been examined and studied our current relationship with art, with images, has not been. Instead, we are made to believe what is shown to us, as the narrow definitions of success and motive are foised to our awareness without much critical awareness as to how else to understand what is being proposed. Instead, we are made to focus attention on very narrow parameters often to the detriment of our extended possibilities. We do not realize what we are doing, we are made to realize what we should do; instead of why. Our interests are made in alignment with the interests of those producing the images. In some sense this is an incomplete book. It's a brave stab at what is going on, but it begs another, fuller look as to the relationship behind images, in part, because there is no critical framework. Choosing the right framework would further us greatly but as there is relatively no framework for assessing the multivalence of images, this book does not need one to do what it is doing."

A few of the essays are verbal; the others are visual (A collection of images. What do you see when you watch them?).

One essay, the third one, is about the role of men and women in art. Obviously a very delicate matter nowadays. No one would claim now that ‘men act and women appear’ (Page 47) because of the changing role of gender and because of new technical developments: Aren’t we all occupied with how we appear, since we started using Facebook and Instagram? I would have loved to know what John Berger and his team would have thought about that!

It has profound insights into sickness and emptiness of modern society. Berger reminds us to be conscious about what you are looking at and experiencing; He criticizes traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. ‘Ways of Seeing’ was originally a 1972 BBC TV series, which rapidly became regarded as one of the most influential art programs ever made. At the very start of the first episode, John Berger takes a scalpel to ; the blade’s rough abrasion on canvas. The painting Berger cut was a facsimile, but the metaphor of the scalpel is plain: to question is to dissect. It is to cut past the scrim of beauty, and reveal more fundamental anatomies: capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, mimetic desire, and so on. This opening of Ways of Seeing presents a filmic reenactment of the argument of Walter Benjamin’s essay ; which he wrote during the terrifying onrush of fascism. He saw the crisis of European liberalism as, in part, a result of the emergence of new media, like photography and phonograph. Other machines of replication, along with these, had produced a more disturbing change in social consciousness. He was also interested in the entire network of mass mediation and the new, seemingly unanchored art form of film. He believed a broader shift is happening leading to nothing less than ‘the shattering of tradition’ and the ‘liquidation of the value of tradition in the cultural heritage’. As new forms of technological culture replaced the old, civilization moved into a halfway house of mediation, susceptible to new modes of political adventurism and mass behaviour. Too bad, it only had four episodes. Carl Sagan’s amazing television series ‘Cosmos’ too had just 12 parts. Meanwhile, ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ has 250+ episodes. As I said, it talks about sickness and emptiness of modern society… Five star for the series. Part (, , , )"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The 1970s and 1980s saw significant shifts in the ways we thought about art history, alongside its attempts to engage popular audiences. There were BBC TV shows in the 1970s that took art history outside the academy – for the traditionalist view there was Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation and others which espoused a conventional academic art historical view. Whereas Clark’s is seen as one of those shows that had lasting power and gravitas (which it did) the show that had the impact was John Berger’s in 1972. This is the book of that show. Unlike most books of art history, this is not a large format, lavishly illustrated in colour, glossy papered text, but a small paperback (glossy paper but with small black and white illustrations) and written in an accessible, engaging, pedagogic and didactic style that demands we think, rise to the challenge and answer the questions put to us. In this sense, Berger was part of the change in art history that saw the emergence of scholars such as Janet Wolff, Marcia Pointon, Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others who demanded that we understand art and art history as a social product, as a system of power and ideology with the result that pictures were not just pictures but social, cultural and political texts. In his version of this approach, Berger argues that the emergence of the canon of art as we know it and see it in the oil painting is linked to the emergence of capitalism and its peculiar deployment of power. He (and his unnamed co-authors – in the preface he says there are five authors) does this through seven essays, four written and three visual, exploring perspective and power (western art’s deployment of perspective places the viewer at the centre of the picture and valorises them, the nude, oil painting and advertising (which he calls publicity) while the visual essays argue for recognition of the place of high art in the popular present, for an understanding of power and dominance in the canon and claims to possession. When this book was published in 1972 this was a radical new way to think about old pictures on stuffy museum walls, and when I first read it in the early 1980s it remained provocative and challenging. It was with a sense of intrigue then that I came back to it 40 years after publication to consider whether it would be something I should set my students to read in an attempt to get them thinking differently about advertising. Although many of the ideas have become more mainstream, and although some of the writing has dated (for instance, it is gendered in ways we’d challenge now) the case retains its power and its pedagogic potential. It is humbling to find such a popularly accessible book that is both 40 years old and as powerful and important at is was when it first appeared. On its own terms it works, and we should not under-estimate its impact – but it will be intriguing to see what my students make of it. I am delighted to have revisited it."

Update on 17 March: 3.5 out of 5 I first read this book on a 7-hour bus ride from Paris to Maastricht. I could feel a strong, burning gaze projecting from my left side the whole time. When the owner of that gaze, the Dutch girl that sat beside me, could no longer hold it in and asked me what was it about the book that made me seem so immersed in it, I really wanted point to the intangible conversation that started travelling between us and say, "", is exactly why."" I wasn't really reading. There was no way that one could absorb Berger throughout all that bumpiness. I merely acted like I was focused so that I didn't have to socialize. Other than my inability to enjoy normal socialization, I also couldn't quite aptly explain to her what's so mesmerizing about the book. Therefore, after 2 years, now that I'm working in an art organisation, I feel the urgent need to re-read this book. And there are only two things: 1. John Berger might be explaining things that you already know but just sit tight and sit through it because he'll explain it like you've never heard it before. The way he writes is sheer . 2. There's no better way of explaining Berger than by directly quoting him, for examples see below: The above is only the tip of the iceberg. As much as it fills my heart with wholesomeness as a pleasant read should, I believe this book is just what we all cite to make something that we wrote, which despite already making enough sense on its own, sounds better."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Ways of Seeing peels off the layers of difference between ""seeing"" and ""looking"" as it pertains to our perception of visual works of art. While looking is a natural phenomenon that happens through the interactions of our retinas with the outside world, seeing assumes an understanding, a context, a subject. Seeing, is an art in itself. Berger might just be one of the first people who situates ""seeing"" in this complicated setting for a wide audience. In the seven chapters of this book, Berger uncovers the social and political context of art as it has evolved through the last couple of centuries, drawing fascinating conclusions regarding the monetary value of art, its relation to our dreams, desires, bodies and class. I suspect some parts of this book, depending on the chapter and corresponding essays, are not particularly revolutionary to readers who are already familiar with said essays. For example, anyone who has read the renowned by Walter Bejamin, will not find the corresponding chapter in striking. But for others, Berger provides a thought-provoking and sensitive route. This is a wonderful book. The prose is both uncomplicated and compelling, beckoning the reader to keep reading. Berger has a gentle but keen style of writing and a sincere passion for art that radiates in-between the lines. There is a kindness, a caring, in his sensibility that I felt again and again as I read through, and yet, I can't fully describe what I mean by this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to understand what it means to ""see"" art, and I also recommend that you take advantage of the wonderful (perhaps also melancholic; read the book to understand what I mean by this) digital accessibility of the mentioned paintings and photographs to view them in a better quality while Berger discusses them."

Revisited for a reference and ended up rereading it . As fascinating as it is pioneering ( considering it was written in 1972, way back in capitalism's childhood, well before it grew up and cast it's powerful grip around the idea of human life). Berger and co essentially chart the history of visual imagery in art, from the era of oil painting to television, slowly peeling out layer after layer teasing out the implicit messages and societal subtexts hidden within the images, and quite remarkably without preaching a communist manifesto! Berger is still alive and kicking, I would be really curious to know his views on modern-age consumerism as a culture. It would be just wonderful if he takes time out to write a sequel - possibly commenting on the new era capitalism - from designer handbags to high definition televisions, perhaps not on the idea of compulsive consumerism as such ( which has been already covered here) but more on the consumers themselves as a cohort. The need for the consumerism and perhaps suggestions about alternatives?"

It's something that I think about very often when exploring our world and all of its stories and pictures: why is it like this, who does it serve, what do we see and what do we actually see and what is the undertone and so forth. In a way I got muuuuuch more from ""Sinut on nähty"" by Anu Silfverberg than by this but then again this did exist a long time before that so I'm not putting them against each other but saying that they complimented each other in terms of the gaze. Maybe I'm just thinking about it because the part about the way women were painted had an impact on me and was way bigger than its length.

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The novelist and artist John Berger published Ways of Seeing as a supplement to a BBC documentary series about art history in 1972. It is a slim volume. Its ideas are weak, unoriginal, and poorly reasoned. It Is certainly a good book to ignore. Not one single chapter carries much intellectual weight. A prime example of Berger’s weak reasoning is in the section on the portrayal of nude women in art. Berger’s claim is that women in Renaissance paintings appear without clothing for the purpose of being enjoyed by aristocratic male viewers. As if that needed to be explained. The owner of each painting, presumably a male though it is hard to imagine that no women ever saw this stuff, owns the nude woman depicted the same way he owns property. Her nudity symbolizes his dominance and superiority over her. Her missing pubic hair symbolizes her lack of will in making sexual choices. While these claims may be true, Berger does not offer any explanation as to why we should accept his interpretation. John Berger says it is true so we must accept it as truth, case closed. By logical extension, this is like saying you own Jimi Hendrix’s corpse because you bought one of his records. Owning a painting of a woman is not equivalent to owning a woman. The painters hired women to model for them which entails the reality that those women could accept or reject the offer of hiring themselves out as models; this means they made choices. The painters themselves did not keep women chained up in dungeons. And Berger never takes up the idea that those women may actually have wanted and chosen to be portrayed in such ways. He does not cite one instance of a Renaissance woman saying anything whatsoever about her role as a painter’s model. So where does Berger get this idea from? He never tells. He also never cites any examples of what that time’s painters or aristocratic art patrons thought about these depictions of nude women either. Yet Berger claims to know exactly what they thought. Even worse, he writes as if all upper-class European men thought identical thoughts about women and he writes as though all women have identical thoughts about how women in paintings are portrayed. Common sense would tell you that opinions vary from person to person so overgeneralizing about whole populations of people who died long before he was born is absurd. Even if we accept his claim, which does appear to be plausible, why should be so concerned anyways? If the images are symbolic depictions, we do not have to automatically accept the content of the symbol as being legitimate. Each person can agree or disagree with the merits of what is symbolized as they choose. The ability and intent of the viewer to choose interpretations is never addressed either. John Berger’s stance as a male art critic in this matter is questionable too. He interprets these paintings on behalf of women without acknowledging whether or not he even consulted with women on the matter. How does he claim to be a representative and spokesperson for women? Isn’t he denying women a voice in this issue by claiming to be the arbiter of correct interpretations on their behalf? Isn’t that a form of male domination that he would otherwise decry? After all, he complains about women not having their own voice in Renaissance art so doesn’t this make him guilty of the same crime? The chapter on oil painting is no better. Rich Europeans buy paintings of objects because owning paintings of objects is the same as owning, or at least desiring to own, the object itself. Buying and owning a painting of a farm is the same as owning a farm. But how does ho know this? Research into how art owners of the time thought about ownership and art is nonexistent in Berger’s monologue. Why is this even raised as a problem? Are we supposed to accept at face value that purchasing and owning property is inherently wrong? Berger was a communist sympathizer so his answer would be “yes, owning property is inherently wrong”. But why should this idea be accepted? Just because he says so? If property is so terrible than why did John Berger sell his own paintings? Why did he have his books published by large corporate publishing firms to be sold as objects in a capitalist marketplace? Why did he choose to live in England instead of moving to the Soviet Union which was still communist in the 1970s? In the USSR, he would not have had the freedom to paint what he wanted to and he would not be allowed to publish books that criticize the political or economic system so maybe John Berger was being just a little bit of a hypocrite by hating the system he depended on for his own intellectual freedom. The final chapter is about the direct connection between oil painting and advertising. He does provide some insight into the psychology of advertising which makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and incomplete. Advertising provokes the consumer to desire products that make them feel part of an elite, like the Renaissance era aristocracy who owned the most property. No doubt, that appears to be more or less true. But again, so what? Why is it wrong to want to buy things? There do not appear to be many people in the world who do not want to have any possessions at all. But John Berger never examines the other side of the argument. His accusatory tone is manipulative and authoritarian; he wants to lay a heavy guilt trip on his audience and in the end, guilt trips are all about controlling people. Just read what Nietzsche and Foucault had to say about the Christian church’s use of guilt as a method of coercion and domination. Ways of Seeing presents us with sparsely worded text with weak reasoning and tiny black and white pictures meant to exemplify what he says. The claims lack intellectual rigor and the pictures are so difficult to see that this whole book comes off as a poorly executed work of juvenile nonsense. It is best to pass this one over. Its proper place is in the recycling bin."

I thoroughly enjoyed the perspectives on women as objects in art, on oil paintings as a product and/or catalyst of capitalism, and on publicity (my Guy Debord read earlier this year came in handy here). My only point of criticism, and one I know has to do with the time this was written and published, is the air of finality with which the authors speak about the gender binary and the (mental) cages women are put/put themselves in. This would probably have been worded differently in a re-worked edition and maybe even extended to other genders and sexualities. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in art, sociology, or critique of capitalism."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"By and large, I'm not a fan of manifestos. This one was no exception. It had a lot of insight, as manifestos often do, and I learned a lot from it, which is also not atypical. But to my mind, there's something insulting about a manifesto. To borrow a metaphor from Eudora Welty, writing like this is the equivalent of serving me my brain food already cut up for me. The ideas may be deeper than a trashy romance novel (for example), but the level of respect for the audience is roughly the same. And I always tend, right or wrong, to begin judging the ideology in question through the lens of that disrespect. If they have this much distrust for people in general, then how can their ideas about life not be tainted with that fundamental distrust? Since I do not share that distrust, how much am I really going to accept the ideas they've built on it? All of that is the case, as I said, with manifestos in general. So what about this particular one? the book, is apparently based on a BBC series of the same name and with the same purpose. Their purpose is to get us to look at art in a different way (namely, and being a leftist myself I don't throw this term around lightly: in a Marxist way). They begin with a very simplistic explanation of the importance of sight (based, apparently, on the fact that we are able to see before we are able to do just about anything else—never mind that we actually start using all four of our other senses before we even open our eyes), and then go on to the importance of visual art: painting, photography, that kind of thing. Then they leap straight into the Marxism and attempt to show the ways in which art, especially painting, has always been used to promote capitalism (even, it seems, before there was capitalism) and to celebrate the virtue of the propertied class. Some of which is interesting, actually, but some of which is stretching quite a bit. In true manifesto fashion, they make sure to consistently point out the ways in which seeming exceptions actually prove the rule. Also in true manifesto fashion, they are careful to pick the most egregious examples they can find in order to make their points without looking like they picked the most egregious examples available. I have to include one quote, because I think it's so emblematic. Or, to put it another way: ""We're rubber, you're glue. Bounces off us and sticks to you."" They're right about the nature of obsession, I'm sure, but that isn't much of a defence since their own argument could be described with that sentence. Here's the thing, though. There's a lot of value in the book. I actually do have a new way of seeing art now, and I think it's a better informed way. I also have a more complex understanding of some other issues, ranging from the nature of masculinity to the nature of history to the nature of envy and beyond. All of which is good, and all of which is despite the fact that this isn't my first exposure to many of these ideas. I got this book on a recommendation from a prof in grad school, and in his class and others I did think about & discuss many of these ideas. But the value of a manifesto, I suppose, is that (since they almost completely disregard opposing viewpoints) they can really succinctly get deep into the ideas at hand. So there is a lot to be gained from a book like this. Even if I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. P.S. I must say something about the design of this book. It's horrible. Really, absolutely terrible. Take a closer look at that cover image (click on it and look at the large version). The text on there is actually the beginning of the book. It's repeated again inside, but I guess they thought they'd look more serious and utilitarian if they just started right in with the cover? This book also suffers from the same ridiculous modernist notion (later completely disavowed by Jan Tschichold, who started it) that sans-serif fonts are better than serif fonts because they are free of the ""adornment"" of serifs. They take it one step further here, and use a bold sans-serif throughout the book. Which is just dumb. Many of their other design choices (full one-inch paragraph indentations, for example) are equally dumb, and the book looks like it was thrown together in half an hour by a high-school journalism class. Really, it's just atrocious. P.P.S. The book ends, and I'm not kidding, with a page that has one line on it: The absolute pretension at work here was almost more than I had the stomach for."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing” was one of the books I had to read. When the slim volume arrived, it was a bit of an anticlimax: the writing was in bold letters, the photographs of paintings were in black and white, lots of them. Apparently, it sprang out of a series of Television programmes shown in 1972. It is worth watching the series on You Tube, and certainly more rewarding. He is, I think, the precursor of the excellent television art historians and critics we see today, who all, in their individual ways, present works of art with a fresh and original eye. By that very fact, his successors have overtaken him. There is a certain aridity in Berger’s approach in the book; he is following a thesis and aligning what he sees to conform to his thesis. He is very good at analysing the paintings, of making us aware of how certain aspects of life and the information we glean influence the way we view them. He goes into the fundamentals of what it means to see a work of art or a painting. His strength lies in delving into the philosophical and social aspects which link paintings with our emotions and lives. “Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognises before he can speak.” “It is seeing that establishes our place in the surrounding world. ...We explain that world with words.” The relationship between what we see and what we know is never settled. He gives an example, ""The Key of Dreams"" by Magritte, which shows the gap between words and seeing. Our knowledge of certain fundamental facts does not somehow fit what we see, as in the setting of the sun. I had not consciously thought of why the dislocation between image and word in Magritte’s paintings speaks to me, and why we do not dismiss his work as that of a lunatic. The other interesting observation is that in art, perspective became all important – in other words, the viewer or the creator were the main characters. Then came the camera, liberating image from time and space. Paintings, he argues, were a capitalist concept. They adorned the houses of the rich, they showed the opulence of their interiors and the objects that surrounded them, the clothes they wore and their estates. When it became possible to reproduce paintings, the philosophical question of what painting was in itself could be posed. There is a picture of a Van Gogh painting of a cornfield with birds. We are invited to look at it and then turn the page and see it with this explanation: “this is the last picture that Van Gogh painted before he killed himself.” Notice how the knowledge the words convey influence the way we see the painting. I am reminded of how the life of a writer sometimes colours the way we view their book, which is why I often like to come to the novel without knowing anything about the author. In the section on The Nude, he describes how Woman is depicted. There are many illustrations. Woman thinks of how she appears to others and ultimately how she appears to men. She is aware of the spectator. She is sometimes shown with a mirror, a symbol of vanity. In non-European art (Indian, Persian, preColumbian) nakedess is not supine. There is mutual attraction between the sexes. Berger makes a clear distinction between what it means to be naked, to be without clothes, and what it is to be nude, which is to be a mere object of display. Nowadays, this resonates even more strongly. Section 5 is on objects in paintings. The last section is on publicity. Posters and publicity material are juxtaposed with paintings, needing almost no commentary. “the oil painting was addressed to those who make money out of the market. Publicity is addressed to those who constitute the market.” “All publicity”, he writes, “works upon anxiety. The sum of everything is money, to get money is to overcome anxiety. Alternatively the anxiety on which publicity plays is the fear that having nothing you will be nothing.” Try as we might, it is an environent we cannot escape."

A phrase the author must've mentioned about twice is: ""someone should research this"", and he's right, because I want to know more about it. There are four actual essays with text in them. I didn't really get the first one, however, it was based on a little text by Walter Benjamin called ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"", which I, completely coincidentally, bought alongside this book, because I wanted to read something about art, these next couple of days, so I suppose I'll read that one tomorrow. The second one was about the way women are represented in paintings - that is: different from men, they become objects often sexualized as well, creating this weird way women look at themselves as being perceived by others and themselves as well, very interesting. The third essay was about oil paintings. It was good. Good things, how it was heavily influenced by things like social status, certain paintings representing things which remind the people who own the paintings of their wealth. You know, I was in a museum, a couple of months ago, and there were a lot of paintings of exorbitant amounts of food. I never really got why they were made, until now, thanks to this book. Berger really just showed you always have to see a painting in all of the context in which it was made, really great stuff and will probably change the way I'll look at certain paintings in the future. His last essay (maybe my favorite one, I don't know, they were all great) touched on the loose connection between oil paintings and publicity, but really it just seemed like an excuse to talk a bit about publicity and consumerism, which I actually didn't mind at all, even though the world of advertising has evolved so much some of it doesn't really translate to today that well. All in all, I really liked it, I can only recommend this, to be honest and I think I'll certainly take a look at the series this was based on. That's it. Read this book, alright. Have a good rest of your day!"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars for this. Ways of Seeing by John Berger is a book about art and art criticism. It's made of seven essays, each treating different topics related to perception and image through art, where Berger explores the various layers of the visual world that is such a great and unavoidable part of our daily lives. He does that by using images and words, without dragging and staying on the same idea for too long, which makes the book really fast and easy to read. What I liked about was some specific essays, and how Berger treated some of the topics. He has a remarkable way of analysing complex subjects that go centuries back in very few words, which was impressive and very welcomed. An essay where I found myself agreeing with every word was essay 3, where Berger talks about the depiction of women in European art through the centuries, and more specifically the depiction of nude women. It was a mix of art, psychology and philosophy, more so than the other essays, and it showed the striking but absolutely not surprising or new chasm between the image of men and women in society, and so, inevitably, in art. What I didn't like about was, well, also some specific essays. There were some essays, such as the last one, that made me skim or sleep or fall asleep while skimming. Because of the way this book is formed, I know I would be asking for too much if I expected to like all of the seven subjects treated. The last essay, for example, was all about publicity, which could have been interesting -and I'm sure it was for some people-, if it didn't analyse such superficial concepts. I didn't feel like it was teaching me anything, because yes, we all know that images in publicity are meant to pass messages like ""if you buy this you become desirable, if you can't buy it you're not desirable"". In other words, I know this book is always recommended to people who are into art, and since it's short and easy to read you don't have anything to lose by reading it; I'd mostly recommend it to people who are into visual studies in general, though, as they might benefit more from reading it."

Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless. He lives in the contradiction between what he is and what he would like to be. Either he then becomes so fully conscious of the contradiction and its causes, and so joins the political struggle for a full democracy which entails, amongst other things, the overthrow of capitalism; or else he lives, continually subject to an envy which, compounded with his sense of powerlessness, dissolves into recurrent day-dreams"""

But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in it tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” 7-“the spectator-buyer is meant to envy herself as she will become if she buys the product. She is meant to imagine herself transformed by the product into an object of envy for others, an envy which will then justify her loving herself.

At the time of publication this was a revolutionary book and proposed a whole new way of looking at paintings. I still find it a refreshing analysis but it is, as to be expected, in urgent need of an update. I would love to hear Berger discuss ways of seeing now and whether his position has changed in any way. The Marxist analysis dates the book but I think Berger is still committed to this understanding and firmly believe that class is an important distinction in understanding society and us as individuals. Certainly in the UK. It is naïve to believe that how we perceive images does not depend upon our own way of seeing, yet the way we are encouraged to look at art is affected by a range of assumptions. This can create a number of contradictions within the viewer. I also like the way he addresses gender and issues of sexuality. Equally, his discussion around art and advertising raises a number of interesting issues. This is a short and relatively easy read"

Berger synthesizes ideas from Walter Benjamin, Levi-Strauss, and other thinkers succinctly and to great effect. He powers through the obfuscatory bullshit of art historians to get to meaty ideas about power and wealth, though I will warn you about a leftward slant. Personally, I'm in complete agreement with him, but if you are in a different political camp, or if you subscribe to the aforementioned obfuscatory bullshit, this book will probably have you sputtering with indignation. Sputter away, friends. Although it was written in the 70's, I found most of it still very relevant, especially (and sadly) the essay on women. Only the last essay on advertising felt dated: not that it wasn't still true, only to a greater degree. I'd love to see the television shows on which the essays are based."

With many such transcendent statements like the above, no wonder this book is so successful. Ok I’m being facetious. Partway through the first chapter John Berger admits he’s just paraphrasing Baudrillard. Then he goes on to summarise Laura Mulvey’s scopophilia; and presumably someone else for the next chapters on ownership and the city. 50% of the book is images. Apparently Brits have an affinity for this as it was turned into a tv-show. I originally went to university for art theory so admittedly this all felt like watered down retreads of roads others have already paved.

Like every art history student in the late 70s, I first read it in an Introduction to Art History class. It is in itself a historical document; published before America's fascination with French theory really took hold, and it neatly and succinctly offers capsule overviews of Benjamin and Barthes as well as a good if somewhat dated analysis of the nude from a feminist viewpoint. When Berger wrote this book, he was very much the rebellious iconoclast (going so far as to suggest that traditional oil painting reified capitalist hegemony and even slavery), and his romance with Marxism and theory of desire now seem a little naive. Nevertheless, his work remains interesting for evoking a certain tenor of the times...and it's quite an easy read as far as theory goes."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Reflecting on my reading year 2016, I came to think of books that have meant a lot to me over the past decades, and the first one that came to my mind was Gombrich’s excellent introduction to art history. I will have to go back twenty years, half my life, to the year 1996. I am twenty years old, and just about to discover the pleasurable adventure called university. For Christmas, I receive a much longed-for gift card to buy books that “will help me in my studies”, and I stand in a bookstore, one of those exquisite, inexhaustible bookstores on several floors that German university cities provide, and I am browsing through options. I probably spend hours there. I can still feel the time pass, while I look, think, go through history, art, literature. I pick a book, then another one, and more still, until I have to bring one back. Gift card value is weighed against all these lovely, lovely possibilities. At this moment in time, I own one Billy bookshelf, and it is not filled yet, as my children’s books and classics are left at my parents’ house. What do I pick? I don’t remember the fiction, but I do remember picking a “start of the term offer”, Mayersches Taschenlexikon, in 34 volumes, rarely used, as the internet takes over soon, and it is inconvenient to look up definitions by going through entries in alphabetical order. Some time between 1996 and now, it falls victim to one of our many moves between cities and countries. I don’t have it anymore. I bought it out of duty. I choose one extravaganza: Gombrich. A German hardback copy, beautifully illustrated, taking a huge chunk of the gift card money. I start reading as soon as I come home. And almost magically, it opens up the world of art to me. I learn why Egyptians “walk like Egyptians”, I discover Rubens, Bernini, Raphael, Leonardo, and Delacroix,and Canova, Manet and Monet, and Picasso, Duchamp and, and, and... I discover the world through a visual prism. Ever since then, Gombrich has followed my path. I soon come to read his more specialised works on form, function and symbolism in Renaissance art, I learn about his life, deeply influenced by 20th century history, and I keep going back to “The Story Of Art” whenever I need to take a step back and look at general ideas again. And I steal my mother’s Swedish copy! I want to read it aloud to my children, and they are only used to their father reading in German, and me in Swedish. So in order not to confuse them more than necessary in their Babylonian curse, I read it in Swedish, the stolen goods. And what a help that has been in the many museums around the world that my children have visited over the years. They recognise their “Gombrich” when they see it. Two years ago, my eldest son wants a copy - in English, in order to be able to quote from it. And of course I can’t resist buying it for him, at a shop inside the British Museum. So we have three copies, and I would not be beyond buying one in French, at a shop in the Louvre, maybe, just for the silliness of owning a favourite in so many different shapes. For they are all slightly different in layout, but equally satisfying visually and textually. I still recommend it to whoever wants a clear, concise, lovable account of the history starting with cave paintings in Lascaux, and moving forwards still, mirroring humanity in its need to express ideas, thoughts and feelings through the medium of art. My children and I will now be reading , which Gombrich wrote expressly for children, and YES - we read it in Swedish. And YES, we have it in English as well! And NO - one Billy bookshelf is not even enough for our children’s books anymore! This is The Story Of Lisa And The Story Of Art, to be continued..."

Gombrich covers all the major artists and the movements they represent, and ties them together with clarity. Like one of our most knowledgeable 'friends' on the art circuit at goodreads, he is discerning, but not judgmental. Indeed, Gombrich's account of the development of modern art - up until World War II -- is fabulous, though brief. Gombrich is much less upbeat on more recent trends -- he mentions Pop, but quite deliberately (it seems) refuses to even mention Warhol's name. I know that it's very difficult for people who know a great deal about something to recommend -- or even read - introductory books.

Gombrich is more than knowledgeable and yet manages to condense without condescending or reducing his narrative to trivial choices. He brings the freshness that comes with the enthusiasm of discovery. Of course, what he is sharing is not new to him, but sharing the works and his insights with the reader is new and exciting to him, and the enthusiasm is infectious. The intended audience is younger readers than myself, high school and college age readers or adults new to art history. But I found the book not just enjoyable but helpful and insightful.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I should preface everything I say with a general caveat: I am a novice in the world of art, which is the reason I picked up this book in the first place. Although I often drew as a child, I was more interested in schematic, technical drawings than anything you could call ‘art’. And, despite my keen appreciation of music and fiction, I’ve always had the visual equivalent of a ‘tin ear’. I could stand in front of a masterpiece and be more interested in what I just ate for lunch. So with that shameful admission out of the way, on to the review. In a book such as this, there are bound to be almost as many people disappointed as impressed. It’s the curse of the writer of survey books: to reduce the scope of the material down to the size of one volume, enormous omissions are inevitable. If sales alone are the to be the rubric, then Gombrich must be considered a tremendous success; nevertheless, many whose favorite paintings and sculptures were passed over without mention or comment will likely be irked. (It should also be said that his treatment of ‘primitive’ art is hopelessly uninformed and, despite his best efforts, condescending. Additionally, this book hardly touches on non-European art.) Due to my general ignorance, I was none too bothered by this. In fact, it was just what the doctor ordered. Gombrich sweeps the reader through Western history, allowing just enough time for some quick rubber-necking at the sites along the way. What you get is a brief who’s who, and the general lay of the land. Of course, anyone with an even moderate interest in art history will have to fill in the quite sizable gaps left by this method, but that’s to be expected. The only book somewhat similar to I've read is by Ian MacDonald—a song-by-song analysis and critique of the Beatles’s music. That book (highly recommended) is astounding because MacDonald’s ears are so frighteningly acute. Although I have musical training and have been listening to the Beatles since my youth, MacDonald makes you hear their music in new and exciting ways, opening up a whole new aural world. Gombrich does the same thing, but to a lesser extent, with the history of art. He has a keen eye; and, more impressive, he is able to render technical analysis into the plainest of plain prose. The reader’s mind is not burdened by the slew of art history terms that are thrown at undergraduates in introductory classes. Gombrich bypasses the linguistic apparatus and goes straight to what’s really important: the image on the canvass (or the form on the marble, etc.). So, to bring this already-too-long review to a close, read for a clear, concise, and engaging introduction to the world of visual art. It’s not one-stop shopping. But then, what book is?"

Of course, if you have some, this can make you seriously engage some of your previously held assumptions about what you like and why you like it, but I got the distinct impression while reading that it was meant to initiate a teenager – a teenager who very much reminded of me of myself – into a whole new world. The inclusions and exclusions of certain artists are, of course, always arbitrary. However, Gombrich’s choices do not deviate too much from a standard art history text. What particularly drew me to the book was what I perceived to be its inordinate focus on medieval and especially Renaissance art. Of the twenty-eight chapters included in the book, about five mostly focus on Western medieval images (6 and 8-11). Another six chapters (13-18) focus on the art of the Western Renaissance. Most surveys of art history to which I had been previously exposed paid scant attention to medieval art and they sometimes did not give the Renaissance the space that I felt it deserved. There is no doubt the medieval and Renaissance art Gombrich’s pet periods here (and, admittedly, they’re mine, too.) What makes it so special is that, instead of spending the first chapter in an abstract exercise of thinking about what “Art” is, he forces you over and over again to take the art on its own terms. While discussing the various visual perspectives painted by the artist of “The Garden of Nebamun,” he says: “To us reliefs and wall-paintings provide an extraordinarily vivid picture of life as it was lived in Egypt thousands of years ago. And yet, looking at them for the first time, one may find them rather bewildering. The reason is that the Egyptian painters had a very different way from ours of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the different purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artists’ task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to them from any fortuitous angle” (p. 60). It is the occasional insight like this that makes the book most worthwhile for a neophyte. After all, how many of us have measured something we saw by the standards of our particular narrow time and place? He really drives home the point that thinking about art seriously means thinking about other perspectives (both literally and figuratively), other preoccupations, and other aesthetic modus operandi. This is a lesson that should be lost on none of us, about art, or about anything else."

It is the o.g. primer on art history, so reading it gave me insight into the thought processes of some of my more old-school college professors. It also cleared up some of my shameful misconceptions around when certain artists were active (Titian 😳). The prose is very simple and engaging, and I looked forward to reading this book every day. However, I dread to imagine someone reading this in 2020 without a gargantuan grain of salt. Right off the bat, the book wildly speculates about the purposes of cave paintings (prehistoric people believed they were magic. obvs.). Any time it talks about non-Western art, the descriptions are pretty cringy. And female artists all but don't exist (I think the book names one). If there's a more contemporary art history book that is as thorough as this one, I'd love to hear about it."

I would like to be able to do the same thing with paintings. I would like to be able to look up a painting on my phone, and appreciate it anytime and anywhere. To most people, paintings are one dimensional, containing only what meets the eye. The reality of paintings is that they necessarily have enormous depth, ranging from the historical period during which they were created, what events lead to that point, the personal circumstances of the artist and the emotional and intellectual mental states of the artist during the act of painting. Paintings are snapshots of consciousness, and offer fertile ground for studying consciousness itself. I visited Rome and Florence in Italy in 2018 but failed to appreciate the grand artworks I saw there at the time. I hope I can appreciate these masterpieces more on my next visit. That being said, I did cry a little standing beneath David by Michelangelo. I didn't have the maturity to appreciate great art at the time, but David nevertheless evoked powerful emotions in me. In , Gombrich asserts that there are no wrong reasons for liking an art, but that there are wrong reasons for disliking an art.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This well-composed book was a pleasure to read. And as far as introducing the history of art, it is exactly what I was looking for; beautiful photographs, lucid descriptions, no jargon, no pretension. I recommend that you read the short preface and first chapter, and I bet that you won’t stop there. The book’s 600 pages contain at least as many photographs, mostly of paintings, and about half of those figures are full-page (including a few fold-outs [ooh la la:]). The text is written simply – without jargon, footnotes, endnotes or appeal to authority. Mr. Gombrich’s restraint is impressive, since he obviously has a deep knowledge and personal appreciation for the topic. Instead of appealing to authority, he draws upon the art itself and universal human instincts to help the reader understand the artist and the art. For example, he explains the ancient Egyptian belief that images carry the soul, not by objectifying their primitive beliefs, but by suggesting an exercise by which the reader can discover that those feelings are commonplace within herself. He provokes (p. 40): “Suppose we take a picture of our favourite champion from today’s paper – would we enjoy taking a needle and poking out the eyes? Would we feel as indifferent about it as if we poked a hole anywhere else in the paper? I do not think so.” And so begins the dynamic struggle of emotion and reason that we follow through the history of art. This book impresses as much by its layout and editing as by the text and pictures themselves. Each of the many chapters begins with an architectural example. Since the text wisely refrains from tangents into cultural history, the architecture serves a second purpose (besides exemplifying preserved art) of adding practical context to the timeline. Then, each chapter ends with a small picture showing an artist from that time period at work. These little pictures are the only ones not actually referred to in the text, and again add non-text context, while bringing the reader closer to the artists. This approach succeeds in impressing the reader with the most important concepts in art history, since they are the ones that naturally recur throughout the story. The author frequently refers the reader to previous pictures (always giving the page number). Since the text is so brief, the reader, upon looking back at a previous picture, will also be reminded of the ideas expressed on that earlier page. Again, the author amplifies this learning effect by using consistent language and choosing pieces of art that will compliment each other. This model only breaks down in the final two chapters, which were added to later additions, about our contemporary art. The author has some worthwhile ideas about this topic, but writes too much. We can guess why this happened, and it does not detract much from the rest of the book. Finally, the backmatter contains a well-organized bibliography and timeline. As you can tell, I recommend this book. Even if, unlike myself, you already have a good knowledge of art history, I predict that you will appreciate this book. You may just read it a little faster."

Gombrich I was attracted to this beautiful little book in Waterstones; its wafer thin, smooth bible pages, section of over 400 rich colour plates and stylish, minimal cover design. I was also feeling a pang of guilt for not shopping in bookshops anymore because Amazon is so easy and cheap. Walking through a bookstore, perusing books and judging them by there covers, is a real pleasure and one we will be denied access to as everybody shops online, I am pretty sure we will see high street bookshops closing down soon unless they can figure out a way to compete with Amazon. So I bought The Storey of Art mainly because it’s so attractive but I also have a staggering lack of knowledge about art history - this looked like a good way to fill myself in. I read a quote recently that said if you read one hundred books on a subject you can call yourself an expert, it’s a bit daft but I have decided set myself a challenge; read 100 art books. This one has taken me about three months to read so expertise feels like a distant dream. It took so long beacuse I wanted to concentrate and take it all in, this book covers the whole of art history from early cave painting to post-modernism, that’s a lot of useful information, also, it’s not just reading the words but taking the time to look carefully at each image and it’s not the sort of book you can read in the bath or in bed because you have to keep refering back to plates. Fortunatley it is extremely accesable, intriguiging and keenly observing making it very readable and a little pleasure to indulge in. Being so ignorant of the subject, I loved that it took its time over periods and themes, referring back to them in the following chapters, revisiting artists and styles and giving in depth critical background to works such as stylistic influences and pressures on artists of different times. It strikes a perfect balence of being informative and comprehensive without becoming stifling; it is an insightful and rich overview. I am certain that I will actually be able to remember some of this information, I couldn’t have hoped for more from art book #1/100. So maybe walking into bookshops and judging books by their covers is a good strategy after all."

I'm giving it 5 stars, because it narrates the history of art in an engaging, digestible, colourful, and conversational manner in a way that brings the subject matter to life for a wide audience. I was riveted, absorbed, inspired, and left with a thirst to go out into the world and learn even more about art. That doesn't mean that I believe this is a perfect book. It looks at art from a Eurocentric perspective, only discusses ONE female artist (zero in the First Edition), and retains some phrasing that will seem culturally insensitive to the modern ear. Still, this book gave me a whole new appreciation for art. Not ALL art, I hasten to add. I remain unmoved by a lot of what Modern Art has to offer, and there are only so many renditions of ""Madonna with Child"" that one can view in an afternoon before they all start to blur together. But art appreciation is certainly a skill that can be developed with increased knowledge of intent, context, purpose, and technique. Now to read The Story of Art without men..."

In my opinion, the book is fabulously readable for two reasons: Every piece of art mentioned is shown in the book beside the text and the author avoids ""pretentious jargon"". I wish every art book followed just these two principles. While the European art from the Thirteenth to Nineteenth Centuries (the bulk of the book) eventually became a slog which threatened to make my eyes glaze over, this is no fault of Gombrich. Instead, he has given me a much greater appreciation of this time period. The art is so much more interesting against a backdrop of history and biography. True to the title, the book really does read like a story. It's not just a series of mind-numbing names, place, and dates. It's a seamless narrative of art over time.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Story Of Art A good book to pair with this reading might be - Key Moments In Art, Lee Cheshire Gombrich surveys the history of art through the ages, incorporating the successive opinions, tastes, and works of art into one continuous story. His style of writing is easy and unassuming, assisted with many beautiful illustrations of paintings, sculptures, pottery, cave art, frescoes, and icons. From the ancient era to the modern era, Gombrich explains the current theories behind why and how early humans - hunters and gatherers - drew on the walls of the caves nearby their settlement, or crafted figurines and masks. The book is considered a seminal piece of work for any aspiring art student, and as such would serve as essential reading for anyone starting a journey in the realm of understanding works of art. As a starting point, Gombrich argues that our perception of art, and consequently our love for it, is often strangled by what we see from our own vision - haemorrhaged by our constant desire for all things realistic-looking. Rather, he argues, we should be asking of a piece, ""does it work?"" in the way the artist intended. He digs down on the ancient Egyptian era of art and investigates the hieroglyphs that proliferated the walls and tombs. What we at first may see as simple, two-dimensional and amateurish pictures, is really an indication of the artist's purpose. They saw hard-grafted stories and laws of their religion, alongside a set of beliefs, being followed. One example is that an Egyptian artist was known as ""he who keeps alive"", and as part of the tomb etchings an Egyptian would draw every part of the person in likeness, as they believed that would transfer into the afterlife - any such missing limb or foot from the hieroglyph is then assumed also to transfer into the afterlife - and so it became necessary that such bodies were contorted to preserve likeness of the soul. It was an old and tried tradition until Akhenaten, a pharaoh in the New Dynasty, tried to usurp and upset this stern style as it was a change from the multiple gods to one god and the sun rays, but by Tutankhamun's time Egyptian art reverted to its time-old tradition for a thousand more years. Art was thus at this point a form of function, rather than for pleasure. The Minoans and Myceneans shared in the Egyptian art until around 400BC, when Greek art became its own character. Eventually, the Greeks challenged the usual convention of styles and began with a technique called foreshortening on pottery showing their own mythological stories, when a hidden or shortened feature of a foot or arm of the body is still concealed in the picture. This was a striking and deliberate separation from the Egyptian understanding: where the Egyptians used their knowledge, the Greeks used their eyes. He also asserts that an art ""style"" is particularly hard to define except with when it is confined to certain laws, such as the law of perspective and law of diminution of distant objects. It is with the Hellenistic era of Greece and the Empire from Alexander the Great that art develops and becomes its own. No more were works of art done for tribal magic, religion worship, or myths. They start experimenting with capturing the expressions in faces, the idea of harmonised beauty in sculpturing the likeness of human bodies, and studying the fierce emotions and movements of the body - muscle, sinew, and bone all expressed in the marble. Dramatic scenes, such as from the sculpture Laocoon by Alegsander and Polydorus, show exquisite detail and is an exemplar of the ""Greek baroque"" style of the time. With the success of Alexander across the Hellenistic Empire, that skillset was shared across the known world. Where before, rigidity prevented artists to foreshorten, now limbs were being hidden and feet were shown in portrait, which to us would seem ludicrously plain but to them it was a huge step out of the normal circle, as before, it was a step into art for its own sake. It was also from this period that the wealthy and aristocratic class began to collect works of art for pleasure, or to have works of art copied, and privately owned. It demonstrates a markedly different perception of art, from the ancient Greece of Praxiteles to the Hellenistic Greece of Alexander. After Greece it was Rome, where Rome had at first imitated Grecian statues but advanced in civil engineering feats from inspiration. In likeness to Greek columns, the Romans implemented a heirarchy of classical arches from the construction of the wedge-shaped stones. This feat established a newly spectacular form of engineering, known as vaulted roof and dome constructions. Rome had become the epicentre of civil art and its aqueducts, colosseum, roman baths, roman roads, and roman arches and domes. ""Art"" had an unusual military connotation with the Roman Empire, with military strategies, tactics, training, and strength being as though a form of pleasure in the mind and body. The Dark Ages of the Early Middle Era, he explains, is typically referred to the time when the Roman Empire fell, and therefore is listed between AD500-1000, with the High Middle Era of the medieval period thereafter between AD1000-1400, until the Age of Discovery brought the Renaissance to light. This, he does, to then talk through the various movements and styles that emerged in these Ages. As such, Gombrich details the Gothic art movement emerging from the 11th Century - or also known as Norman art - and was dispersed across the world up to the 14th Century. It appeared to convey a sense of commanding power, sturdiness, steadfastness in its buildings with hard symmetrical geometric shapes, stained high-glass windows, as well as implementing traceries and pointed arches that reminisce Roman triumphant arches. During this period, painters began to express their work as a means of capturing the important message of the gospels or of Christ. Suddenly, we start seeing dynamic movements and stories squashed in one fresco, entablature, or sculpture; we see emphases on interest being from telling a sacred story to showing nature in its likeness - people being painted in likeness being an alien technique at this time. Giotto was given by Gombrich as a first-class example, who helped to catapult the arguably slacking Italian painters and sculptors into a new paradigm of work of art, who were taking influence from Byzantine art. Then come the Renaissance period of 15th-16th Centuries, split between Early- and High-Renaissance, meaning rebirth and rediscovering that art which the ancient Romans were involved with. This was the period of extraordinary gift from Donatello, Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Uccello, Francesca, Verrochio, and more. Sfumato was the new technique, an innovation of Da Vinci, that had the paintwork melting and mellowing the outlines within features of the flesh to create a naturally-flowing element, and became popular when noticed from the Mona Lisa painting. It was, however, in the merchant city of Florence where this new innovation was most intensely felt. Baroque art, the succeeding movement to the Renaissance between the 17-18th Centuries, cultivated a strong sense of ""grotesque"" or ""absurd"" techniques and visual details that had artists break away from the traditional classical and ancient Greco-Roman themes and forms. Gombrich brings the specific elements of Baroque art - the elegance, far-reaching, story-driven, emotionally-gripping, emphasis - to life by highlighting Caravaggio's work, Doubting Thomas. Baroque art is characterised by the play on light and shadow, supposedly also as a symbolic gesture of good and bad, and Caravaggio's Doubting Thomas provides a spectacular introductory spectacle of real provocation in both thought and action. Gombrich argues, and I also believe, that Caravaggio must have read the Bible again and again most vigorously to feel the essence of the spookiness, the dark macabre compared with the light salvation reality of the event, the position and posture of the scene as one looks-on as though witnessing it as one of the disciples, the shock of the protagonists, the truly grotesque nature of thrusting the finger in the side and feeling the fleshiness inside, as a point of call to faith. It was a step to exhibiting truth and sincerity, rather than harmony and beauty. All of these should incite a burst of emotion, reacting to the realness, that counteracted the Renaissance ideals of harmony and beauty of the Biblical events. As a point of understanding, Biblical works acted as more than just for the pleasure: they were situated or painted on altars, pews, on murals, on ceilings of churches, as frescoes or triglyphs; Madonnas and the Christ child were sculpted, the Nativity scene, and the Cross, all for new - and old - Christians to understand the stories in an interpreted and illustrated view rather than depending solely on the text, where failure to understand context and cross-reference might prove hard. Pope Gregory the Great once said, at the end of the sixth Century, ""Painting can do for the illiterate what writing does for those who can read"", and was instrumental in helping those against these daring portrayals of sacred beings to understand the benefits, and this line of thinking was prevalent up until the Reformation period of the 16th Century. During the time of the 1600s and 1700s, artists were experimenting with how to perfect techniques of their skills, some wanting to break away from the academic art seen as inadvertently haemorrhaging the freedom of artists to breakaway from perceived rules and laws of Art. Artists, on one hand, may have been delighted with the shift from depending on patrons who would often interfere with their intended works of art, bully them into adding or removing a detail. In saying this, however, what they delighted in losing, they dreaded in gaining another, more tyrannical ruler in nature - that is to say, the buying public, the bourgeois, the acquired taste. The common marketplace and public events were now the place aspiring artists had to go to sell their pieces, or depend on art and picture dealers. Competition now was very stiff. Competition was in fact so very stiff, that by the late 1800s a certain triumvirate of leading original artists - unbeknownst to themselves - would permanently change the world in its understanding of perceiving works of art. These artists would suffer in isolation, and endure condemnation, from the viewing public, and would never see or sniff an ounce of the successes their works would bring, that bore out of feelings of dissatisfaction with the production of art at the time, in particular to academic art. This dissatisfaction then propagated a vast array of new movements, immediately grasping attention to both public and student artist, and grew out new ideals and ways of conveying ideas on canvas. It began the era of what we now know as ""modern art"". These leaders of art, this triumvirate, was Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, and Paul Gauguin. From Van Gogh and his wholesomely bold impasto-style oil paintings provoking his own senses excitement and radically contrasting colours, Expressionism was born; from Cezanne and his determination to bridge the impressionist-style with his experimental use of small brushstrokes to form big fields of intensely bright colours, developing a craving for studying light and direct observation of landscapes, creating a collection of airy paintings, came Cubism; from Gauguin came the influence of the cloisonnist-style known as flat-faced painting, when paintings are void of particular light and shadow, and therefore it paved the way for Primitivism, a mode for recreating the aesthetic appeal of ancient antiquity paintings. One interesting point Gombrich had argued was that there is no such thing as ""Art"", in the sense of snobbery and pretentiousness that comes with an arrogant view of ""Art"", from an observer repeating fancy-sounding terminology and jargon in a museum whilst looking at a Boticelli or Van Eyck, but rather of works of art - where an artist suffers to translate their ideas on to canvas or marble until it is right to them - where we appreciate the mood and relationship between artist and canvas, irrespective of whether we like it or not: that it is rather more profitable to explore each painting in silence and understand it, than to half-know the art but act like you do. We may also be pleasantly surprised, he continues, that we might even prefer the scruffiness of a study sketch rather than a complete picture - and compares Albrecht Durer's painting of a rabbit, to Rembrandt's study of an elephant. The uncertain - perhaps somewhat ugly - scruffiness of the sketch, the excited free-flowing drawn lines capture the eye and it fills in the rest. These artists work to the point of perfection, when no other could add or change it to improve upon it. Overall, this book was a fantastic and easy read, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the works of art that have been produced throughout the ages, as one never finishes being a student of art. It is a story of the ages as told by its art and artists, favoured with extraordinary gift of persuasion and attention to detail, balancing shapes with colours and an imagination translated to canvas. His careful study of the illustrations and ensuring the reader understands his mind, the artists' mind, and what we should hopefully experience from the paintings is reassuring and humble."

I’ve learned so much and have a now a very global comprehension of the art’s development throughout history. It’s well written and very easy to read. It’s quite a long book but it covers most of the basics in one read so it’s very much worth it. Would totally recommend"
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I bought The Story of Art while about to leave Brugge, after a long week-end that was supremely friendly and quite artsy. I started reading this book as soon as I sat down in the train and was enchanted by it until the last page. 's is a masterful story of the main works and styles of art, from 30,000 BC until the 20th century. (The 16th edition includes material from up to around the late 1980s, in terms of art critique, and early 1970s, in terms of artworks.) The book is written from a Western (British) perspective but with enough mentions about Asian and African artworks to make the story global. The types of art covered here are chiefly architecture, picture, and sculpture. There are many things that I liked about this book, from its crisp analysis of artworks to the excellent rhetoric, the latter always in favor of art. The story covers mostly cave painting, ancient art, Greek and Hellenistic art, Roman and Byzantine art, Romanesque and Gothic art, Renaissance and Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo, Romanticism, and Modernism and Post-Modernism. Each style is illustrated with a selection of artworks, many of which are well-known to art beginners such as myself, all of which are discussed not only in terms of craft by also with regard to impact to the age and future art. The first artwork is usually an example of architecture, which is analyzed as a framing reference for smaller artifacts. Artworks from different ages and styles, but depicting similar topics, are compared tetually; I found very useful the detailed comparison references (e.g., ""examples of miniatures as page 211, figure 140, and page 274, figure 177""). There are numerous references to the actual quality of an artwork, which should create a very different impression from the in-book illustration; the book includes often details of the presented works, so that the reader is more easily able to understand its main characteristics. The book concludes with an analysis of art's future. I liked very much the warning that, in the 20th(-21st?) century, a real danger to art is the expectation of non-conformism---Gombrich mentions the ""tradition of the new"" of Harold Rosenberg. The book concludes with a number of additions to the 1950's first edition, and a set of useful editorial tools: an index of terms and works of art, a section of commented related work, a graphical representation of the periods and works of art covered in the main text. Among the main attractions of this book is it's deep yet understandable text. For example, I felt I could really understand the point raised by Gombrich in this paragraph: Among the things I would have liked to see improved in the book, perhaps the main element is the lack of discussion about other forms of art, from literary to performing art, from movies to computer gaming. Another rather negative point is the minimal coverage of Asian and African art, with only scant information and only some late inclusion the 20th century discovery of Greek, Chinese (Terra-Cotta Soldiers), and other artworks. I would have also been happy to see Gombrich's work continued, so that this 16th edition can take a more balanced look at Modernist and Post-Modernist art. One of the elements that turned out to be mostly negative was the detail with which the Modern and Post-Modern periods are covered. In the words of the author: Perhaps the memory of the by-stander, that is, the tendency to observe in more detail current rather than old events, motivates this over-description of material in these sections. Overall, a wonderful read for any art lover."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I decided to reread this after a twelve year gap to see if I would still be stuck with awe and wonder as I was the first time. The answer is yes. To encapsulate ""the story of art"" into one single book is an impossible task, so think of this book as ""a story of art"" written by a white man in the 1950's. He is an incredible knowledgeable and passionate man though, who is a wonderful guide for where to begin in the vast and often intimidating world of Art. Now that I have a tiny bit of footing into the art world, I enjoyed this book more, but was also increasingly acutely aware of the pitfalls of this and other such art- history books that cover large periods of time(in this case from the earliest cave art to the present day.) Having said that, what this book accomplishes is no small feat. Its no wonder this is considered such a classic. The biggest strength of this book is its use simple language, which is actually harder to do than it seems. Its easy to hide behind fancy rhetoric that often obfuscates rather than illuminates. Not a word is wasted and it all makes the most marvelous sense. Its other strength is that it does not mention any artwork in the text that it does not show in the book so the text never degenerates into a list of names that would mean nothing to one who is unacquainted with the work in question. This also leads to a very rigorous selection of artwork without crowding the book with the authors own favorites at the risk of excluding overused and familiar artworks. He states ""..it is meant for those who look for bearing in a new field, and for them the familiar appearance of apparently 'hackneyed' examples may serve as welcome landmarks."" Where it truly shines is that The story of Art teaches you how to look at art. Its like teaching a man to fish. For example, if you've ever looked at medieval art and dismissed it as crude, awkward and badly done this book will give you a pair of fresh eyes. Why was this art was being made? By whom? for whom? And to what end? These people knew how to draw(most of the time, looking at you Bayeux tapestry), but it wasn't important to the artist as long as all the symbols that were needed to get the message across were present. The idea was to communicate a message effectively and these paintings do that exceedingly well. He explains the idea through Egyptian art which we may dismiss as flat and 2-D but it was the symbolism and message of the art that mattered, there was no room for confusion. Everything had to be represented in its most characteristic angle, so the face in profile, the eye from straight ahead, as was the torso, and the limbs sideways again as they are best seen. These strict rules were followed by all Egyptian artists, they couldn't leave anything out, perhaps for magical purposes? You learn to look at art through the intentions of the artist which were often shaped by the period of history they inhabited. Because Art and Architecture are inextricably linked together there is a section in each chapter on the architectural developments of various periods which, though very brief, does round off the picture of the period really well as well as providing a great jumping off point for further inquiry. After all, most of this amazing painting and sculpture was made to be housed in actual buildings right? Also, it shows you how the ancient traditions in architecture have trickled down into modern times, there might be a piece of ancient Greek building tradition in your town! A second reading after a long gap is a richer and more enjoyable experience as I can now disagree with many of the opinions stated(oh the joys of being contrarian) since I have been exposed to alternate histories and interpretations. For example, did Titian really die of the plague at 99? apparently not. Is Giorgione's ""the tempest "" most likely just based on a Greek myth or was it more of a comment on society. Who knows, its all quite mysterious. In conclusion, anyone who has even a slight inkling towards the world of art and is looking for an accessible introduction will definitely find value in this book."

You can not write, or read, intelligently on all types of art, in all periods, all over the world with the same degree of appreciation or interest. Gombtrich's history is of course very Euro-centric and very old fashioned, in today's terms, in what is considered the 'important' areas in the history of art. But what he does write about is written intelligently and well. I am in two minds about this book, I don't really care of universal histories but if you are going to buy one then this is not bad, but how it would fare as text book today is impossible for me to say. If it gets someone in reading more, and exploring more art, of any type then it has done its job."

It is divided into 28 chapters, each which explains in detail a movement or period in art history. He covers most of the Big Names, although sometimes it feels as though he is trying to squeeze everything in. My main complaints are that it is very Western-centred and feels a little dated, and only includes ONE female artist, which feels like a massive oversight, particularly as he doesn’t even address the lack of female artists. Despite this, it’s a great book and really helped me to educate myself on a broad range of artists, periods and movements. Although it’s slightly dated, it remains a classic."

Gombrich isn't just an art historian,he's like a psychologist, I felt like I had a better understanding of why people were making all this funky contemporary art; even if I still don't necessary like or understand it, at least I kind of feel I see where it's coming from. Really a great book if you want a basic intro to the history of art."

Naturally the presumption to offer a monolithic story of art is absurd - but this particular story is well worth sharing."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Gombrich provides a comprehensive history of art from early primitive works to the end of the second world war. This book provides an overview to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for art by understanding how it has developed throughout human history. He eloquently describes works created by the great masters in a loving and cherished diction, providing a soothing and pleasurable read. There are certain periods of art history that I do not find as interesting, which caused certain chapters of books to be slower reads. That being said, the book does a great job of achieving its purpose: to provide a high level overview of the entirety of Art History for the lay reader. The book can best be summarized by Gombrich's introduction, ""People who have acquired some knowledge of art history are sometimes in danger of falling into a similar trap.. When they see a work of art they do not stay to look at it, but rather search their memory for the appropriate label. They may have heard that Rembrandt was famous for his - which is the Italian technical term for light and shade - so they nod wisely when they see a Rembrandt, mumble 'wonderful ' and wander on to the next picture. I want to be quite frank about this danger of half-knowledge and snobbery, for we are all apt to succumb to such temptations, and a book like this could increase them. I should like to help open eyes, not loosen tongues. To talk cleverly about art is not very difficult, because the words critics use have been employed in so many different contexts that they have lost all precision. But to look at a picture with fresh eyes and to venture on a voyage of discovery into it is far more difficult but also much more a rewarding task. There is no telling what one might bring home from such a journey."" (18)"

It was easy-reading – staying conversational and not getting too in-depth with the facts. It also had a lot of photos, which is a huge plus for me. As I got deeper into the book, however, the author had to reference way too much among the previous pages to make for easy reading. In the end, I can’t say this is anything more than a good textbook for a high school or college course. I like to casually read about art, but this became more than casual in approach. Not a bad book, just not exactly what I was looking for."

Particularly helpful are the references to works mentioned in previous pages or chapters and includes page numbers for easy browsing. Wish the man lived longer and kept updating the book with new chapters for each past decade. Saying that it is highly recommended is stating the obvious.

As a result of this it's not that easy to pick up, read, and consistently return to. I'm also happy to have one of the later editions of the book, as the chapters at the end offer interesting insight into art criticism and art historians. Honestly, I found this post script more enjoyable to read than some of the other sections of the book, which maybe means that I've been reading the wrong kind of art book. Either way, happy to have finished it as it serves as a great contextual jumping-off point if I ever wanted to explore any art movement more in depth. Worth the read."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In all honesty, I should have read this book before I even entered college or changed my major from journalism to art history, but now I am a college graduate, entering a Renaissance art graduate program, and I figured I needed some concise background information, so I decided to finally read this quite excessively long book. Gombrich does an excellent job summing up ancient and medieval art— I had never learned much about it in my undergraduate courses other than from the influence of Apollo Belvedere or Venus de Milo or Laocoon & His Sons on the artwork of the Renaissance, and I appreciated how he made it readable and understandable. When I got to the Renaissance, I got a little annoyed at some of the assumptions and implications that Gombrich wrote into the book— a lot of this didn’t seem like things I had learned in the Renaissance courses I have taken. The modern chapters (after Impressionism) were where I really got tripped up— this book was originally written in 1950, and of course Gombrich had no idea at the time that some artists working before that year would eventually become world renowned (and he even acknowledges this many times in his afterword) but the way he wrote in this chapter seemed uneven and not in line with how he discussed ancient and Renaissance art— almost like he was saying “All right well I guess I have to talk about this now.” Another thing I did not care for were how Gombrich would devote tiny tiny paragraphs to an artist, in any time period, who is now quite moderately well known, would then direct you to a sample of their artwork in the back of the book (and never even their best or most famous piece of artwork) and then move on. Why even include this random interlude if it’s better for you to just give us an overview? Ultimately I really appreciated how this book tied up a lot of loose ends for me before I begin my art history graduate program; Gombrich almost seamlessly ties the entire history of art from ancient Greeks to modern times and even though everything in me thinks that this is almost impossible, well, then Gombrich achieved the impossible. There is so much more to be said about the history of art, even at an introductory level, and sometimes I personally believe that Gombrich spent too much time on the wrong things. But in the end I’m glad I read this, and if you’re thinking of studying the history of art in college, read this and John Berger’s Ways of Seeing beforehand for a good head start."

Still, up to and including the beginning of the 20th Century, it's a fascinating read, and contains a wonderful history that charts most of the major movements and gives a great overview of how different sections of western art relate to each other. As the 20th Century progresses, however, one gains the impression that Gombrich loses heart somewhat, and the last sections of the book turn into little more than a lament at the direction in which art is heading. This leads to strange exclusions from the book (Pollock is in there, and Pop Art is rapidly dismissed, but Bacon and Rothko are entirely ignored). Still, it's a book that's remained essential reading for over half a century for a good reason, and it's well worth looking into."

Gombrich combines an encyclopedic knowledge about Art with his unique “anti-encyclopedic” insights: all the time he calls our attention to what’s really going on, how things connect to each other, the precise aspect that’s really important - and interesting - to take away, and so in. The introduction alone is a full journey into Art. I love that he chose the word “Story” instead of “History”: it’s all about the humans behind the works, starting with the very first phrase of the book: “THERE really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.” An awesome book to read as a story, and come back to, over and over. P.S.: his “history for kids” book is also awesome!"

Gombrich knows that what we humans recognize are patterns and a story is a pattern of information. We like them so much, we even learn them for fun. He uses the story format to convey a sense of consistency throughout the things he's trying to get across and succeeds in making his readers retain that knowledge."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have heard of this book for some time but was always intimidated by its volume. At the start of this year, when I was strolling around in Cambridge, a place with lots of dear memory, I found a second-hand version of this book, with a flyer for a Degas exhibition inside. Opening the book that night at the hotel, the scent of old books struck me and I immediately indulged in the book. Five stars would be too few for this book. I wish I had started this book sooner - even before I knew this book. I wish I had read this in my early year of high school. It might have changed my life forever. Well, I think it has certainly changed me a lot during these several months. History is not my thing - I changed high school because I wouldn't need to study history in my new school. I have always found history dull and historians' fixation on years and meaning boring. However, this book on art history is educating and beautiful at the same time. I have rarely come across books and articles with such language as clear flowing water while stating the points clearly. The style of the language is a little bit old-school, which is a good thing in my view. Nowadays authors are no longer writing in such a modest but graceful way. I was touched deeply several times in my read. It wasn't because I was made sad, it was purely touching. The words and the images just stirred my emotion somehow. It was simply the power of art, I think. “There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists - men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful fit of balancing shapes and colours till they are ‘right’, and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work. Artists, we trust, will always be born. But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.” I came to tears when I read this. So many thoughts and memory came into my mind. I recall the time when I was happily doodling with my crayons, when my grandfather drew the scene of his childhood memory when we had projects about different art styles, when my art teachers patiently guided me through the steps of calligraphy arts, when I first came to the UK and visit the National Gallery with my friends… I wish I have more encounters with arts, I wish I had started sooner, but it’s never too late to start appreciating and reflecting. By talking about Art in such an engaging way, this book is a piece of art itself. Getting close to the end of the book, a rush of sadness came into me, and I couldn’t wait to read it again and again."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Just got through the last 4 chapters of the book and found myself so into it. I had never known that history book can be as captivating as this one. The narrative style is great, which helps to make sense of all the ambiguous events and movements in the history of art. I would give Sir Gombrich 5 stars for his talent of clarify things. This book is a helpful resource of radical explanations and supportive examples which helps me to strenthen my arguments on my crtitical analysis. It aims at answering my greatest concern toward the history of art: ""In which standard we define art ?"" All the examples were refered to this book. .. Inspecting the history of art from the nineteenth century, I am coming up with a very basic question: ""In which standard we define art ? Or is there a standard or a necessity to form ?"". As most art debates has no end and a question always provokes an infinite sequence of many other ones, I failed to determine a yes or no answer after the research but found it able to present several arguments. In the earlier period of time, the art standard was mainly set by artworks showing supreme skills of from leading masters, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Ruben, Goya,.. As there was an inevitable agreement on the level of excellence in their artworks, the definition of art at that time was concrete to define. However, the perception of art had changed so far that artistic expertise had no longer been judged merely by the objective supreme painting skills but by subjective approach. While the old school art theory presents an objective standard with definition of line, form, shape, color to define art value, the new school states that art is wholly subjective which determine a mean to expressing individuality. By this theory, artwork is evaluated through its capacity to impact viewer emotionally, psychologically, physically and spiritually. Though each school of thoughts present its drawback, does what matters just which school of thought that we choose to embrace ? The old school criticism prompts people to categorize art as orthodox art vs unorthodox art, low art vs high art, art vs non-art etc. It is needless to indicate the obsoleteness of the old-school objective criticism, which was confirmed in every period of the art development. The first reason is that most artists in every period had the great tendency to break the tradition. For instance,I take an insignificant but particular example of Edouard Manet (1832- 1883), one of the avant-garde who started the art revolution in French. By examining the traditional convention in painting of his time, he discovered that the whole claim of it was wholly based on misconception of shade and light, which made the representation of object in traditional art at that time very artificial. That said, the emergence of all art movements were fostered by the courage of artists to fearlessly examine the traditional convention, the quarrel they endured with the preceding masters and the desire of escaping from the deadlock that they found themselves in. Therefore, using objective convention from tradition to measure art can be improper. The second reason is that any definition on which we rely to evaluate art have been disparate through time. For instance, even the most successful art movement, French Impressionism was substantially rejected by not only critics but all section of public in its beginning. Impressionist’s painting was once thought to be mad and unorthodox because the viewers claimed they saw nothing in those paintings except a confusion of brushstroke. For a century later, since we extol Impressionism as the legend for innovation in art that moved art away from the precise imitation of reality to the representation of what we really see things, it is hard for us to understand why Impressionist had met such rejection at that period. But it is a considerable example for how definition of orthodox art differs over different period of time. Since, it is unavoidable to state every objective standard formed will soon be replaced by another one. On the other hand, the subjective approach to art criticism results in the likeliness to mislead the evaluation of art. There are many modern artworks which are personally hard to understand. They are, for example, the Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings of dripping paint, the Black Square(1915) by Malevich or the Fountain of Marcel Duchamp(1917). Since I am clueless to find the level of supreme skills in the creation of these works labelled as art, I find the necessity to rely on the new school of thought to define the artistic value in those works. However, owing to the subjectivity, it is likely to use the new school of thought as an excuse for poor artistic skill and an exhaustion of creativity. Hence there is a tendency that the art value is exaggerated by critics, while the artists’ attempt might only is to shock the public and stand out. Since there is no concrete standard to judge, the art evaluation leaves a huge gap of ambiguity. Art is both unnecessary and unable to be standardized The perception to art considerably fluctuates. Gombrich stated that artists only mission is to create things, which had never existed before. That explains why artist always struggle to break the tradition, seek for new problem and solution for unsolved issue. I take Paul Cezanne as an example. As the current Impressionism had gained a complete triumph in making a conquest of nature, Cezanne decided that there would be no gain to pursue that movement further; then he tried to start everything from scratch again, seeked for new problems and struggled to solved it. Thanks to his endeavour, new possibilities in art had been explored which fostered the new art movement in the early 20th century. That said, it is impossible to standardize art. Due to the perpetual finding of new problems to solve, artists always dissatisfied with the current standard. Since Cezanne felt the loss of the sense of order and balance; Van Gogh felt art lost the sense of intensity and passion; Gauguin dissatisfied with current life and art; their struggle to find solution urge to the start of three new movements, respectively Cubism, Expressionism and Primitivism. Gombrich also indicated that the modern art we see today mostly grew out from the feelings of dissatisfaction that is just mentioned. Once again, the art history proved the unnecessity of such art standard as well as the impossibility to form an art definition because every standard established will be soon intentionally challenged and altered. “ Art history is a weaving and changing of tradition, in which each works refer to the past and point to the future.” There is no such thing as art. There are only people willing to undergo the long run of finding solution for new coming problems who are labelled as artists (Gombrich, 2006). And then what makes their works differentiated is how long their value remained to be praised through time. The continual emergence of new perception in art is a great stimulation for the new possibilities."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Enjoy it for What It Is... I was recommended this book as somebody who knew nothing about art. And I struggle to imagine a better presented introduction to this vast topic. The author states in the fifteenth edition preface ‘In writing [this book] I thought first and foremost of readers… who had just discovered the world of art for themselves.’ And I felt he guided me through the labyrinth in a straight line. The book presents a chronological story. ‘The story’ begins with some of the earliest known examples of cave images. It continues through ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and China before continuing its predominant focus on Europe until reaching the present day. It touches on the influence of art on these societies and the influence of these societies on art. Methods and trends are also touched on. And on occasion it links generations of artists’ stories together such as Leonardo to Michelangelo to Raphael. It contains illustrations throughout. These illustrations are referred to by the text. I think criticisms of this book come when one takes it out of context. Any criticism I have heard, always from a connoisseur, can be summarized in one sentence: A more accurate title would be ‘A Story of Predominately Western Art’. However, if this book is taken as the author intended it to be, one will struggle to find any book that better achieves such an ambitious intention."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It is a pleasure to read story of art -some part of it as the focus is European art - as a continuous weaving of many creators, disobedient minds , sometimes heretics and changers of traditions , challenging the past with dissatisfaction and pointing the future with an inevitable end to be challenged as a past chapter of the story. It is still provocative after many years , although it may be classified as an introductory book , for thoughts about the question of what art is or whether there is something called art or there is just artist as Gombrich wrote at the introduction of the book . Then the questions : all this is about what ? Mimesis, expression , kind of construction of another realm , just something new ? It is good to have these questions in mind while going through the centuries behind the stories of many artists looking for ways to create , express, challenge. Probably the pleasure was endorsed as I read the copy from 1950 , third edition which has been at my library for last 30 years waiting to be read. As art is a shelter against the dismay, these Pandemic days was probably time to read it."

I started looking at buildings with different eyes. I started analyzing all the museums I've been to and all the paintings I've seen. I was calling my friends in the middle of the night to ask them if they knew something I read and seemed so logical and yet we haven't thought about it. This book is amazing for people who desire a brief introduction into Arts and need something to start with. What I missed (and even the author has a long ""disclaimer"" about it) was more info and appreciation on Contemporary Art. I understand why it is difficult to write about something happening now and I understand there are a large number of artists to pick from. But nevertheless I felt Gombrich does not really appreciate Contemporary Art. I was disappointed about his presentation on Surrealism but as I kept reading I understood his point of view. That being said, the book is a fantastic introduction into visual arts up to Surrealism. After that point everything is open for debate :)"

And exceedingly good book, circumventing the jargon and pompousness of art historians, it illustrates the history - and story - of art in a most down-to-earth manner, clearly and concisely. For the uneducated reader as myself, it was an unparalleled reading. I guess the most striking element is Prof. Gombrich's ascetic take, to only mention and explore works of art contained in the book, discerning with clarity their composition, which techniques were employed in their creation, and above all, how their story interlaced, what changes came with the years, the problems of each generation, the composers and artists who tackled them - who succeeded, and why."

Gombrich has a very classic and smooth style of writing about Art. He summarized the history of art from the ancient era into contemporary in 27 chapters. Followed by a chapter that revealed his approach towards visual art. The writer picked some of the most distinguished paintings in each era, which crystalized the main figures and approach of drawings then. The book is writing in a first person narrator as a story to be retold unlike the documentaries books. Moreover, it has a plenty of visual art and paintings revealing the schools of art followed by a detailed timeline and a map to follow the era were discussed in the book.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What a tremendous resource for learning about art - and instantly an all-time favorite book of mine. The narration is engaging and accessible, and the setup of this edition (with text in front and illustrations arranged in back) made it easy to follow along and study each exhibit. I gained a real appreciation for the overall ’story of art’ - the themes at play and problems and solutions faced by and encountered by art in various historical and social contexts - as well as fantastic introductions to many significant artists. The original book was published shortly after WW2, and since then Gombrich added several additional intro and conclusion sections in subsequent editions, which can be found here and serve as nice time capsules. The central takeaways of this book for me are 1) there is no art without artists 2) the story of art is a nonlinear one without any defined endpoint, with plenty of zigs and zags, as solutions are devised to solve problems which then open up new problems 3) art requires some societal/historical motivational core (the grain at the center of a pearl) to thrive. * Primitive art - drawing faces from individual shapes; evolution from there to new types of art was not about advances in technology, but changes in ideas (of what should be depicted and how) * Egypt - particular style of painting, everything follows set laws (depicting human body parts in different ways / planes based on how they were best conveyed rather than how they appeared) - little evolution over time (until Tut, new ways of depicting); sacred purpose of portraits in tombs. Painting from knowledge. * Greek revolution: bursts of creativity, adherence to Egyptian technique combined with freedom to deviate from sacred rules on human form; beginnings of foreshortening; Athenian democracy ~ evolving identity of artists; paintings / statues alongside poems and plays as things to discuss. Portraits evolved later in Greek era - sculptures of Alexander. * Hellenistic art - Greek civilization spread via Alexander, into ‘Hellenistic’ world. Art became intentionally more impressive (Corinthian columns evolving from Doric/Ionic). Rich people collecting art made artists more important; prevalence of art in Pompeii (an otherwise ordinary provincial town in Hellenic world) illustrates this evolution * Rome - borrowing things they liked from Greece; triumphal arches / columns (influenced sacred depictions in Jewish, Indian art) * Religion and art - what can / should be depicted? Pope Gregory - art educates the illiterate and has important purpose * Major significance of Byzantine art - images as holy, maintained old eastern / Egyptian traditions and fused to religious art - preserved traditions for later eras, provided bridge to Renaissance * Middle ages / dark ages * Local tribal art fused with Christianity * Egyptians painted what they knew; Greeks what they saw; Middle Ages what they felt (religious depictions convey this). Middle Ages survival bias - religious art lasted, privately owned art destroyed * Evolution of Norman / Romanesque architecture styles. Gothic - extension of Romanesque, greater use of arches, expanding into stained glass. Gothic art - methods of art as means to end, of telling sacred stories better * Giotto (Florence 13th century) - begins era of artist as part of history of art; first artist to harness Hellenistic technique preserved by Byzantines, add creativity, and transform Gothic lifelike sculpture into painting * International style (14th century) - Italian (kept Byzantine art alive) and French ideas spread across Europe; depicting nature became important -> depicting humans accurately -> renewal of classical styles * Renaissance - key pillars: 1) scientific / mathematical perspective 2) close observation of nature / understanding of human anatomy 3) learning from antiquity / classical forms of sculpture, architecture, art * Early Renaissance pioneers: Brunelleschi, Donatello (architecture, sculpture) * Northern vs Southern Renaissance: Italian art began with scientific perspective / outlines / understanding of body; Dutch added detail upon detail to resemble reality (van Eyck - oil painting) * High Renaissance in Florence / Rome - changing status of artist, determination to be more than craftsman, equal with scholar or poet. Leonardo - use of science to elevate painting above humble art; sfumato technique - blurring of outlines + mellow colors allowing merging of forms, leaving more to viewer’s imagination. Michelangelo - papal commissions, extended Leonardo’s focus on human body and emphasized this exclusively, accurate painting of form. Raphael - ‘idea of beauty’, simplicity of Madonnas, fluidity of bodies in motion. * Venice - Titian, expert handling of paint - allowed to break rules of composition (position of virgin etc) and make up for it with colors. Bellini, Correggio - use of color and light to balance forms. Importance of color in Venice, influenced by eastern linkages. * Spread into north. Durer - studied in southern Europe and traveled to Venice as artist; combined northern (earlier Gothic) style (nature, extreme detail) with Italian Renaissance ideals of beauty - to tell sacred stories. Bosch - synthesis of old (primal fears, depictions of evil) with new (methods of portraying) * Later Renaissance - crises of art in 16th century; idea that art had reached perfection in Renaissance, so what to do next? * Mannerism (imitation of Michelangelo), Parmigiano, Cellini - quest for unusual / interesting even at expense of natural beauty (modern) * Southern art: Tintoretto - legacy of Titian painting, fused with mystery - feel thrill and tension of drama (St Mark’s remains, St George / dragon). El Greco - Spanish mysticism, also realist portraiture * Reformation challenges in north - outlawing of religious imagery removed major market for art. Great artists left for England - Holbein the Younger - portraits of masterly restraint painted at Henry VIII court. Dutch art survived Reformation best - genre paintings, follies of everyday life - Bruegel the Elder * 17th century: Baroque / neoclassical art, following from Greco / Tintoretto (complicated compositions, showcasing light and color) * Rome: schools of Caracci v Caravaggio. Caracci - classical scenes, beauty, inspiration by Raphael - development of neoclassical style (influenced Reni, Poussin, Lorrain - who influenced later landscape painters). Caravaggio - naturalism, faithful looks at nature, truth over beauty - unafraid to paint ugliness of reality. * Rubens - synthesis of Caracci (classical scenes) with Caravaggio (naturalism) and Flemish/Dutch tradition (not focused on standards of beauty, attention to detail). Ability to make scenes (large scale or portraits) come to life in ‘painterly’ way. * Artists influenced by Rubens. Van Dyck - painter at court of Charles I, elegant portraits of royals. Velásquez - court of Philip IV in Spain, learned from Italy - inspired initially by Caravaggio, then by Rubens and Titian; forerunner of Impressionism, capturing real moments (Las Meninas) * Protestant Northern Europe: changing marketplace post-Reformation; commission practice ending, so artists had to sell art to public, leading to greater specialization. Growing embrace of idea of ‘picturesque’ landscapes. Rembrandt - etchings, inspired by Caravaggio; self portraits, portraits - sense of being face to face with real people, illustrating depth of souls, displaying ability to understand all types of men; light and shade used to enhance scene’s drama. Still lifes - subject became incidental to importance of painting. Vermeer, still lifes with people - unique contrast of mellowness / precision * 18th century: peak of Baroque art/architecture around 1700 * Versailles as epitome of baroque styling (without baroque approach would be monotonous); boom in similar palaces and monasteries around Europe. Decline in importance of individual arts - art focused on building these grand spaces. * England. St Paul’s - baroque or not? Restrained, Italian Renaissance styling, church as place for contemplation not otherworldly vision. Country house > palace; classical stylings that don’t break rules; legacy of Claude Lorrain. Hogarth - moral tales in engravings. Reynolds (founded Royal Academy) vs Gainsborough; parallel to Caracci/Caravaggio. Reynolds - favored imitation of Italian Renaissance masters (similar thinking to Caracci), elevation of painting as intellectual pursuit, importance of painter’s ideas; paintings sometimes a bit labored. Gainsborough - simplicity, nature as teacher, straightforward portraits emphasizing good brushwork, and landscapes. * New directions around French Revolution: growing collector taste for novelty; shift from old ways of teaching to academies (created new crises of lack of interest in new art vs old, and unsubtle works at academy shows); embrace of older styles (Classical Greek, Gothic) in favor of baroque / rococo / neoclassical architecture in US. * Portrayal of recent history and heroic figures with lessons for present - Copley, Jacques-Louis David. Goya - portraits in style of old masters (Van Dyck ) with artistic skill of Titian, but new eyes and lack of flattery. Romantic poetry spilling into painting - painting from inner vision, Goya and Blake. * Popularity of landscapes - 2 camps in England. Turner - obsessed with improving on traditions (Claude Lorrain) - motion and complexity, human emotion reflected in nature. Constable - no need for trickery, honest simplicity best - don’t outshine nature. * 19th century: industrial revolution, mass production, decline in public taste - conflict between artists and public, split between artists doing ‘official’ work and those outside mainstream. Paris as center of art world. * France: Ingres (conservative painter following David, technical smooth perfection) vs Delacroix (movement, excitement of a scene). Corot as a bridge in approaches: capture truth in general forms / tones - achievements of palette (use of colors harmonized with gradation of tone). Barbizon school - following Constable, seeing nature with fresh eyes; Millet - landscape approach taken to figures; Courbet - realism a la Caravaggio. Rossetti, pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, truth over beauty - artistic dead end? * Impressionism - beginning of idea of art as studying/solving particular problems. Manet - revolution in depicting colors; classical masters of color as inspiration (Titian, Velásquez, Goya); illusion of depth via simple flat forms. Monet - painting in front of motif rather than studio; technological changes e.g rapid strokes and no time to mix paints, effect of whole over specific details. Renoir - inspired by crowd scenes (following Jan Steen), but shifted focus onto effect of light. Degas - ballet, unexpected angles used to study space / forms; objective / dispassionate (interest in movement / space, not in beauty of subject). Rodin - unfinished looking works. Contributing factors to development of Impressionism: 1) photography (art needed to evolve new aims) 2) Japanese woodblock prints becoming prevalent and introducing new ideas of perspective / completeness. Ideas around Impressionism - ideas of finishedness (borrowed from Rembrandt - artist’s right to declare when finished); overcoming knowledge of form as obstacle to enjoyment. * Late 19th century: triumph of Impressionism, what next? 3 post impressionist masters - dissatisfied in different ways, led to new traditions of modern art. Shared willingness to sacrifice correctness of outlines to accomplish different aims. None of these artists were well-known/understood in their times. * Cezanne - felt order/balance lost in Impressionist messiness; sought reconciliation of methods of Impressionism (paint what one saw) with balance/harmony (‘paint Poussin from nature’); influenced Cubism * Van Gogh - felt intensity / passion of art was lost in focus on visual impression. Brushstrokes to convey artist’s excitement (flamelike strokes); influenced Expressionism * Gauguin - dissatisfied generally with life and art, aimed for simplicity through exploration of native culture; influenced Primitivism * Modern art. Influence of architecture - Bauhaus, functionalism. Extension of ideas of what painter should paint - paint what he sees? We can’t separate what we see from what we know. * Expressionism - painting of feelings, Munch’s scream; focus not just on pleasant things. Abstract art - Kandinsky first to paint without recognizable object. * Fauvism - Matisse, 1900s Paris. Decorative simplification, use of colors. Cubism, Picasso - problems of form; one solution to essential tension in art (depth on surface), experiments in modeling; recognizable objects, pictures made of uniform parts so whole looks consistent in spite of unfamiliarity. Return to Egyptian principles of painting from knowledge of objects. Klee - new possibilities of forms, nature creates through artist; artist creates something new rather than replicating reality. * Primitivism - lasting effects of Gauguin, theme that influenced much later art - quest for native/childlike simplicity - Rousseau, Chagall, Wood. Surrealism - Freudian inspiration, dreamscapes; Magritte (self portrait of artist creating new reality), Dali. Pollock, start of AbEx - unifying two strands 1) childlike simplicity / spontaneity 2) sophisticated interest in problems of painting * What drives art? Core task set by community / society; always new challenges to pursue even as art evolved, new solutions led to new challenges. Modern art - prevalence of old/new theories provide core impetus for art’s evolution."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In the good old days, a young man would go on a grand tour in order to visit the remains of classical civilization in Italy and Greece. As an aristocrat, one could expect to gain admittance to fine private collections in the possession of the leading families in each locality and, not only that, to be regaled with lectures on them by resident experts. What can one do to further his self-education these days in an era of lesser culture? By serendipity, at the public library of late this recensionist happened upon the present work by the noted art historian E.H. Gombrich, (Phaidon, originally published in 1950 and most recently reprinted in 2022), which promises to go a long way towards making up the gap for us, less favored contemporaries. The text in this pocket edition, with all the additions accumulated in later editions comes to 502 pages along with an appendix collecting the 413 illustrations, most in color. A glance at the table of contents shows how rich is the fare on offer here: 1 strange beginnings; 37, art for eternity (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete); 49, great awakening (Greece to 5th c); 63, realm of beauty (Greece to 1st c. ad); 81, world conquerers (Romans, Buddhists, Jews, Christians to 4 th c); 93, A parting of ways (Rome and Byzantium, 5th to 13th c.); 103, Looking eastwards (Islam, China 2nd c to 13th c); 111, Western art in the melting pot (Europe, 6th to 11th c.); 119, Church militant (12th c); 129, Church triumphant (13th c.); 139, courtiers and burghers (14th c.); 155, conquest of reality (early 15th c.); 167, tradition and innovation I (Italy later 15th c.); 183, tradition and innovation II (15th c. in north); 201, harmony attained (early 16th c.); 215, light and color (Venice early 16th c.); 247, new learning spreads (Germany and Netherlands early 16th c.); 257, crisis of art (Europe later 16th c.); 273, vision and visions (Catholic Europe 16th c.); 293, mirror of nature (Holland 17th c.); 315, power and glory I (Italy 17th - 18th c.); 331, power and glory II (France, Germany, Austria 17th to 18th c.); 339, age of reason (England and France 18th c.); 347, break in tradition (England, America, France 18th to 19th c.); 361, permanent revolution (19th c.); 379, in search of new standards (late 19th c.); 411, experimental art (first half 20th c.); 429, a story without end (465-502). Let us reproduce a few striking quotations in order to illustrate Gombrich’s style: It is true that some artists or critics in certain periods have tried to formulate laws of their art; but it always turned out that poor artists did not achieve anything when trying to apply these laws, while great masters could break them and yet achieve a new kind of harmony no one had thought of before. [pp. 31-32] Egyptian painters had a very different way from our of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artist’s task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. [pp. 51-52] It is this balance between an adherence to rules and a freedom within the rules which has made Greek art so much admired in later centuries. [pp. 72-73] But the forms which the artists used in this new attempt were not the simple forms of primitive art, but the developed forms of Greek painting. Thus Christian art of the Middle Ages became a curious mixture of primitive and sophisticated methods. [pp. 106-107] As we look at the mosaics done by these Greek artists in the Balkans and in Italy in the Middle Ages, we see that this Oriental empire had in fact succeeded in reviving something of the grandeur and majesty of ancient Oriental art, and in using it for the glorification of Christ and his power. [p. 109] Buddhism influenced Chinese art not only by providing the artists with new tasks. It introduced an entirely new approach to pictures, a reverence for the artist’s achievement such as did not exist either in ancient Greece or in Europe up to the time of the Renaissance. The Chinese were the first people who did not think of the making of pictures as a rather menial task, but who placed the painter on the same level as the inspired poet. [pp. 113-114] That is, perhaps, how religious art in China came to be employed less for telling the legends of the Buddha and the Chinese teachers, less for the teaching of a particular doctrine – as Christian art was to be employed in the Middle Ages – than as an aid to the practice of meditation. Devout artists began to paint water and mountains in a spirit of reverence, not in order to teach any particular lesson, nor merely as decorations, but to provide material for deep thought….The Chinese, therefore, consider it childish to look for details in pictures and then to compare them with the real world. They want, rather, to find in them the visible traces of the artist’s enthusiasm. [pp. 114-115] In pictures like these we see the emergence of a new medieval style which made it possible for art to do something that neither ancient Oriental nor classical art had done: the Egyptians lad largely drawn what they to exist, the Greeks what they ; in the Middle Ages the artist also learned to express in his picture what he . [p. 124] There was naturally more contact than formerly with the art of Byzantium, and many artists of the twelfth century tried to imitate and emulate the majestic sacred images of the Eastern Church. At no other time, in fact, did European art approach the ideals of this kind of Eastern art more closely than at the height of the Romanesque style. [p. 134] Painting was indeed on the way to becoming a form of writing in pictures; but this return to more simplified methods of representation gave the artist of the Middle Ages a new freedom to experiment with more complex forms of composition (composition = putting together). Without these methods the teachings of the Church could never have been translated into visible shapes. [pp. 135-136] We have just compared the art of the Romanesque period with the art of Byzantium and even of the ancient Orient. But there is one respect in which Western Europe always differed profoundly from the East. In the East these styles lasted for thousands of years, and there seemed no reason why they should ever change. The West never knew this immobility. It was restless, groping for new solutions and new ideas. The Romanesque style did not even outlast the twelfth century. [p. 139] But for all that, it may be useful to remember that in real history there are no new chapters and no new beginnings, and that it detracts nothing from Giotto’s greatness if we realize that his methods owe much to the Byzantine masters, and his aims and outlook to the great sculptors of the northern cathedrals….Nothing like this had been done for a thousand years. Giotto had rediscovered the art of creating the illusion of depth on a flat surface. For Giotto this discovery was not only a trick to be displayed for its own sake. It enabled him to change the whole conception of painting. Instead of using the methods of picture-writing he could create the illusion that the sacred story was happening before our very eyes….Giotto’s method is completely different. Painting, for him, is more than a substitute for the written word. We seem to witness the real event as if it were enacted on a stage….From his day onwards the history of art, first in Italy and then in other countries also, is the history of the great artists. [pp. 150-153] To see and observe nature with ever-fresh eyes, to discover and enjoy ever-new harmonies of colors and lights, had become the essential task of the painter. In this new zeal, the great masters of Catholic Europe found themselves at one with the painters on the other side of the political barrier, the great artists of the Protestant Netherlands. [p. 313] In earlier periods it was usually the leading masters, artists whose skill was supreme, who also received the most important commissions and therefore became very famous. Think of Giotto, Michelangelo, Holbein, Rubens or even Goya. This does not mean that tragedies could never occur or that no painter was ever insufficiently honored in his country, but by and large the artists and their public shared certain assumptions and therefore also agreed on standards of excellence. It was only in the nineteenth century that the real gulf opened between the successful artists – who contributed to ‘official art’ – and the nonconformists, who were mainly appreciated after their death. The result is a strange paradox. Even today there are few specialists who know much about the ‘official art’ of the nineteenth century. [p. 384] Another attractive feature of Gombrich’s study is the clarity with which he traces the emergence and subsequent development of themes throughout the history of art. A sampling of these would include the following: 1) How the position of the artist changed during the nineteenth century – may we draw a parallel with the natural sciences today? For just as the artist in the nineteenth century became increasingly set loose from the need to depict customary subject matters, so too in our times in theoretical physics, scientists have become unmoored from the requirement to connect their ideas closely with experiment, leading to a subjective style that the commentator John Horgan calls post-modern or ‘ironic science’. 2) Remarking upon this development in the art world, Gombrich declares that ‘the idea that the true purpose of art was to express personality could gain ground only when art had lost every other purpose’ [p. 384] – resembling somewhat how, around the same time, existentialism emerges in philosophy, for only those who have received no character of their own from their upbringing are attracted by it! 3) At the conclusion of the original text as of 1950, Gombrich reflects on how modern art fares after the artist cannot set to work directed by some purpose, imposed upon him by his patron or by tradition. This classic may be depended upon for training one’s eye to see what is there in a work of art: for the author excels at dispensing a handful of simple pointers to characteristics of style while not descending into an exhaustive discussion of rules or technicalities. A great deal of Gombrich’s expertise goes into a discriminating selection of what paintings to show and discretion as to what to say about them and what to leave out – precisely what AI knows nothing about! Nowadays, everyone reflexively turns to the internet whenever a question arises. While this manner of proceeding does yield instant gratification, it tends, once one becomes habituated to it, to a piecemeal and fragmented acquisition of knowledge that winds up being very deficient compared to the systematic induction into a field one would derive from studying a well-written textbook. Therefore, tilt against the trend of the times and pore over an old master like Gombrich!"

This new brilliant and luxury edition makes it the perfect way to illustrate a great classic."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists- men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful gift of balancing shapes and colours till they are 'right', and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work... But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.' (453-4) Sometimes I just need to read a textbook. History is underrated and I really needed to learn what is the big deal with Michelangelo. Or why art became abstract and I love it, but what makes it legit? I had picked up impressions here and there in my own foraging, but it is extremely satisfying to be able to put it together into a cohesive conversation and storyline. Albeit, that means this was a dense book to get through with so many artists and artworks but the author did a good job of not just making this a back catalogue of art. And pair this with my knack of barreling through books no matter how painful, I am happy to say I have finally finished this book!!!!! ;-) Gombrich's main thesis is that there is no ""Art"" but artists, which lends this book to a very thorough and robust history of not only artworks but philosophies and the human beings behind them. This is not just a book of information but a well-thought out story of Western art, both its technical aspects which is, of course, a very important foundation to the story, as well as the confluent history and philosophy behind it from prehistoric ages up to the 1950s (modern era). I think observing the changing trends of art and architecture is a great way to learn about world history and philosophical thought. The tone of the book did not give me a sense of propaganda, another positive from learning from a book and not the Internet; neither the conservatism that sees anything after the masters of the Renaissance as a deterioration or a progressivism that views ancient art as elitist or out-of-touch. I was most excited to get to the chapter, ""Break from Tradition"" with the Impressionists and the rest, because that's so close to my timeline! It was interesting to see how art moved from a ritual-related community medium, to a patron-mediated form for showing off mostly, to artists gaining notoriety and more freedom in the Renaissance, to the break from tradition and moving into a more subjective aim coming from the exhaustion of previously set rules that has to do with expressing pure emotion akin to what music does. How it moved from a concern for symbols and lessons (Medieval age) to realistic representation (Renaissance) to work that contains a sense of childlike wonder and spontaneity (which I would characterize the mind and emotion dichotomy). The impact of the Reformation on the art that developed in Italy v.s. Northern Europe and England. The move from idealized beauty in the Renaissance to the need to depict things exactly as they are in nature during Realism to spotlighting the disinherited and ugly in the modern era. In a technical sense, the summary of struggles can be described as the attempt to find balance between form and expressive pattern/color, and the desire to find a 'soul' in the art when it gets too bogged down by technique, rules, and gimmicks. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful postscript that was a sort of meta-commentary on his previous work and as it relates to even more contemporary times (at time of writing, 1965)- how we are prone to think of history, much less art history, to be a linear progression of 'better' works and if the public marginalized unconventional artists, today we are all too eager to praise anything that has a hint of change or novelty. A delicious digestivi to top off the 27-course meal. ""The artist or critic has no such clear-cut tests [as scientists do]. And yet he feels that it is no longer possible to ask for time to consider whether a new experiment makes sense or not."" (465) What struck me the most is how the story of art is really a constant conversation between artists and society, and how much of the artistic tradition was formed due to economic constraints from the relationship between artists and the public. For most of these artists, it was them working out their most personal and existential quandaries through the medium of art. This makes me ask my principal question from reading this book, which is, ""What kind of art would these artists have made if they were able to resolve their existential qualms and longings in their real lives, and let art be not an attempt to prove themselves, but a medium with which they can engage with peace? Some of the 'primitive' art that these modern European artists sought out had the 'expressiveness, clarity of structure, and simplicity of technique' (428). Did they tie themselves in knots over nothing?"" A.k.a. ""Did the West overthink?"" which is a valid question to ask most of the time since the Enlightenment maybe. Though, I wonder if that would make for boring history of art. I think the one artist who represents this as an example though is Rembrandt, who does not make his subject matter beautiful in an idealized way, but does not discard mastery of painting principles. My favorite artist was probably Picasso and my favorite artwork his little ceramic plate of the bird. Favorite painting was Whistler's Noctourne in Blue and Silver: Old Battersea Bridge. Raphael is a close second with his depiction of movement and balance of figures. I also appreciated the liveliness of Frans Hals' portrait of Pieter van der Broecke, Birds in a bush (from Egyptian tomb from the Middle Kingdom), Maiden gathering flowers (Wall-painting from 1st AD in Naples), Botticelli's Venus. Favorite moment was probably seeing how the West took from the East, especially Japanese woodblock and such and the reason why - they disregarded the rules of composition so long upheld by the academies. Or how Art Noveau was successful because it was based on the new possibilities for new material of iron and glass developing an ornamental style of its own (406). Or how modern artists are fascinated now by texture and are interested in multimedia works, between painting and sculpture. Or how new aims lead to new technologies, so Impressionism led to paints applied directly on the surface to obtain the reflections of light rather than premeditating a primary layer of paint. I also liked reading about the Egyptians and how they would represent each part of the body from the angle that showed its best feature which leads to its unique design. The juxtaposition of Northern Europe's focus on materials/details and Italy's focus on human forms. Cézanne and how he integrated the Impressionists' work with the past by finding a balance between 'strong, intense colours' and 'lucid patterns'... spontaneity but also clarity and order. I understood Baroque architecture more, how it is irregularity brought together by its decorative elements to make a cohesive, unified whole (v.s. Renaissance architecture which is inspired by the Classical era, much more elegant and simple, and composed or repeating, atomic, self-sufficient parts). I want to read more about art in the East and the impact of Eastern philosophy, as art and society found a strong draw toward it in the desire for spontaneity. In strange tangents, this book made me hopeful because there were a couple examples of artists who are known in the canon who was able to create because they had an independent source of income and used their leisure time to create art. I love suffering artists but I'm all for breaking the myth."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I received this book from a very good friend of mine after having a conversation in which I showed little admiration for art critics, and for the power forces that determine what is relevant and what is not relevant in the arts. This personal opinion probably arises from the fact that I do art that has no commercial value. While my friend didn’t intend to show me why I was right or wrong in my opinion, he thought it would be interesting for me to read what someone who had spent his life studying had to say about that particular subject. The book is an amazing journey through major events in Western Art (he basically ignores Oriental achievements such as Chinese calligraphy or Tibetan sand mandalas). It shows, with a fair amount of excellently chosen examples, how artists have faced and solved problems (problems of shape, space, color, ideas, constructions) throughout history, and the answers or conclusions they have arrived to. The author does an excellent job in trying to make all these examples work together, showing how one painting can be see as an improvement (or better, a succession) to another painting previously exposed in the book. This makes all the paintings displayed on this book have a connection with each other, giving the reader a better understanding of the whole. As many people, I have always wondered why some artists have been more relevant than others. I think few people cannot be shocked to see that a Rothko or a late work by Picasso can be sold for much more money than a painting by Ilya Repin, or by John Singer Seargent. This book makes great attempt to explain, almost objectively, the importance of paintings such as the Mona Lisa (introducing the revolutionary technique of sfumato), or of artists such as Willem Kalf (changing people and landscapes for vases and bread as his main subject study). It was very pleasing to understand why artists like Giotto, Van Eyck, Rubens, or Raphael have the status they have. I think that Gombrich has produced an excellent work that might serve as an introduction, or guide, to any particular style, epoch, or artist in which the reader is interested."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is not a breezy book. Art, as I had always encountered it, was always rather stuffy and rather incomprehensible, and that was kind of okay? Like, I didn't mind not getting it because Art and I Were Just Not That Close. The funny thing is that this book seriously puts you *there* with art, it tells you all the context you need to know to not feel like art is something people bullshit you about with long-winded commentaries or that you look at a museum and say 'Yeeeep yep yep yep. A.. picture. Indeed.' This books makes everything a lot easier to grasp, makes the developments in art make sense and helps you see why it all has value, how it all strives to solve problems or, in it's own way, to be useful. I really like the way it makes the assertion that art is 'contemplative' so incomplete. Sure, art is contemplative, but it definitely had a use, was *meant* for something, and later on, was a medium through which artists explored problems of technique, not just like, splattered paint on a canvas or crazy lines for no reason. In the end I can't say I can appreciate art more, because I definitely still have a lot of problems looking at art by myself ('yeeep yep yep yep... art indeed') BUT the book helped me understand art history a lot better, and how it was shaped by its time and how and why it changes. That definitely goes a long way. The narrative is quite engaging and clear. I agree with other comments here that it definitely suffers a bit from the time it was written (it's rather condescending to 'primitives' and rather racist, and this is not about World Art so much as Europe-US art) but for one that's just starting to dabble in art history, this is definitely a clarifying and eye opening read."

The Story of Art is a chronicle of art history from its origins in ancient cave paintings to the Post-Modernism of the later twentieth century. While a product of his time (Gombrich spends the vast majority of the book on male European artists) Gombrich can at times be surprisingly progressive in his recognition of the value of non-European and folk art, and his love of and dedication to the subject of art history shines through every page. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves art and has a lot of time on their hands."

""Art"" in the modern sense, esp after the impressionists is a relatively recent phenomenon, in which an artist has transitioned from being a craftsman (like a cobbler or a mason, indeed a person barely respected by the nobility) to a liberated creative (like a poet) through the intervening age of the Renaissance. The book is massive in its coverage and covers art right from the Greeks till the 1950s in about 500 pages and yet manages to deliver insight beyond barely naming the artists and techniques (in fact he shuns all jargon and that's a huge advantage for non-experts) although admittedly he is partial to the medieval and Renaissance era and is mainly confined to European art."

The very title itself, then, testifies to the Euro-American-centric/colonialist attitudes of the times in which this was produced—but the faults of the book remain apparent even after overlooking this. Severely marred by Gombrich's several unfounded prejudices (case in point: that ""Constable's path... achieved something of more lasting importance"" than Turner's) that find absolutely no correspondence in reality; even more aggravating is his attempt to offer these partial judgments as fact/objective observation—which I find to be academically and intellectually dishonest."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The book tells the history of art with a mellifluous language in a story-like fashion. Reading it had a significant effect on my views on concepts like ""renaissance"", ""baroque"", ""french revolution"" etc. Probably the most shocking one has been that the author relates the birth of renaissance to the artist's struggle to make the public accept his profession as one beyond a handcraft. At school, we were taught that there were much more ""elevated"" reasons behind such big changes in the progress of the mankind."

They make me feel better in the moment, but ultimately don't do much towards building a full picture of happiness. The inherent problem in any book that's a how-to for something artistic, whether it be writing or painting or making music or the artistry in tailoring a custom Voltron costume, the problem with the how-to book is that when you're reading the how-to book you're not doing the actual thing you're being taught to do. In other words, a book ABOUT writing is probably less helpful to a writer than a book that's just plain good. A how-to book about painting is probably of less use than a book of paintings you enjoy. I'm not saying there's no place for these types of books, and this one is smart because it's a quick read and it sticks pretty well to the motivational side of things as opposed to the nuts and bolts. It's good to read motivational stuff, especially because creating art can be a pretty lonely process. It's just hard to pack away the awareness that while you're reading about creating art, you could spend that time creating art."

It's a quick read that you can finish in one sitting, but the ideas and advice it contains will stay with you long after you've put it down. Some of Austin's suggestions will validate what you're already doing, some will challenge you to fundamentally change a creative practice, others will inspire you to grab a notebook and get to work immediately. Because it's such a small and accessible book, you'll want to go back to it from time to time. Just like Stephen King's , as you change and grow as an artist, it reveals new ideas and inspirations to you that you may have missed on a previous read. This is a fantastic addition to your library, and a wonderful gift for any creative person in your life."

Here are the Top Ten Points that the author makes in this teeny book: 1. Steal like an artist 2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started 3. Write the book you want to read 4. Use your hands 5. Side projects and hobbies are important 6. Do good work and share it with people 7. Geography is no longer our master 8. Be nice (the world is a small town) 9. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done) 10. Creativity is subtraction It's all very good advice. It's all great reminders. But that's what these are - reminders. The beef I have with self-help or how-to books is that the information inside the covers is stuff you already know. You just haven't thought about it before. This isn't to say that these books aren't helpful for many - but for people who are too busy (or, in extreme cases, too lazy) to think for themselves. They can read the books and their third eye can open and they can think they've just broke new ground... and then they don't go off to do what it is they were learning how-to do. What is good about Kleon's book is that he acknowledges almost immediately that there is no such thing as originality. Had he not written that very early on I'd be calling him a hypocrite right now for trying to pass any of this off as original. But that wasn't his intention - he saw a market for his advice and he went with it, so I give him props for that. It's just that I'm such a cynical person anyway, I'm wary of these sorts of ""guides"". I'd much rather a person just muddle through on their own based on their own experiences, learning from all the good and the bad that happens, and creating something out of all of that. This is a Hot Topic sort of creativity - mass marketed, polished, packaged. So why did I read it? Great question, because this is not at all my thing. I was curious, primarily. I came across his name because I came across someone's blog where the author was writing about her journal, which led to her discussion of Kleon's log books, and I was curious to see what he could possibly say about creativity. That's One. Two: I'm fascinated by the creative process. What works for me and my creativity is going to be completely different from my boyfriend's creative process, or my best friend's creative process, or the stranger down the street. I like reading about the daily process that my favorite writers/musicians/artists/people to get into their creative groove because it's fascinating, not because I want to copy them (though Kleon recommends a lot of copying; and this isn't to say there's anything wrong with it, per se, but it's not my motivation). The information here isn't necessary for the stuff people generally consider ""creative"" - some of stuff is helpful just in your daily life. People think a 9-to-5 job is energy-sapping and you can't be creative in your boring white-collar job, and those people sit back and do... well, very little of anything... and judge the rest of us who have to work for what we want and say we're not creative. I am creative in my job as much as possible and on paper it's not a very creative position. I have to be creative to find ways of being creative. And when it works, it works well, and it comes up in my annual reviews regularly, so I'm occasionally doing something right. This book is a good reminder for people in those positions too, who think they aren't in any position to be creative. Don't get all stuck on what you or are not doing, don't compare yourself to other people. (That's not even a part of Kleon's advice. That one comes from me. And a bunch of other people.) The part I like the best is #5. Hobbies important. I always have a side project of some sort, but I have yet to figure out how to consistently have energy after my stupid 9-to-5 job (actually it's a 7-something-to-4-something job, but that's beside the point). I was hoping for some insight from Kleon on that, but it wasn't really there. He basically just said ""Hey, you can do this!"" which, yeah, okay, thanks, I tell myself that every day, but I'm still tired and sapped. Probably from all that creativity I do at work - coming up with ways not to kill people or worry about backstabbing takes a crapload of energy and creativity. So, again, great reminders here, and really great for Millennials and Gen Y and whatever generation comes after those kids (have they been named yet??). It's a fast read, hopefully inspiring, even if for just the moment. But don't get bogged down by it. Read it because it's fast and easy, feel good for a few, and then go on and do your thing. Do . That's all you can answer to regularly anyway. The other thing I fully 100-bajillion% agree with Kleon about - keep a journal. Do whatever you want in those pages, but keep thing. If you want to be creative in any way, that's going to be your rock. I fill mine with everything. EVERYTHING. You could flip through them, but you'd think I am a serial killer. I mean it's all very insane in these journals. (And I would have to kill you after you flipped through them, so.) But that's what works for me. Figure out what works for you and do that. You'll appreciate it later. A little heavy-handed with all the quotes, but again, feels more geared towards younger readers anyway, and hopefully many readers will want to know more about those quoted people which is certainly Kleon's point. And on that note (I can quote too!), I'll share one of my favorites from David Foster Wallace's :"

Given that I'm not an artist - I wasn't seeking 'words- of -wisdom'. This book just landed in my hands - and I couldn't resist reading it. Austin says ""every artist gets asked the question, ""where do you get your ideas?"" Austin says....'The honest artist answers', ""I steal them""...... ............as in RIPS THEM OFF? Perhaps a more 'kind' way to answer the question --- is an artist draws inspiration from others. But what do I know. I'm not an artist. This little book is filled with fun engaging anecdotes.....with a list of 10 things to do to unlock our creativity. #9 is BE BORING!!! I've got that one down!!! I'm a master of boring!!!......but creative? I have my doubts! He recommended 10 books we should read: I've only read 1 on his list. ""Bird by Bird"". By Anne Lamott. -- Proof: I AM NOT CREATIVE?/! But..... Austin listed THINGS WE MUST DO: Take a walk --- works for me!!! Start your swipe file --- What the hell is a swipe file? Go to the library --- I DO! Buy a notebook and use it ----Done! Get yourself a Calendar ----Done! Start your logbook---For what? Give a copy of this book away-----More sales for Austin Kleon - ok - I'm willing! Start a blog --- You've got to be kidding: Goodreads takes enough time. Take a nap!!!!!!! ---- Favorite advice in the book!!! This is a great book to read 'while' being lazy - boring - sleepy - in your pj's -when you need something 'little & lightweight' to hold in your hands!"

Yeah, probably because they thought you already knew them. This book is packed to the brim with platitudes such as: try to do good work, there are lots of different things to consider when choosing a place to live, it's important to be careful who you marry, money is really important, try to find a day job that you like and, my favorite, take $10 to the stationers and buy some stuff - then you can write your ideas down. Genius. The contradictions here are irritating also. He says that computers are soul suckers and time wasters and then says that it's great to create blogs and that it's important to have an online community of friends, he says ignore your critics and then recommends keeping a praise file to use at times of insecurity. It's all a little weird. It's not that I disagree with the guy, although he has a few ideas that seem strange to me, it's just that everything here is so bland that I wonder what the purpose of this book is, except that it might have something to do with 'money being really important' to the author. Maybe the main title of the book should read 'Steal Like An Artist...from gullible readers'."

The audience was a mix of young artists trying to make their way, fans of the artist, and amateur art enthusiasts just there for the experience. While offering words of wisdom to the young artists in the crowd, he said: “every day you have to wake up in the morning and tell yourself a story, even if it’s bullshit.” He was referring to the dark voice that talks to artists who haven’t made it big yet. Writers and musicians have that dark voice also. It’s that dark voice that whispers into your ear at night and tells you that your work isn’t good enough. That dark voice that tells you someone has already made something like this before. That dark voice that tells you, you’re a fraud. That dark voice that tells you that you can’t be like your favorite author. That dark voice that tells you that you’d rather be watching Netflix than writing. That dark voice that whispers “no one wants to read this shit”. This book is for writers, artists, and musicians. This book is the “bullshit” you have to tell yourself. This book is the middle finger to that dark voice that creeps into your subconscious."

Austin Kleon writes in an easy-to-follow style, instructing readers about how to be creative without talking down to anyone. In fact while I read the book, I felt like I was part of some secret creators club, with this book as the secret club manual. The book focuses on 10 rules for people to follow in order to be creative. Rule number one is ""Steal like an artist."" The other nine are printed on the back of the book, but simply knowing the rules does not give you an edge in creativity. You need the explanations, the stories, the logic behind the rules that Mr. Kleon provides to get that tingly feeling (figuratively speaking, of course). I recommend this book for anyone over the age of 10, anyone who loves to create but feels stifled in today's world, anyone who loves to think, and anyone doing anything at all creative."

While I appreciate the premise — draw inspiration from people you admire and surround yourself with good role models — I'm uneasy with the ""steal"" concept. The title grabs attention, but I think it overshadows the actual point, which is not to become a replica of someone else but to create more authentic work by creating work you love. It's a bit overly simplistic, and definitely a short, fast read. For those who stand on the precipice, afraid to answer the call of creative spirit, it will serve as a ""soft entry"" to better books, like Anne Lammott's ""Bird by Bird,"" Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" and Julia Cameron's ""The Sound of Paper."" For tired, disillusioned creatives, it may also reinvigorate. Those in the thick of creating will probably want something meatier. Reading Kleon's book, I can see some of his influences, particularly a heavy nod toward bloggers-cum-authors like Seth Godin and Hugh MacLeod. I also drink the Kool-Aid offered by Godin, MacLeod, Johnny B. Truant, Brian Clark of Copyblogger, Chris Guillebeau of The Art of Non-Conformity, and others. I like them all and find inspiration often in their words. But if you're young and impressionable, if you are on the edge of your art and not fully-formed, it's easy to miss the deeper points they make. It's easy to miss the parts where they say it's hard and often sucks and sometimes seems pointless and sometimes is a colossal failure. Their passion for what they do is so charismatic that it's easy to get swept away, missing the part where they learned — through trial, error, mentors or schooling — how to market themselves effectively, how to manage money, how to lose the ""romance"" of being an artist and still find pleasure when the passion grows cool. It's not enough to love what you do. Perhaps that sounds harsh, perhaps it's a cynical, jaded worldview. It's tempered by experience. Loving your craft is fine if you want it to be a hobby. But if you want to keep a roof over your head with the work you produce, if you want to make a living at it until the end of your days, love will not keep you alive. I worry for the writers, journalists and photographers who load up on humanities courses in college, the ones who believe suffering for your craft is noble — or eventually successful. Please, please, creative types ... take a few business classes. Maintain a broad skill set. Don't tangle your identity up in your art or your profession, because if anything takes those away, you will be left rootless, drifting, and the road to recovery will be very, very hard. I know I sound jaded and bitter. I'm not at all. I'm still passionate about what I do. But that passion is tempered by the pesky ""reality thing"" I always preferred to ignore. I never wanted to be bothered by the ""boring"" things like money, accounting, contracts, marketing. But these are the things that provide the income to keep DOING your art. If you're going to steal like an artist, steal the business sense they bring to the table as well. I promise, you will never regret the time you spend learning the mechanics behind the career. With any luck, it will enable you until the end of your days to create wonderful things only you can bring to the world. Starving artists living in garrets can produce great work. But smart artists will find the road so much easier and equally as fulfilling."

I also like the fact that his book titles sound like a click bait but after reading them you will realize that they are accurate. The book does not encourage stealing or plagiarism and I found out that I have been stealing like an artist for a long period of time, the point is that most things have been done or said so you take a bit from everywhere, add your own touch and voila, you are a new artist now! The book had many great quotes from many different people! I have been applying this in medicine, in school, in reviews and in almost everything I do. The book is easy to read, uses drawings and bullet points which makes it fun!

Many things are just rehashed stuff from elsewhere. And steal? Like an artist? Yeah, there are lots of controvercies and the plagiaristic hearings are among the most unclear and pointless ones, I say. Still, ouch. And steal?? Some of us steal inspiration from sun, rehash Picasso, get the energy to do wonderful staff brom bipolar disorder and technique from schisophrenia, and yeah, it's totally all right to do any of that. Some don't. Many don't. Still, it's all right to flip through someone else's work to try and get new things done, things that haven't yet been done. Just don't steal literally, it's not nice.

The post was basically one man’s manifesto when it came to creativity. He listed out ten things he wished he knew when he was starting out as a writer and artist. I remember the simplicity of his statements — practical, to the point — but also incredibly insightful. Small things we often forget when we are knee-deep in The Creating or overwhelmed by The Doubts. I remember nodding my head in agreement to nearly everything in that blog post, and then just the other day, while I was at B&N, I saw his book on the shelf. That blog post (by Austin Kleon) has been turned into a lovely little book: Steal Like an Artist. I bought it, took it home, read it in under an hour, and experienced the euphoria I had reading the original blog post all over again. I wanted to jump up and shout, “Yes! This! Exactly this!” This book is a little piece of genius and I think that Every. Single. Person. leading a creative life ought to read it. Or at least flip through a couple pages. Why? Let me give you a sampling. The book opens with a quote from Pablo Picasso –”Art is theft.” — and then goes on to discuss how nothing is truly original. How every idea is simply a re-imagining of previous works. Kleon says: Oh my goodness, yes! Nothing is new. Everything is borrowed and expanded upon. From here, the idea of “stealing” is introduced. And not stealing as in plagiarizing. That is bad. BAD! Plagiarizing is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Kleon instead talks about “copying” as a method of practice, as a way of finding yourself. He talks about surrounding yourself with the work of the artists you love, and the work of the artists those artists love, and studying everything. Embrace those artists. Emulate them. Try to create not only as they create, but to see as they see. Get inside their minds. The goal of copying is to see the ways in which you can’t be those artists because they are them and you are you. Kleon says this much better than me: And then Kleon gives the most basic advice: Start making stuff. Just start! He talks about how “imposter syndrome” often holds people back. (I know for a fact that I struggle with this daily.) So what is “imposter syndrome?” YES! It’s like he’s in my head. I do feel like a phony, a hack, a sad excuse for a writer. I don’t know what I’m doing, and that’s OK. No one does. Every writer face doubts and fears. They sit down and create without knowing the answers — from the NYT Bestselling author, to the child picking up a pencil to draft their very first story. The rest of the book became a sort of surreal reading experience for me, where I felt like Kleon was sitting in my office, speaking directly to me. Everything I need to hear when I’m lost in revisions or slogging through a first draft or swimming in the Vortex of Self-Doubt and Loathing for any number of reasons was in this book. Sometimes these words of encouragement were written: And then there were the doodles — you can see a bunch more — interspersed between all the brilliance: While I’ve summarized the book in this post, it’s nothing like the actual experience of reading it. Between the simple statements, sketched visuals, and conversational tone, it’s almost as if Kleon is speaking directly to you. This book is honest. And beautiful. And real. And it’s just good advice. For a creative life, but for life in general. But of course, as Kleon points out on the very last page: Isn’t that the truth? Originally reviewed ."

Really?! What were you expecting? Do you want the author to write you your new novel, grant application, play? Should he wipe your ass too, while he is at it? Get to it. Stop complaining. This isn’t a technical manual or a blueprint for idea. This book does, in my opinion, exactly what it claims to do – no more, no less. Inspirational, a good reminder that the walls we put up around ourselves in the creative domain can be torn down and erected at will. A couple of my favourite quotes:"

This is a wonderful little book with advice on creativity that makes you think. I'm pretty sure i didn't grasp the whole thing right now. I think i'll take a few things out of it. And in a few months I might read it again (really only takes like 30 minutes) and take a few more things out of it. It's nicely written, it's got some nice napkin-sketches in there so it stays a light read. And it also makes me very curious about the authors poetry book . So aye, he's smart! Ouch. This one kind of hit home. Although i do always plan to read the books i buy (almost) straight away, it just never ends up that way. But it's true though, my library reminds me that the world is full of undiscovered territories and opportunities. I like that! Having bookshelves with only 'read' books would be quite boring, no? I find this actually true. To be effective and productive i often immediately start working on my pc (whatever it is: ideas, presentations...) and at one point i'm typically stuck. I take a piece of paper and i start writing random ideas on there. Drawings things, with lots of arrows. And somehow the ones that went through the random paper process always end up being better, much better. I figure i'll immediately start on paper as of now. See? this one is the best advice of all. And so true. I actually didn't need this book to tell me this, I already know. I never get good ideas when on a deadline or when I'm busy-busy-busy. The best work I do is when i think i'm just fiddling around. And yet somehow my bosses insist on piling work on top of work on top of work. Maybe i should tell to read this book!"

At a slim 100-something pages, it is a fast engaging read, filled with doodles and quotes and functioning the way zines your internet friend would send you. I say this because it is the equivalent of a whole body approach to creativity as opposed to the spot treatment of fixing one specific area of your art, whatever your medium may be; to put it simply, it's seeing the forest for the trees. Kleon encourages living a creative life in which you make and play while allowing yourself opportunity to work and grow at your own pace. Creativity is less about what you make than the process it took to get you there. You might not even end up making what you intended when you began but you will make something and you will find yourself in the process. Highly recommended for the overly stimulated, easily hopeless creative minds."

You'll either find the answer or you'll come up with a better question."" And on the next page: ""Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away. Nothing is more important than an unread library."" Maybe it's just me, but this rubbed me the wrong way. Google is not the answer to everything.

I really like his style of writing and his motivated thoughts and the drawings as well. Reading this book brought me the same feeling as enjoying a delicious piece of chocolate cake; it is brief, simple, deep and amusing! But what I like the most about this book is its writer's creativity and his boundless imagination, this is the kind of books that breaks the stereotypes and replace them by originative ideas. I took some useful notes instead of rereading the book: 💡You are not bound to create something original because the word original literally doesn't exist ,so free yourself from the burden of being original and embrace influence instead of running from it. 💡Just as you have a familial genealogy , you also have a genealogy of ideas. 💡The books we read and people we are surrounded with and friends we pick determine our vision and the quality of our ideas because we are a mashup of what we opt in our life. 💡Be aware of the ideas you collect and the people you deal with because we will be influenced by them indirectly. 💡Be curious about anything and everything and get your own education don't wait for school to teach you. 💡 Be a genuine nerd, google everything; you may find the answer to your question or you will get a better question. 💡Jot any thought comes to your mind, and copy useful quotes from the books you read and even record overheard conversation! then collect them in a ""swipe file"". 💡Making things paves the way to explore yourself and your capacities but the reverse is incorrect. 💡 Glenn o'Brien said: ""start out as a phony and became real"" thats means pretend you are a successful person until you can achieve it , or fake that you are doing something you want until you can really make it. 💡Observe successful people and start to mimic their style of thinking and doing things, don't just emulate theirs looks from outside but their way of looking at the world. 💡In any field you are intrested in do your work the way you want to see it done . 💡Find a way to bring your body into your work; use your hands intead of just staying in front of your computer; share your hands in the work of your brain. 💡Be an expert of the productive procrastination by doing more than one project at once , move from one to another when you fell broed until you finish them all. 💡Having a hobby is really helpful for your career and your spirit. 💡Share a little glimpse of your process with people. 💡Get rid of social media for a while, isolate yourself from people, pick up a book and enjoy your own company . 💡Be nice to everybody and ignore your enemies to vanquish them. 💡Surround yourself with positive people , and pay attention to the ideas and the quality of thoughts you are influenced by in the social media. 💡Make friendships and be helpful to talented people . 💡Whatever your work is, keeping a file of praise that you heard or read from people who appreciate your work is a wonderful boost when you need the lift. 💡Save your energy and your money as much as you can . 💡You really need a calender to organize your work and a logbook to tackle your progress. 💡Creativity should be restricted or related by limitations or less potentials to be revealed. In the end he adds some suggestions of useful books as Egnore Everybody by Hugh Macleod, Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud and Make a World by Ed Emberley. The book is pretty easy to read and very enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone :)."

It is full of what I consider basic, sensible advice for creatives and people looking to practice creativity in their daily lives. Although I would consider the ideas presented merely suggestions because you know what, just do what works for you. There is absolutely no perfect template for creation. Kleon touches on several things like ""imposter syndrome"" that affects a lot of artists, no matter their level. Hehe, hard not to relate! I see it with a lot of my friends too, just the other day one of my favorite, incredibly successful friends was talking about this! We're all just figuring it out as we go along. Imo one of the potential good things about this feeling is it forces you to challenge yourself, to keep trying to evolve beyond where you are and what you are currently creating. Some of the key things he mentions which I try and practice: do anything you can to carve 0ut time to do your creative work. Build a schedule. Maintaining a discipline is important. Do not be afraid to be influenced by artists you admire. Look at and study their work. Even if you start off by imitating, you practice long enough you will generally end up making it your own. That said, always have to be careful not to just blindly copy or follow rote patterns. Although I do think copying is a great practice tool allowing you to reverse-engineer and learn other peoples' problem-solving methods. I do quite a bit of digital work but I also agree with his view on computers. Having a glass screen in front of you is stultifying in certain ways. I always work with physical materials to start projects, the possibilities seem more limitless with those materials. Once the work has gotten to the point of being on the computer the endpoint is more-defined, the work is more tracked, and an element of perfectionism can creep in (partly because it is so easy to constantly erase). This is merely how it works and feels for me, I'm sure it might be different for others. The other book in this vein that I'm planning on reading is Twyla Tharpe's The Creative Habit. Heard it was good, from what I understand one of its main points of emphasis is the discipline required to consistently create."

Definitely worth keeping on your bedside table or work desk if you're an artist of any kind (writer, musician, dancer, etc). Probably the piece that stuck out the most for me was Kleon's discussion of constraints. I've known that putting constraints on, say, a piece of writing - putting a box around what I was trying to create - actually made the piece better and, strangely enough, made me feel more free. It was refreshing to hear this bit of advice from someone else. And that's really why this book is great. Kleon takes the things artists know but rarely articulate and he articulates them. Really a book to keep on hand whenever you're feeling stuck."

In other words we are all creative, aren't we? According to Austin Kleon, when people give you advice, they're actually talking to themselves in the past. So this book is him talking to a previous version of himself. You can finish this book in less than two hours, but don't do that. Take your own time, if you have read something which you found interesting, ponder over it, one thing may lead to another. For example the writer says that we don't get to pick our family, but we can pick our teachers and we can pick our friends and we can pick the music we listen to and we can pick the movies we see. I wrote this in my note book and tried to analyze it. I felt that we can't get to choose our family or our relatives. It means that we are what we are because of our friends we choose and the most important the books we read. I sometimes think where I would be if it were not for the books I read. That's one habit which has helped me the most. Now I'd like to share some of my favorite quotes from the book: 1.We are shaped and fashioned by what we love. 2.The artists is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference. Hoarder collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. 3.School is one thing. Education is another. The two don't always overlap. Whether you're in school or not, it's always your job to get yourself an education. 4.Fake it till you make it. In Hindi we say, ""nakal karte karte akal aajatee hey."" 5.The best advice is not to write what you know, it's to write what you like. 6.Work that only comes from the head isn't good. Watch a great musician play a show. Watch a great leader give a speech. You'll see what I mean. 7.Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I'm bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts - it's so boring, I always get good ideas. If you're out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall as long as you can. As the artists Maira Kalman says,""Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind. 8. You don't put yourself online only because you have something to say - you can put yourself online to find something to say. The Internet can be more than just resting place to publish your finished ideas - it can also be an incubator for ideas that aren't fully formed, a birthing center for developing work that you haven't started yet. 9.If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room. 10.It takes a lot of energy to be creative. You don't have the energy if you waste it on other stuff. 11. In the end, creativity isn't the just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely. And have fun."

Kahn and Vint Cerf create the Internet?” on Quora where he wrote that it was a cumulative effort of generations : ""Of course, our work benefited from the predecessor network: the ARPANET, and the work of many others who invented the transistor, the computer, time-sharing, packet switching, multiple programming languages, and a long list of other things. Things on the scale of the Internet are the product of vast numbers of contributors."" Steal Like an artist echoes this idea. Any great creative work is influenced by some source or the other. The book tells you to go ahead and start making the art instead of waiting for the eureka moment. ""Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started. If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. You’re ready. Start making stuff."" I believe this principle is not limited to artists. After all any work if done passionately, becomes a piece of art to its creator, irrespective of whether it has been done on a drawing board or a breadboard."

Author Austin Kleon points out that no artist's work is ever completely original, and that trying to be completely original will daunt an artist and eventually smother her/his creativity. He suggests artists embrace the inevitability of influence, celebrate living outside of a vacuum, relax, and have fun with their art. Beyond that, he offers tips on how to stay focused, upbeat, and receptive to incoming inspiration. True to its subject, this book features an abundance of quotes and tips from artists who aren't the author. I like that. Instead of this book feeling like one guy talking about what works for him, it seems more like a panel of successful artists sharing their processes (which also happen to work for the one guy). Advice I like in particular: - Every night, before going to sleep, think about one thing that made you happy that day. - Jerry Seinfeld's calendar idea: keep a year-at-a-glance calendar, and every day that you do everything you were supposed to, mark an X on the calendar. See how long you can get a row of Xs."

This book was okay... This book was an extremely short read. I read it in around forty-five minutes. It is filled with advice, quotes, illustrations, and newspaper blackout poems. This book had some great advice. I wrote down some of these tips because I think they'd be helpful to practice, but this book has some extreme pacing issues. You'd be reading some great writing advice, and then, two pages of random quotes and newspaper blackout poems shoved right in between a paragraph. I was confused on whether I was to skip the random inserts, finish reading the advice, and then come back to read the inserts, or if I was to read the inserts and then continue onto the advice. But either way, this really broke the immersion for me. The thing with self-help is that it makes you feel productive and inspired reading these books, but then if you don't take and use such advice, it's rather pointless. A lot of these books claim that if you buy said book, you'll do with your life, and , and as well. It's easy to get caught in a loop of buying and consuming these books, whilst it has no effect on your actual life. That's why, oftentimes, I don't rate these books as highly as other people. There are some genuinely good advice and practices in this book. It is annoying to deal with all the inserted material, but overall it was decently enjoyable. Definitely re-readable. This one was okay, but I couldn't recommend his other short self-help books. They were so tedious and repetitive to get through, that I just couldn't bring me to finish them, despite their short lengths."

I'm feeling now I really didn't need to buy a book with the phrase ""10 things nobody told you about being creative"" on the cover, because I've already told myself nearly all of it. The other parts I didn't really consider were either contradictory of themselves or would in no way relate to how I do things inside my creative process. ""Get really bored"" for example. For real? As a creative type I can't *stand* to get bored. I'm not going to take time from my day to sit down and TRY to become bored in order to get some inspiration; I'm going to go out and look at things. Engage! Kick start my brain; not put it in neutral. And his section of advice called ""Marry Well""? Puh. If we're to a comfortable enough point in life to consider marriage, the partner already knows what it's like to be with a creative person. We (artists) aren't going to go out ""shopping"" for a significant other and stress Kleon's bullets of what they'd be getting themselves into before working out a deal. Congrats to you, Austin Kleon, for finding a wife that will feed you, clean up after you and motivate you. Some of us are busy doing all of that for others while we're still trying to be artists. I also very much dislike how much ""steal"" is stressed in this book, & made to sound normal and perfectly acceptable. I worked in a graphics department once and nearly every designer there stole the foundation for their work from Pinterest. IT DROVE ME UP THE WALL. Use your own mind! There is a difference between being original and mimicking someone else's work. I'm not sure how you can be proud of something-- or even call it your creation-- when it originated from someone else's efforts. Sigh. Please don't pay full price for this book, or even buy it new. Borrow a copy from somewhere and give it straight back."

With a title like that, I wanted to read a book about stealing ideas to boost your creativity as an artist. The book was a little bit about that, but mostly it was about being organized, managing your money well, and living a happy life. Nothing wrong with that. I liked this book, but there was very little ground-breaking or unusual here. Yes, he's encouraging us to put together various ideas (stolen from others) and package it as your own new and unique thing, and yes, this book is an example of that. But I don't think that the way he put everything together amounted to anything terribly special. Meanwhile, the marketing is pretty good because: I don't often buy random books, but for some reason I spied this at the bookstore and decided to buy it. So I've got to give the author (or maybe his publisher?) credit for that! But I wouldn't recommend others to buy it full price like I did, because all in all, the book is rather ""ho-hum.""

I find it so helpful and relatable. I always thought to be original and I've to think everything out of nowhere. And this limitation of 100% originality directs us to frequently click backspace. The author not at all encouraged plagiarism but she asked us to copy and copy as she quote Yohji Yamamoto; “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy, you will find yourself.” This is an excellent piece of advice *_* ‘Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.’ The author told her readers to surround themselves with the best books, talented people and copy our ideals. As she quotes the German writer Goethe “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” “It is our failure to become our perceived ideals that ultimately define us and make us unique.” Did everything come from already present things? Nice :) “What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere.” A unique and out-of-the-box read for me and I like it. Excited to read more of Austin's work!"

Kleon encourages a creative life: to take up some messy hobby not because it's going to make you money and make you famous, but simply to refresh and revitalize your own brain. And I think that fits with the life of a Christian rejoicing in being like our Creator-Father. Best thing about it? I was expecting a fairly short book that would take me a few days to get through--but Kleon's little volume is a 6x6 square of inspirational paragraphs and Sharpie illustrations.

And in the process, sacrificing your innate creative bent. Comprising all of 133 pages, half of which are compelling illustrations and headline quotes set in font size a wee bit shorter than an advertisement hoarding, “Steal Like An Artist” leaves you feeling ambivalent. The experience is akin to that of a diner whose initial astonishment at the sheer exotic array of options promised to him, is dampened by the subsequent realisation that every single choice is either a translated version of or a cleverly disguised synonym for cabbage. But extremely and ‘cruciferously’ healthy, nonetheless. Kleon’s principles are very simple. “Steal but do not plagiarise.” You can emulate Rembrandt if he is your cup of tea. But please do not reproduce a Rembrandt and pass it off as a ‘rebrand’ (Ok he does not say it in as many words, but you get the message). Better still as Kleon suggests, hang pictures of your inspirations at the place of your work. “They are like friendly ghosts. I can almost feel them pushing me forward as I’m hunched over my guest.” I must have hung my heroes upside down because neither the ghost of Orwell nor the spirit of Hemingway have displayed even a modicum of altruism and wholeheartedness in lending a hand to their worshipper. The one principle which appealed to me and made me sit up is the one involving a mix of both analog and digital tools. Arguing that remaining perpetually hunched over a laptop has drained the modern day man of his creativity, Kleon exhorts us to use our hands whether it be writing or playing an instrument or engaging in craft. I couldn’t agree more. Nothing satisfies me more than scribbling a poem , even if it is absolute balderdash or malarkey using my fountain pen. Yet another dollop of wisdom has to do with the mischief of Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Kleon urges us to “Google everything”. Just to make sure you understand both the Noun and the succeeding pronoun very clearly, he continues: “I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question”. So basically you have a choice of ending up either a Cyberchondriac or a Donald Trump (is there a difference?) and everyone in between. A fantastic piece of advice is to carry a notepad/notebook (not the ones that made Michael Dell and Bill Gates who they are) and a pen wherever you happen to go. When artists such as David Hockney and Arthur Russell can get their clothes tailored in such a manner so as to facilitate stuffing of scrap papers and notepads, what prevents you from doing the same? I have personally been the beneficiary of this practice. I make it a point to always carry a note pad and a pen, both in the hopes that I will meet Salma Hayek one day and get her autograph and (mind you it is not an “or” but a vehement “and”) be so inspired by events unfolding around me that it makes me whip up a masterpiece akin to that penned by Friedreich Hayek! I have scribbled down a plethora of notes while commuting in public conveyances and while waiting to board one too. A curious piece of wisdom involves “marrying well”. Kleon asserts that “it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who’s obsessed with a creative pursuit.” Maybe Roger Federer can confirm this fact. Or would it be Mrs. Federer who would be most well equipped to corroborate this statement? My unmarried status precludes me from either refuting or agreeing with this particular philosophy. Keeping your day job whilst still hustling over the weekends and during times spent away from your day job is a very sensible suggestion. Just so that there is no confusion between livelihood and irrational exuberance, Kleon warns his readers to clearly demarcate between a steady job and creative activities. However one needs to make it clear that the day job needs to be such that it doesn’t want to make you vomit. While on days I have experienced mild bouts of regurgitation, I am yet to reach the retching phase of my profession. Touch wood! Kleon ends his book by giving a list of a few more books to read. Some of his recommendations being, “What is It” by Lynda Barry; “The Gift” by Lewis Hyde; “reality Hunger” by David Shields; “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lamott (I can vouch for this book personally. An absolute masterpiece). Let me end here. I need to take down the uncooperative duo of Messrs. Orwell and Hemingway and replace them with Ms. Virginia Woolf and Mr. J.R.R.Tolkien.

Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anyone else - that’s how you’ll get ahead” ‘Where do you get your crazy ideas from’ - is always joked as one of the worst questions to ask entertainers. I’m not in any way artistic (nor an entertainer!) but I’m guessing that there’s a similar one for the artworld, and that it can sometimes be perceived as an attack on originality - are you the one true artist or can people dismiss your genius as blatant influence (“well you’re blatantly copying X from the classic Y genre so how is that even challenging the modern zeitgeist?!”). A book that throws these fears away and instead reminds that you being you and new is still innovative - be creative and inspired as and don’t be afraid! Also any book that quotes Rollins is always something I’m going to look into… Some of the many low level approaches I have taken to have some form of colourful or abstract creativity in my life: a portable printer during lockdown to diarise and decorate the house with easily; posh and trendy sets of coloured pens and pencils; different notebooks and a plethora of types of stationery including pencil pots and cases; iPad pencils (multiple!) for all the potential digital art and scribbles when a pen and paper aren’t close at hand; comedy and cute colouring books; unnecessarily personal detailed book reviews as a way of expressing where the book has taken me to mentally and I’ve felt… On a daily basis I choose to type and write as well as annotate printouts (the analog to digital back to analog loop), colour code, colour in notes, read and switch formats (for instance, as soon as I started reading and enjoying this library ebook version, I immediately bought the audiobook for myself, and looked to buy a print copy for the family!). Whilst easy to sneer at, is fan fiction a bad thing? Being a fan and expressing that through letters (which my father in law confessed to having done so just the week after I read this!). In a complete life metaphor it is about just filling blank space with the correct amount and knowing when to step back and announce that you’re satisfied and finished (often two very different feelings)… for the time being “When I get busy I get stupid…”"

At first, I said to myself, ""self, this is too obvious (just like this joke)."" But forty pages in, when I'd written down 5 quotes and drawn a few diagrams, I realized that sometimes the obvious is exactly what we need. This may not be new ground, but Kleon offers his advice in an entertaining manner, with a liberal dosing of quotes from famous people doled out along the way (my favorite, via Questlove: ""The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from.""). The central premise is that all art is theft, taken from somewhere else and filtered through the unique consciousness of the artist. And I love that I found it so pleasantly packaged, on a table ready for students to grab and devour (as soon as I return it). Too frequently we obsess over the proper citation of sources at the high school level. There is good reason for this. But students must also learn to repackage information in their own way, with their own spin. If I taught a comp or research methods class, I might make this required reading."

One: Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don't make excuses for not working - make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now. If you have two or three real passions, don't feel like you have to pick and choose between them. Don't discard. Keep all your passions in your life. So, basically, in summary: use whatever you have wherever you are, study the people you admire, get out of your comfort zone to go see the world out there for inspiration, explore all your passions and make 0 excuses about why you can't do the kind of art you want to do.

You have hit the nail on the head with your usual acuteness.""* There is nothing new under the sun. Creators are bound only to rework and reframe the same ideas and colors and sounds that generations have manipulated. Yet there is beauty in recognizing that collage of inspiration and a joyful hope in curating a collection of ideas to be repurposed and remade into something new and fresh. Kleon directs you to build on the mundane muse of life, to create in response to art (of any medium) that you enjoy, and to create what you would want to listen to/read/appreciate. Peppered with quotations, photos, and pen-and-ink drawings, it is a delivered in a light hand by a friendly artist sharing what worked best for him. And although I regretted its brevity because I so enjoyed the journey, I loved seeing the tidy and precise measure with which it was written. No thought is wasted, no concept is belabored, and Kleon trusts you to understand the basics and build with what you probably already know but may have needed reminding of. *Mr. Rochester to Jane in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte"

Though sometimes, imo, cliché is good. But when I find something like this, this idea of creativity and creative ethics & principles... I am mind blown despite the fact that some might argue that its not anything new, and to quote the book loosely, it isn't.

In other words, “novelty” refers to something that “I” know, but others do not."

My first drawing after reading just a few chapters, blew my mind away. It was a self-portrait and I could not believe that I had drawn it. After all, it takes months of practice not reading of a few chapters from a book to improve drawing, right? The downside is that you only learn to copy what you see in front of you. You don't learn how to use your drawing medium, nothing much about shadows, no anatomy, no perspective. The focus of the book is on portraits (Which the author rightly says is the hardest thing for artists and the most impressive). But once you're done with this book you must pickup some serious drawing book to improve, otherwise you will be stuck drawing nascent drawings (which you will enjoy neverthless :) ) I will definitely recommend this for those are just starting with their drawing. This book is helluva motivator! You'll see results quickly, but once done, move on!"

Part of the problem is that I become frustrated at how difficult it is to draw accurately and in proportion, and invariably put away my pencils and sketchbooks after a series of failures. And then, a year or two later, I try again, with a new how-to-draw book and vigor, only to repeat the process. Recently I unearthed my box of accumulated art supplies and drawing books, and noticed the orange spine of Betty Edwards . This is the most often recommended title for beginners. I recalled reading a bit of it years ago, and setting it aside because the exercises seemed rather complicated and required the use of tools. So, I decided to give it another try. I read it carefully from cover to cover before doing any drawing. Then, I ordered the recommended tools (these can be made inexpensively but I opted to just buy them from the author's website) and have been practicing these exercises ever since. Though much of information Edwards presents in her book isn't unique, the way she teaches it helped facilitate understanding for me in ways I never had before. My entire approach to drawing has changed dramatically and I finally feel like it is something I can eventually master. Edwards believes that drawing accurately is something can be taught, much like driving or learning a new language. Though some people will learn more quickly than others, most people can obtain a basic level of profiency through learning and practice. I don't know why I never thought about it like that before! Artistic talent is often though of as innate, but in reality it is a set of skills. Edwards contends that the only ""talent"" necessary for drawing is the ability to write legibly; if you can do that, you can learn to draw. Much of the beginning of the book sets forth Edwards' theory on neurology and how it affects the way we conceptualize drawing. Though most of this was written decades ago (the book has gone through several editions) and Edwards' theories about brain sided-ness have been disproven, a lot of her framework rings true. By necessity of language, people think symbolically - words represent objects. But, artists think visually and this is what she teaches - how to think and see like an artist. For example, if I were attempting to draw a lamp, Edward would suggest that I stop thinking of it as a lamp. It is a series of basic shapes that are connected to each other in various proportions. So, I would try to see the lamp as a partly a square connected to a cylinder, an oval, etc. By seeing objects as a sum of shapes, a beginning artist can resist the temptation to draw her own concept of what that object should look like. Edwards believes that this tendency to revert to symbolic thinking is what hampers beginning artist. She illustrates this concept brilliantly in a fascinating early chapter about children's drawings, showing how almost universally, children adopt symbols representative of what they wish to draw. Heads are circles, smiles are elongated ""U""s. Once this pattern gets set cognitively, it's difficult to draw a head that isn't a circle. And heads are not circles! Edwards takes the reader through a series of exercises to show how much we tend to draw symbolically. In one exercise, a line drawing of a seated man is flipped upside down and we are instructed to draw it. It forces us to draw visually, as our brain doesn't process upside-down drawings as symbols. I remember drawing the circles of the man's glasses, not even realizing what they were! Most people will draw the upside-down image than the right-side up image. Each subsequent chapter introduces various accuracy skills: sighting, scaling, etc. She employs time honored tools such as picture planes to assist the beginner in seeing their subjects visually. Later chapters address drawing faces and using color. But I am really happy that I re-read this book and dived into its challenges. Thanks to Betty Edwards for teaching so many people that they can learn to draw. Postscript: As a person with a debilitating disabling illness, drawing is a bit of a challenge. I've found ways to work around some of the things that prevented me from trying (again). First, I made a place for my drawing materials where they could be easily accessible, and easily stored away: a nightstand drawer. I draw in a reclined position, with my sketchbook propped up on my knees, so I am comfortable. Some of the exercises require an hour or more of work; these I break up into smaller sessions, and I amend some of the suggested subjects if they are not suitable to my arrangement."

He wasn’t quite successful, but he did remind me of this book and that has to be a good thing. I read this book about ten years ago at a dark time in my life when I had just separated and moved out from the ex-wife. I had never been any good at drawing and generally hated books that went on about the right brain / left brain distinction – so I’ve no idea why I picked this up. But I did pick it up and almost immediately became fascinated. You see, it diagnosed my problem with drawing in the first couple of pages and then gave me clear and competent instruction into how to make me a better drawer. For years at Primary and High School I had sat in art classes and learnt next to nothing. I wasn’t exactly the naughtiest boy in the class, I would sit and do whatever was asked of me, but all of my ‘art’ was pitifully bad. Like getting a dyslexic to read Shakespeare aloud for the class, there was something cruel in putting a pencil or paint brush into my hand. The problem was no one ever told me that you need to draw what you see – that is, literally what you see, not what you think you see. When we are kids we learn to draw ‘symbols’ of things. We draw triangles for noses and spread out heart shapes for mouths. But these symbols are not what people actually have. People have real eyes and real chins, not a collection of symbols. Just learning that, and that alone, was enough to change the way I drew. The point wasn’t to draw mouths and ears, it was to draw lines and shade and shapes. The other thing this book really taught me was the idea of flow. That being totally engaged in something is about living outside of time. I’m never going to spend enough time drawing to become a good drawer, but this book taught me that becoming a good drawer isn’t something that is genetically beyond me (something I pretty much assumed must have been the case previously). It taught me that the beauty of drawing is in how lost one becomes while drawing – as one does when writing poetry or extended prose. Time melts away. The point of drawing is to melt time, not really to produce great drawings. And this book taught me how to look. It made trips to the art gallery so much more interesting and worthwhile. The drawing exercises in this book should be virtually compulsory in schools. As a child who would, when asked to draw, scribble something tiny in the upper corner of the page – someone afraid of the momentum of lines (something I’m still afraid of) this book was like a light being turned on in a very dark room I had spent a lifetime stumbling around in. For years afterwards I would sit in meetings drawing my left hand. Like I said, Art teachers should be using this book as a matter of course. If you can’t draw a face without blushing, please, read this book – it will show you what the kids at school who could draw worked out on their own and why, without being shown, you never really had a chance of learning."

I mean, really. My drawings at this stage without too much more practice resemble the album covers of emo-teens with acoustic guitars, but I am certainly doing much better than Napoleon Dynamite. Big time. I think the approach to art that it presents is really intriguing - that we are primarily hammered into left-brain dominance through the acquisition of language - and it is through a reconnection with defamiliarization and the foreign thought process of our childhood that we can shed this brain drain we have lived with for so long since elementary school. I still have a long way to go with this - I find that symbols are constantly at war with my conceptualization of the world (and strangely I am wondering if that takes away the beauty with which we see it, after all, a rose is a rose is a rise, right?) - but this book is certainly a big step in shedding the messed up approaches to visual thinking that I have acquired. As a writer I am at an even bigger disadvantage, but I am on my way. I have learned a great deal more than any other drawing manual I have encountered so far, and it really helps to understand that it is not me - that anyone could be a good illustrator given the correct parameters and education on the visual arts."

This is a very popular title that frequently pops up when people ask for recommendation on books that teach drawing. Reviews on Amazon are overwhelmingly positive, which is not a surprise. This book not only teaches you how to think (and not think) when drawing, but also teaches you the techniques to draw. In short, it teaches the approach and the techniques. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain works on the premise that the right side of the brain is more suited for drawing, and teaches you how to engage it for drawing purposes. The different chapters are on contour drawings, negative space, sighting, portrait drawings, colors, light and shadow. At the end is an additional chapter on handwriting art. There are easy step-by-step exercises to follow along. Results will be visible but all the exercises must be done. Perfection requires more practice, of course. The techniques can be easily applied to challenging tasks like drawing foreshortening or a realistic portrait. One thing I noticed on online art forums is, beginners generally like the book. Those who have been drawing for a while say that left & right brain thing is more marketing and drawing is just about focusing. The thing is, this book provides the basic techniques to get people started. And yes, I did read everything and went through the exercises, which aren't really too hard. This book is highly recommended to beginners learning to draw."

It immeadiately changed the way I viewed things. It was one of the pivotal books of my life (I ought to include that as a tag.) When I home-schooled my then suicidal teen daughter and sat her down with this book, she flipped through it for 15 minutes, and started drawing as if she had been taking lessons her whole life. She found a talent she didn't know she had (and several others, but not because of this book.) I highly recommend it for anyone who says ""I can't even draw a stick figure."" This book may change your mind."

For those with the heart of an artist but none of the talent (like me), it teaches a whole new way to look at and draw things. I remember that I enjoyed many hypnotic mellow hours practicing what I was reading. I also remember that if you concentrate on the the shape of the spaces and shadows instead of the lines of an object, you can draw a pretty accurate picture/portrait."

I've never drawn from life before (only from two-dimensional photographs), but already a few lessons in, I've been doing so (see images below, which were done in an 8-day period)! Progress is impressively rapid with this method. I've never had more fun with a book! We're using this as a homeschool art curriculum and will continue to use it through the 2012-2013 school year. I think of this main text as the ""teacher text."" It has long but interesting explanations about how the right and left hemispheres of the brain function, and how to access the parts needed to draw what you see. This is overkill for younger students (which is why I recommend the accompanying workbook as a ""student text"" since it gets down to the bare-bones of drawing.) The author divides drawing into 5 basic skills: the perception of edges, the perception of spaces (negative space), the perception of relationships (sighting perspective & proportions), the perception of lights & shadows, and perception of the whole. The DVD will give you a crash course of the book. I highly recommend viewing the entire thing before beginning to draw, as it makes the material in the book so clear and your progress will be rapid. The book will allow you to dig deeper into the concepts briefly presented on the DVD. One of the interesting things about this book is that its principles can be applied to other creative endeavors beyond drawing. I see applications for writers here, too. Here are some of my own drawings so far: Lesson 3 of the DVD: My Hand (perception of edges) Lesson 4 of the DVD: Chair (perception of negative spaces) Lesson 5 of the DVD: ""Doorway"" (perception of relationships) If you want a hassle-free way to get all the drawing materials you'll need for this book, go to the .

One's beliefs would be justified, as the book follows the left-right-brain story intently. It's not really the crux of the book, however. From my perception of the book, it is easy and sometimes necessary to separate the scientific motivations behind Edwards' drawing exercises from their rationales and ultimately their results. One enters the book with an explanation for the average person's inability to draw from observation; that is, that drawing for most people is dominated by the symbolic, analytical, linguistic, mathematical chunk of the brain, the studious Left Hemisphere. Hence, the simple barrier to learning to draw from observation is allowing the creative, objective, and somewhat whimsical Right to handle the observation for us. One can benefit from the insights held in this book without the left-right narrative, but the science behind them might, rightly, goad into drawing those who describe themselves as ""not really artsy"". To a high degree, that's just the person the book is largely marketed to: a person with little experience and asymptotically little interest in drawing. That being said, whether you're a hobbyist or someone just beginning their tortuous self-criticising art career, pick up this book, give it a good read, and do the exercises if you think they'll help. Do that, and pay no more heed afterward to this book, for it limits you intently in what it advises you do to draw well. After looking through this book I very quickly turned to Burne Hogarth, Andrew Loomis, and Robert Beverly Hale, authors who focus primarily on figure drawing for illustration. Their instructions rely heavily on exactly what Edwards warns against: drawing figures by relating a system of symbols to one's perception. In the years since reading DRSB, I can safely say the authors listed prior have given me far more tools for drawing well. Edwards' book is a good primer if you want to learn to draw accurately; if you want to draw masterfully and effortlessly, however, your only venue is, in the end, practice."

I picked it up because I'd heard lots of good things about it, because I could stand to be a lot more creative, and because I couldn't draw to save my life. It's true that the author is prone to wax poetic about the drawing process; at one point, for instance, she suggests you draw the folds in your palm without looking at your palm, and calls the result a ""beautiful record of consciousness"". However, It's also true that this book made a huge difference in my ability to draw what I see, especially given how little time I was able to spend working through the examples. I've never taken an art-related class in my life so every method was new to me. Just using a few of her recommendations (drawing negative spaces, for example, and trying to keep from naming what you're drawing) produced a shocking difference in how my drawings turned out. One excellent attribute of this book is that you can do most of the exercises with just a paper and pencil. The author recommends that you buy graphite and a special frame and bond paper and all kinds of other things, and I'm sure they're helpful, but in the end what you're doing here is pencil drawings, which everyone has already done in meetings and classes. This book did not make me an amazing artist, but I cannot imagine a more immediately practical and helpful guide for someone who just wants to be able to draw--like, yesterday. 5 stars. My one beef with this book is that it claims to be a handbook for increasing creativity, but the book is really only about one thing: . That means you can draw from still life, or from someone sitting very still for half an hour. With regards to creativity, the author has several markedly defensive paragraphs in which she points out that there are modes for self-expression within the realistic format (for instance, you can use cross-hatching to create a darker area OR follow the contours of the subject!). I was hoping, however, that this book would show me some methods for drawing realistic people and scenes, and at this task it was not very helpful."

It took me a while to read since I followed all of the exercises, to get anything out of this book I recommend doing the exercises (otherwise I'm not sure any of it would make sense) One could make a strong argument against the ""R-mode"" and ""L-mode"" naming conventions, however, the very proven pedagogical basis is hard to fault. Call it ""accessing your visual cortex"" if you don't like ""R-mode"", but the end result is the same. But still, there were at times too much emphasis on Right vs Left The handwriting section at the end was thoughtful, although a little forced as it seems bad handwriting is a pet-peeve of the author. Despite that, I found treating handwriting as an art to be as fun and engaging as the other exercises."

It helps new artists to push beyond what they think things should look like to actually seeing what they look like. If you're thinking of starting drawing as a hobby, you can't go wrong with this. There is a short section at the end of the book where the author tries to apply the core skills of drawing to the decision making process in an effort to make drawing skills seem more necessary. I didn't feel that section worked very well."

Whether it's the right side or the left side or your knees that do the thinking, its quite irrelevant and I wish the author didn't put so much stake on the dubious inner workings and preliminary science of the mind. What is useful is the series of exercises that allow students to disconnect from the symbolic and verbal way of thinking when taking a realistic approach to drawing. This goes for painting as well in many aspects. I think the leap in confidence the book allows is remarkable for the immense majority of people that have allowed their logic to interfere with the proper way of seeing and translating what one sees, not merely as things but as shapes. I also liked the author's take on children and preadolescent art. Unlike many psychologists that ascribe convoluted theories to children's drawings, the author looks here for consequences of developing a language of symbols in the formal evolution of art while striving for realism and loosing the natural instinct for composition in the process. This is a great book to start. But once you've mastered the idea and are able to go into the trance, drawing what is in front of you, observing contours and negative shapes and generally looking without thinking , the next phase involves some serious , ahem, left brain activity. A realistic drawing is within reach but now you'll need to move on and make a good drawing. For that, there are plenty of other great books out there that will teach perspective (this book reduces it to a useful but limited extension of the previous techniques of mirroring the sighting), the creation of volume from within the figure, composition, edge and tone manipulation, etc. The power of achieving a qualitative step cannot be understated and therefore I recommend this book and its exercises with no reserves. Just don't get too enamored with which part of the brain is doing the work. I think that sells books but it might not be as useful to you."

It's actually got some good ideas in there, with alot of jargon that I didn't understand (and didn't really care to, you don't miss much). Looking back, I appreciate some of the lessons I learned from it. Even if you think you can't draw, give this a chance! Forget that you think all your drawings look like a kid's, and try it, it really was good for me. The main idea seems to be that we draw what we THINK we see, not what we actually see, because our brain interprets it on the way from our eye to our hand. It's so true! We did a lot of drawing from photographs turned upside down, to disguise the subject so that our brain didn't interpret it, and I think that was a good way to train your eye to see the real shapes. Of course, you still turn your picture around from time to time to get a good overview and see if things fit which you might have missed before, but overall the upside down method was useful for me when I was learning. That said, I really really HATED the portraits. Faces are a naturally complex subject to draw, and they are hardest to draw in pencil, and much easier with charcoal. I firmly am of the opinion that learning the anatomical rules to a face - learning to draw each of the parts separately, then how the head is proportioned and where the parts actually go on it (not just where we think they go), then combining the two - is a much better approach. Oh, and I really hated the hand drawings... where you draw your hand without looking at the paper. I understand the point was to train your hand and your eye to go at the same pace, but frankly I don't see anything wrong with looking at your paper and felt it was a dumb exercise every time I did it. Which was alot."

If nothing else, the idea that drawing is not a matter of manual dexterity (according to Edwards if can write decently, you can draw), it is a matter of how you look at objects and interpret it on paper was a boon. It made me stop thinking that I couldn't draw, and I couldn't learn to draw. I mean you must be able to learn to draw; think back to the days when an ""accomplished"" lady had to be able to speak Italian and do watercolors! Edwards uses a lot of jargon about the sides of the brain and modes, but basically the book boils down to the following: Instead of actually drawing what we really see, most of us try to draw symbols of what we see. It is really amazing--try it. Really examine objects and try to represent them on paper. I found that when I let my attention wander I would draw a line slanting the wrong way or the wrong length because I unconsciously slipped back into the mode of drawing what I thought the object looked like--not what it really looked like.[return][return]My biggest gripe about Edwards is her before and after portraits. Don't feel discouraged about them. In her seminars she has students use one method of drawing for the before and another method using charcoals for the after. Faces are hard anyway, and the charcoal makes it easier."

Betty Edwards seems to express herself quite well in the way she teaches and the methods she uses to bring an absolute beginner from nothing to actually having a chance at art. She focuses so much on activating the creative side of the brain, or the right side of the brain. In order to do that, she teaches you how to train your eyes to see properly and then drawing exactly what you see and not what you think you see. The text in this book is well worth the read so if you are thinking of buying this book, make sure you are willing to sit down and just read and read. It’s truly rich in its content. The book also includes exercises you should do in order to advance from being a simple beginner in art.

I sense it was more to say that L-hemisphere is not artistry and R-hemisphere is. - The last two chapters of the book I sensed was more about the Author's own opinions about the way she can use the tools rather than actual facts. One can have theories and create a lot of opinions on how to fit them into reality but do that really work? - A lot of self-theories but not real facts. I sense a deep explanation of her beliefs but zero proof for it. When it comes to things like explaining scientific concepts like the brain. Where are the graphics, documents, pictures? I understand there isn't the ""perfect"" book of art and I learned a few things reading this book. I followed all her drawing instructions but at the end... things like shadow/light are lacking explanation."

Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is definitely a resource I plan to keep around. Art is something that has always escaped me. I remember in elementary school there was a teacher who walked around to different classrooms with a cart teaching art, but that is all I remember. I do not remember any of our classes or really learning anything in that situation. I remember doing kits from a hobby store and learning different things that way, but the only one that stuck with me was cross stitch and later in my married life quilting. In first grade I won first price for a coloring contest, drawing and coloring, but that was just me having fun. I never learned any real skills. There was one summer, I think it must have still been in my elementary school years, where I took all sorts of classes on pottery and drawing and other things in artistic pursuit. I loved it, but nothing ever went any further. My schools did not have art classes after that, until I entered high school, but those classes were all advanced and for people that had been involved in art their whole lives so it was too late to get started. Now, a decade later I'm shown that it is not too late and that I indeed can learn to draw. That's fascinating! I have an advanced reader copy edition so I cannot promise that the final press print would appear like this. In my edition they are all black and white and some are quite dim and hard to see. But the real treasure in this book is not just in the images and examples but in the text. Reading through this book the student has a great teacher that cares about the skill of learning to draw. Yet there is more in psychology and neuroscience mentioned as well as teaching direction to draw. It is not surprising after reading through Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain that this is ""the world's most widely used drawing instruction book"". I agree that this book is written for all in the professional, academic and even hobbyist frame of mind. *Thanks to Tarcher/Penguin for providing an ARC for review.* posted:"

As it turns out I was right and glad I bought it too, it is amazing! Betty wrote it very clear, concise and simple to understand especially for the beginner in mind. I like the fun little exercises inside too. And you know what? They really work! Know keep in mind I was just a beginner then and when I would finish an exercise and find out to my surprise that I had actually had done a good job I was excited as every novice is probably. Sometimes I go to my shelf and pull it for old times sake. I think this book is timeless, it should be read by anyone deciding to begin a life as an Artist. Of course I gave it 5 stars...

It involves creating something out of nothing, after all. With simple strokes on paper, we can trick our brains into believing there is something more than just lines. It's truly powerful stuff when you think about it, but then why is it so hard to just copy what you see? is a guide aimed at those who think they will never be able to master this particular craft. Through practical exercises and insights, Betty Edwards teaches readers to enhance their drawing skills by tapping into the brain's right hemisphere, which is responsible for creativity and visual perception. One of the things that makes drawing from life so difficult is that our brain likes to play tricks on us. In most circumstances, this makes life much easier: our mind basically fills in the blanks, and we perceive things more wholly than we do. When it comes to drawing, logic and rationality can suddenly become a hinderance: we simply won't believe that one chair leg appears shorter than the other because we that they are all the same. What this book teaches is how to overcome those blockades. As an illustrator, drawing is literally my job, so I might not be the target audience for this, yet I had great fun exploring this very conscious way of approaching something that has long become second nature to me. I did all the exercises and was surprised by the results. By changing up little things, recreating what's in front of you suddenly becomes easy and accessible. I also enjoyed how Edwards conveyed the idea of drawing being more than just creating art, but instead being a fundamental way of understanding our world. By engaging with it in this way, we perceive reality more accurately and foster creative thinking. I think this is a great read for anyone who has stopped drawing as an adult, thinking that they are just no good at it. It's an unintimidating and approachable introduction to the subject!"

If you have been wanting to draw since childhood, but never managed to draw properly or scared of picking up drawing, please give this book a try. I can draw decently. I have done some good realistic sketches. But I didn’t know what to do next to improve my skills. This book helped me a lot in that journey. I didn’t really believe in all the pseudoscientific information she gave about brain workings. But her points about how to see and draw were really helpful. If you’re going to read this book, I highly recommend you to do all the exercises without skipping any. Don’t skip the viewfinder and picture plane. Use an old rectangular photo frame as your viewfinder/picture plane. I used a 2B pencil, regular eraser, sharpener , regular paper and a photo frame to do all the exercises. Don’t let the lack of supplies stop you. I can’t stress enough: do the exercises from each chapter before moving on to the next chapter. Cons: I felt like the chapter about shades was very weak. The book mainly focuses on portraits. Author said that portraits are intimidating, so doing them well will boost our confidence. That’s true. But I guess we can succeed only when we keep practicing and transfer the skills that we learned in this book to other areas of drawing."

It delves into the mysteries of the mind. It explores all the roadblocks that the pesky left brain builds to keep us from being the next Leonardo da Vinci. This is actually the book form of a live, instructional course taught by the writer. So there are mental exercises that are used to strengthen the right brain and force the left brain into the background. This is both a positive and negative. It’s positive in the fact that there is some instruction that leads you along a path. Some other art books tend to speak of ‘ideas’ but don’t really tell you how to achieve an idea. The negative is that it becomes slightly tedious to read. Almost like programming a VCR. Do people still do that? How about putting together a kid’s toy? Anyways, once you do the exercise a few times, you’ll have the method memorized. Do they actually help? Yes, I believe so. It tells you why you can’t draw and describes an exercise to get over a particular shortcoming. I think ‘natural’ artists tend to see the world differently and this book, if you put in a lot of time, will help you see the world that way. Is it a quick fix? No, you will have to spend months doing the exercises over and over. If you don’t want to draw, the book is still interesting as it explains a few facts about the human mind. Explaining why people tend to fear drawing once they get older. Why it is so hard to draw in perspective. Also how the two sides of the brain interact and how the left brain is a bully.

This is a wonderful book in teaching you how to see, and then how to draw. Essentially, to be able to draw is not about the skill of the hand but the ability of the eye to see. The exercises help you learn to see: 1)edges (contours) 2)negative space 3)perspective and proportion and using a basic unit as measurement 4)light and shadow 5)wholeness I think it is important to do all the exercises as it did give me a little more confidence. These are 5 essential skills, and as we move along to learn about colours and the use of other mediums, we still need these 5 skills. The last 2 skills (not taught in the book but mentioned) in art is drawing from memory and from imagination. But these need to be built on the first five. I am very glad to have read this book, as there are many drawing books in the market and from what I see, many are not very useful because they teach techniques but not how to see."

The key being that this book teaches you how to 'see'. In order to draw with accuracy it is necessary to let go of your preconceived notions about what things 'should' look like and using symbols to represent features rather than observing what is actually there. This book is an amazing tool for learning how to work with your own brain and become really observant and powerful artistically. I have seen it make a huge impact on my art and that of others I know. I also noted when I first read this book that my first art teacher in school used some of the early assignments to teach us to draw.

This book helped me discover the joy of drawing realistically, especially capturing portraits. When I was a young teenager, this book resonated deeply with me. I remember doing the exercises in it from cover to cover. I grew in my mastery of drawing, and in expertise at capturing a likeness on paper. I was also able to use the book as a jumping-off point in teaching my own art students. While the book doesn't encompass everything—layout, composition, color theory, abstraction, etc—its core message of mastering draftsmanship is invaluable.

Betty convinces you that you can draw no matter what... maybe part of it is that placebo effect but that never worked for me before :P Anyways she has alot of good information in the book, she also has some exercises I found helpful in forcing your mind to study a image and each part of it in concordance with other parts to attempt to more accurately depict your drawing. In other words it helps your image stay as close in proportions to the original as possible. Unbelievably to me it worked the first time, I mean my drawing was no where near perfect but it was much better in proportion than any previous drawing I had ever done. I was quite surprised. While this information is helpful and the book will certainly make you a better artist there is nothing like practice. Unless you practice alot you will go nowhere so keep that in mind :)"

I don't disregard it because I have seen myself draw a few things that I never thought I could manage. However, when I'm not doing the specific exercises my drawing is no where near the quality of what the book claimed I should see.

Well-written with many examples and pertinent figures. I Loved the before and after drawings of Art Students, done just 3 days apart with a remarkable improvement. There were many drawings of professional artists as well as drawings by Edwards and her fellow teachers. I loved the explanation (and it made so much sense) why most Art Teachers are so shitty at actually teaching students how to draw. Every art class I have taken started with a long list of very costly materials which I then had to go out and buy on a very limited budget--and then the ""teaching"" consisted of using the materials like ink or charcoal, making a huge mess with them and creating something no one (least of all me) wanted to look at, and the course ended with the expensive materials being stashed away to dessicate never to be used again. One beginning art class project consisted of creating ""art"" by cutting up the comics pages in newspapers and pasting them into an abstract collage. [The Art Teacher was so impressed by my newsprint project result they showed it to other classes as a shining example--which was mildly gratifying but not really. All I wanted was to LEARN HOW TO DRAW--or at least improve.] My least favorite word (in regards to Art) is Multimedia--this guarantees I am going to hate the finished product. Betty Edwards explains why drawing is so hard to teach, discusses the barriers to learning how to draw, and gives step by step exercises to teach the skills to oneself and students. There is an emphasis on drawing human faces. I loved learning about proportions of faces and doing so, I was able ""see"" better than I ever have before. I will confess that I did not do all the exercises--but I did many of the ones that didn't require buying any materials, I plan to do a few others from this book, and have seen my drawing skill improve. These techniques are perfect to build on. Edwards' advice is spot on and she seems like a wonderful person based on how she writes about teaching and learning. Highly recommend this book to: anyone with an interest in How To Draw, Art appreciation, or Teaching Art."

I have been drawing since I was a kid, and in this context, I could see that a lot of what she was explaining I already kind of did it in an intuitive way. It was actually very interesting from that point of view, because I could see how someone who has always thought that they just don't have the talent to draw could really find this book useful, because it teaches you basic aspects of how to see reality in a way that, at the very least, you can copy it way more accurately. The method that she proposes, at least the one that I remember the most, of converting ·3D objects in 2D in your mind so you can see the proportions and distances more clearly it was interesting. Having said that, It wasn't really that useful for me, it was more like an interesting exercise and explanation. But I could also see the not so good part of the book, which is that in a way it can reinforce a tendency (that I already had) to ""flatten"" the way you see objects and reality and thus not making easier certain important processes that an artist has to learn, like being able to construct objects in perspective in your mind to be able to draw them from any angle. Basically, it's a book that it's better for people that think that they can't draw, and in any case, an interesting read, although I don't completely like her approach that she takes."

As a kid I loved it but haven't drawn a thing in years (though always liked the idea of ""being able to draw""). Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a highly recommended and insanely popular book on learning to draw. And I can see why, as it's power to motivate and get you drawing is immense. The book starts by asking you to sketch a few pre-instruction drawings. This includes a self-portrait, a drawing of your hand, and a drawing of the corner of your room. The book is genius in that it does this so you have a baseline and can compare your later improved drawings to these earlier attempts. This contrast between caveman level inscription and reasonably recognisable drawing with some semblance of shape and form is Betty Edwards way of visually showing your progress as you work through the chapters. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain starts with a focus on edges and negative space, then moves onto proportions and perspective, before looking at things like shading, composition, and hatching. But through each chapter of drawing tutorial, the book is teaching the most fundamental art skill on earth, the art of truly seeing. The book dives into the key concept of seeing exactly what is in front of you rather than what your brain is perceiving it to be, and by doing this it teaches that drawing from life or reference is nothing more than putting down exactly what you see. By completely changing the way you perceive and think during the drawing process, even simple sketching becomes remarkably entertaining (and the results also show an immediately clear improvement). The structure of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the key to its success. By taking you through each section and building on each previous lesson/skill, the book gradually expands the way you think as you draw, while improving basic drawing skills too. The steady progression and mix of simple exercises to more rewarding pieces always feels fulfilling, making this one of the most positively inspiring books to follow through with. The science behind the whole right brain/left brain thing may be complete junk (or at best inconclusive), yet even as a metaphor rather than scientific fact, it still applies very well. And while the science itself is not touched on much here, some chapters going into topics like the way drawings change and adapt in children as they age prove to be fascinating. My one criticism is that while there's plenty more reading needed to build on the starter skills taught here, this book gives very little guidance on where to go next, or how best to maintain the progress made here. This book took me from being someone who ""would love to be able to draw"" to someone who draws, and that alone pretty much says it all. 5 left-sided stars."

No wonder the college drawing class that required this book frustrated so many of its students as much as it taught them. Having re-read this book in its entirety, I have to say that it's a wonder any of us continued to draw after graduating that class. If you can ever get past the horrendously warped theology and the interesting, but ultimately aimless ramble through neuroscience, there’s a fairly decent introduction to some useful drawing skills in the final few chapters of this book. But getting there is such a chore... Betty Edwards has a lot of good techniques to teach beginners (eventually), but her assumption that we must achieve an altered state of consciousness and “shut down” one half of our minds in order to draw effectively is ludicrous at best—dangerous at worst. The author treats the left hemisphere of the brain as if it’s the villain of a story, and proceeds for chapter upon chapter of theory-crafting in order to convince us of its villainy and teach her readers to silence all thought and perception provided by said hemisphere in order to achieve a perfect state of mind in which to “really see”—thereby intentionally causing frustration, confusion, and a reliance on this trance-like state in order to ever draw. (You might think I’m stretching that a bit and being too harsh, but I’m not. The author herself admits as much multiple times right there in the text.) If you can wade past all of that, however, the actual drawing instructions in chapters 6-11 are quite well written and educational. Mercifully, this section of the book is relatively free of the author’s meandering theories. In the back half of the book you’ll find wonderfully simple-to-comprehend lessons on perspective, sighting, portraiture, foreshortening, negative space, shading, and a short lesson on colour theory. Things that are when learning to improve your drawing skills. If you’re interested in studies about the brain, I highly recommend reading the first few chapters (with a grain of salt, of course, and understanding that the actual scientific research she references has likely advanced beyond the contents of those chapters in recent years). But if you simply want to learn to draw, I recommend at most skimming the first few chapters—avoiding like the plague the exercises on achieving an altered-state of consciousness (shifting from the so-called “L-mode” to “R-mode”)—and starting with a more thorough reading and working through the drawing exercises beginning in chapter six. Learn the techniques for measuring and sighting, for observing lights, shadows, shapes, and spaces, and let the rest of it go. No trance necessary."

I'm a novice artist. I had heard alot about this book so thought Id give it a read. Firstly, it's filled long winded psychobabble. The whole left and right side of the brain fighting for tasks is outdated. She talks about this alot, when really I only wanted to get to the exercices. But the exercises felt somewhat pointless. One exercise, drawing upside down, I did fine with this, but not, I think because it was upside that but because I'm not a complete beginner. A couple of years ago I had tried this upside down drawing and hated it. It was terrible and I hated the assumption that it would be good. Betty does the same. After each exercice she tells you that she's sure you will be pleased. For those who aren't, I think this will be frustrating to read. I found the blind drawing exercise, strange and not something I'll do again. I don't see it teaching me to pay more attention to what i actually see. In fact I think it would make me pay less attention, because there are no real results. Betty neglects to inform her readers that drawing takes practice and repetition. You will likely have to do a task multiple times before you improve. I do find the viewfinder and plastic sheet a good explanation for how to draw what you see for beginners. I didn't try it as I didnt have materials but I can see that clicking for beginners. I quit the book shortly after this. Tired with her waffle. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do decide to give it a try these are the materials you need. -Clear plastic, about 8x10"" and 1/16 thick -two ""viewfinders"" made of black card-board, about 8x10 -non-permanent black felt-tip marker -graphite stick #4B -masking tape -eraser -two bidner clips"

In the 1950s Roger Sperry studied split brain patients, mostly epileptics whose corpus callosum had been cut. That research has been out of date since 1970. Unless you're a split brain patient, you do not do types of activities such as drawing with only 1 side of your brain. You use all of your brain. Except for handedness, lateralisation is very minor. She would have been more accurate if she had said paint in a creative mode, not an analytical mode. Something along the lines of paint like you’re feeling the subject. Don't paint like a engineer. Don't tell yourself ""I’m painting an eye. That's an eye. Make it look like an eye."" Instead, observe the eye. Paint the light . Paint what you see, not what you tell yourself you see based on preconceive notions of what you think you remember an eye looks like. The main point is to learn to see. Her science is wrong, but the idea that you need to stop being over analytical and logicical is right.. Despite her lack of understanding of science, the book helped me improve my drawing and painting skills."

It forces you to loose all of your natural style and original artistic talent to learn to draw just like everyone else. This book was used in my college Drawing I class and it was honestly awful. I literally burned my copy of it so no one else would read it. I'm not saying it can't help you, maybe if you have no drawing skills whatsoever... but for me it really messed me up and set me back when I thought that I already had some natural ability.

But the theory is mostly something you can casually consider in broad terms while still trying to change the way you approach and think about drawing, and I think that's a fairly useful framework for trying things a different way. It was helpful to a point for me, and included some exercises I had done before in art classes but that are perennially useful to play with, like blind contour drawing and drawing what you literally see instead of what you imagine a thing to look like. It didn't unlock the secrets of drawing for me, but it did lead to some helpful experiments and a few things I will take with me as I try to not be tragically terrible at drawing."

A classic for a reason. There are a few ideas in it which are in dispute - namely, that ""right-brained"" work flow allows you to ""zone in"" like an athlete during a perfect performance. Even if you don't buy into this, there is something to be said about how ""zoning in"" lets you work more freely, and focus on the ""working"" aspect of the drawing rather than the ""what to draw next..."" aspect. She in fact teaches that you will eventually draw like an autonomous drawing robot in full gear. What does have value is her chapters on children's drawing, drawing left-handed, and her section on the intersections of handwriting and drawing."

Two stars says it is ""ok"" and I guess it is okay for most people even with the flawed idea that our right and left brains are somehow separate.

This work was one of the author's first practical educational applications of Roger Sperry's pioneering insight into the dual nature of human thinking... ""verbal, analytic thinking mainly located in the left hemisphere, and visual, perceptual thinking mainly located in the right hemisphere."" The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; the right hemisphere controls the left side. ""Left-handers excel in mathematics, music, and chess. And the history of art certainly gives evidence of an advantage for left-handedness: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael were all left-handed."" We are provided with drawing exercises and ample instruction to proceed with developing our abilities with drawing along with the five basic skills of drawing: One: the perception of edges, Two: the perception of spaces, Three: the perception of relationships, Four: the perception of lights and shadows, and Five: the perception of the whole, or gestalt. Drawing materials are also listed in detail for each drawing exercise. Upside-down drawing is an exercise that reduces mental conflict and the use of this gap in the abilities of the left hemisphere to allow R-mode to have a chance to take over for a while. This work will enable individuals to express themselves in drawing, the nonverbal language of art. As we have experienced, a contributing factor in the decline in right-brain centered academics throughout educational institutions during the early adolescent school years and beyond, have successfully precluded the natural development and intelligence growth significantly amongst the populous over the past few decades... and this will, no doubt, continue, producing additional lower-level-intelligence generations in future years. ""The right brain—the dreamer, the artificer, and the artist—is lost in our school system and goes largely untaught."" (See other works' right-brain science research related to Savant Syndrome for additional and current information on this important area of examination) This instructional work will assist the beginning reader-artist with essential tools to overcome many, if not all, childhood and preconceived drawing habits. If drawing is of no interest to the reader, this work may become tedious at times; if one is not inclined to 'structural' exercises, then this may not be a good work for them to consider. - Excerpts: ""Public-school teachers are also using my book. After twenty-five years of budget cuts in schools' arts programs, I am happy to report that state departments of education and public-school boards of education are starting to turn to the arts as one way to help repair our failing educational systems. Educational administrators, however, tend to be ambivalent about the purpose of including the arts, often still relegating arts education to 'enrichment'. This term's hidden meaning is 'valuable but not essential.'"" Author Betty Edwards PhD ""All of the exercises in this book, therefore, are based on two organizing principles and major aims. First, to teach the reader five basic component skills of drawing and, second, to provide conditions that facilitate making cognitive shifts to R-mode [Right Brain}, the thinking/seeing mode specialized for drawing."" ""In English, left comes from the Anglo-Saxon lyft, meaning 'weak' or 'worthless.'"" ""THE MAJORITY OF ADULTS IN THE WESTERN WORLD do not progress in art skills much beyond the level of development they reached at age nine or ten."" ""Beginners often think that drawing people is the hardest of all kinds of drawing. It isn't, actually. As with any other subject matter, the visual information is right there, ready and available.""

I know nothing about art theory, the last few times I picked up a brush was to paint a wall, and any time I spend with a pencil is usually to furiously scribble down notes. Trust me when I say I'm a total beginner. I always had the feeling I was lacking the talent for the arts, the flair for the creative, the discerning eye and steady hands that create beloved pieces for the world to see... As it turns out, this book was meant for me, and for anyone else out there with the mentality that they don't have that ""special something"" - it's a common feeling and, just as it was with me, a big blocker for most people to get started earnestly. Dr. Edwards addresses this directly as she makes the case for the importance of drawing: drawing, like anything, is a skill that can be learned, and is an important tool to teach perceptual training (a function of the oft-ignored right hemisphere of the brain, she says). Makes sense to me - I'm down with the cause! So I head to the nearest Dollarama, buy a sketch pad and some pencils, start following along with Dr. Edwards as she starts laying out theories on brain hemispheres, and seriously spend time with the various drawing exercises she details. Over the course of the book Dr. Edwards touches on and explains a range of subjects, which was very welcome to my beginner eyes. I can't comment on the accuracy of the brain-hemisphere stuff, but I DID learn some neat things about perception, negative space, lighting, and more - going along section by section, Dr. Edwards through her exercises and explanations attempts to help the reader discover and build the component skills of perception; the basic foundation of making great drawings. It's not so much a book on drawing techniques, but a book on teaching you the basics of how to see and think like an artist (whatever that means). So, at the end of it all, did my drawing get better because of this book? Well, I'm still a rank beginner but I was pretty surprised how much I improved over a short time period when comparing my initial drawings to the final exercises. Great success in my book! As I'm not familiar with the science I'm not sure how much of this bleeds into pseudoscience, and over the course of the book I did get a sense of patronizing/holier-than-thou attitude. Overall, though, it was an interesting and easy read with engaging exercises and, in my case, pretty effective outcomes. If you're a beginner like me looking for a place to start drawing in earnest, I'd definitely recommend this book. At the end of the day I've walked away with new perspectives, a basic tool set to draw on, and a new appreciation for the focus and labour that my creative friends put in to their works."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627206.The_New_Drawing_on_the_Right_Side_of_the_Brain/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I had mixed feelings about this book. The principles she focuses on are great and will help improve drawing skills. It's worth it for that if you are wanting some drawing instruction without paying for an expensive class. The materials you need to collect are going to be kind of expensive and, if not hard to find, will require you visit several different places around town to purchase them. The exercises are fine, they will definitely help you work on each of the principles, but she pretty quickly has you do exercises that require later skills to make them work well. So for example, shading and shadow is the very last skill she introduces, but it shows up in the very first skill's exercise. I think she could have separated out the skills a bit more distinctly. I also think part of the problem lies in her examples she shares. She's always showing master works or drawings she's done and it kind of seems like while she had a grasp on the different skills she doesn't always see how they are showing up working together in her examples. She also has you tone your paper in every damn exercise and frankly she should have made them work with plain white paper so you don't need the graphite stick and don't need to spend time shading and smudging your paper for 15 minutes before you even start. She also asks you to devote an hour or more to each exercise. Honestly, if I had that kind of time regularly I would take an in person class so I could get more direct instruction. I would have liked more shorter exercises to practice rather than one single long exercise. Finally, her brain science isn't particularly helpful especially since it's not totally accurate. She didn't actually have to use the left and right brain idea to explain that what she's really teaching you is to look at the world in a slightly different way so that you can reproduce what you're seeing on paper. She's also teaching you to get into a flow state so you can focus on your drawing and getting into that mode of seeing shapes, edges, shadows, and negative space without extraneous distractions. There's an abysmal chapter that she added at some point where she basically laments that we don't teach cursive in schools for long enough or require children to write in beautiful cursive and oh my god I almost threw the book in the trash for that chapter alone. I am so tired of teachers lamenting that nonsense as if it's so simple for all children to just write beautifully if only we forced them too and their brains won't develop properly if we don't force them to always write in beautiful cursive. Cursive sucks for a lot of kids and not everyone will have gorgeous penmanship. And no, not everyone had good handwriting even when people used to write letters all the time. Good lord it adds nothing to this book and nothing to help kids develop."

It literally changed my life and the way I think. Like many others, I thought 'being artistic' was a personality trait. Either you had it, or you didn't. 'Artistic' people could quickly draw some lines on a paper and make it into something beautiful. Or they could take a few objects and arrange them in a way that would make you say 'yes, this is really nice'. Or do a slew of other amazing things that I couldn't. Clearly I wasn't artsy and I understood that from early childhood and accepted it. The author noticed many people feel the same way and she was able to (accurately) trace it back to some time around the age of 10. Prior to that, everyone basically draws the same way: stick figures and circles etc. Everyone also loves art. But then, suddenly, some children are able to draw what their eyes see, and some aren't. That is, if asked to draw an apple, some 10-year-olds will draw a circle with a line sticking out, and others will draw a complex object that anyone would recognize as an apple. Those of us who weren't able to draw the complex object deemed ourselves to be un-artistic and draw a circle with a line in it, assuming that is as far as that skill will ever grow. Simply, this book gives you that missing art lesson you should have gotten right when you felt that way. How do you go from the circle with a line in it to an apple? As an analytical-minded person, what should you do? She teaches you that specific skill in a really straightforward way. Now, the part that changed my life: after this book, I started drawing and kept it up for several months. I drew some things that I was actually really proud of (still am). I didn't go on to become a professional artist or anything, but I understood that the art world isn't something inaccessible to me. It turns out you can have an analytical mind and use it art. You can learn art. You can improve on it. You can understand it. You can explore it. This book took art from ""something I can never do, and, at best, admire from afar"" to ""something I absolutely do, and something I can be really good at if I want to put in the practice"" 5 stars :)"

Edwards leads readers on a voyage of self-discovery and creative empowerment with rigorous attention to detail and a wealth of information. Edwards' investigation of the hemisphere functions of the brain and how they affect the creative process forms the core of this book. She explores the differences between the left and right hemispheres, highlighting the right hemisphere's special abilities in visual perception and creative expression. She assists artists in realising their full creative potential by drawing on these skills. Edwards exposes us to a variety of people that help to illustrate her lessons throughout the book. These figures, like the ""drawing brain"" and the ""perceptual switch,"" work as guidance for us as we pursue our artistic endeavours. They give a foundation for comprehending the transforming process of drawing on the right side of the brain and provide insights into the inner workings of our thoughts. Readers may advance at their own rate because to Edwards' thorough and well-structured pedagogical method. The activities and methods in this book can be used to improve one's spatial awareness, observational abilities, and capacity for new perspectives. She inspires readers to accept their creative inclinations by instilling confidence via engrossing tales and hands-on examples. There are a few disadvantages, though, that should be mentioned. The lengthy scientific explanations and theoretical debates could be too much for some readers to handle, especially if they are looking for a more practical approach that focuses only on technique. The book also predominantly emphasises realistic drawing, which could not entirely appeal to artists who prefer abstract or current techniques. The book ""The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" is an insightful manual for releasing one's creative potential. The knowledge of Betty Edwards, together with the inclusion of endearing people, gives the work depth and a sense of intimacy. This book offers as a source of motivation and empowerment for artists looking to explore new artistic boundaries and release their inner creativity despite its focus on theory and realistic drawing."

She writes that the left side of our brain handles language and logic, while the right side deals with creativity and emotionality. Drawing is a great way to tap into your creative side, so you can use your left hand for math and reading, and your right hand for art! Did you know that there are two hemispheres of your brain? You have a left hemisphere for language and logic, and a right hemisphere for creativity and emotionality. If you've ever wondered how to use this information to improve your drawing skills, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the book for you. It explains in detail what goes on in each hemisphere of your brain when you draw—and then teaches you how to use that knowledge to draw better pictures! I'm always interested in new techniques and ways to improve my drawing skills. I recently read Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about drawing. The book is divided into 10 Chapters: how to draw, how to think like a painter, and how to work with your hands. The first part explains how the left hemisphere of your brain controls sight while the right hemisphere controls touch and movement. It then goes on to explain how this information can be used to draw better pictures. You will learn how to use your right hand instead of your left hand when drawing. You also learn about various tools that can help you get started drawing with your right hand (like a pencil). The book even includes a set of exercises where you can practice using your right hand as much as possible! I love this book because it teaches me how to draw on the right side of my brain. It's a great way to improve my drawing skills and I think everyone should read this book! Dil Nawaz, Founder of The Lion Studios info@thelionstudios.com +923472058390"

The benefits I was hoping to get from it were two-fold: learn how to draw, and understand better how to engage the 'artistic' side of the brain. Whenever I think that I have to draw something, I associate it with dread and negativity. I absolutely hated drawing and painting when I was in school, my last memories of actually enjoying sketching and drawing must have been before I was 6. Even at that time I was of the opinion that we weren't actually studying painting or art, we were just given an assignment and expect to perform, but there was no instruction on a how. As an adult, I can't draw at all, I sketch out stickmen and that's about it. While I would love to learn how to draw better though, I approached this book with wanting to understand the theory behind drawing, what to look for, how to think about composition and what I'm missing from the artistic process. The writer recommends doing all the exercises in the book - I didn't do that because it's not an essential skill for me, it is more something I would like to understand at this point of my life. I would just like to have some starting points when I draw. Betty Edwards structures her advice in sections on edges, shadows and light, spaces, relationships and colours. She puts an algorithm behind perceptions that drawings achieve, such as how to use negative space, how to pick colours, how to measure shape dimensions and how to achieve flow during this activity. So even if I did not do these exercises, I now know where to start and what I will have to do if I choose that I would like to draw. I absolutely would would say that I would have loved if art classes were approached in this way, understanding how to perceive what you are drawing and how to translate the subject to paper. Absolutely great reading for those of us who feel embarrassment whenever they need to draw something in order to express their ideas accurately."

But in Betty Edwards’ Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, it talks about how to think about art in a different way and using the more creative right of the brain rather than the linear left side. One literary device that the author uses is Imagery. This literary element is used throughout the book where she describes how to draw in a way that makes it easier to visualize how to draw. An example of this is with her instructions where she has detailed explanations of how to follow the steps correctly. She also uses illustrations to further support this which are also effective because they show the steps and examples of famous art pieces that also use those steps and techniques. This is effective because it better shows the reader how to get better at drawing. Another literary element used throughout the book is epigraph where there are many quotes from famous authors on drawing. There are many examples of this throughout the book with quotes from artists related to the chapter. This is effective because it relates art to a wider perspective in looking how it changes your perspective of the world. Another literary device is extended metaphor which is used throughout the book to relate drawing to other activities. An example of this is related drawing to driving, which requires constant focus and drawing also require constant focus. This is effective because it creates a good analogy to how drawing requires a lot of attention in order to be successful in. Overall Betty Edwards’ Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a great book for anyone wanting to learn how to truly learn how to draw and how to improve your skills as well. It is also great how drawing and art as well can teach us how to look at the world differently for the future."

From beginners to experienced artists, this book revolutionizes the way we approach drawing and unleashes our creative abilities. Edwards ingeniously introduces the concept of ""drawing on the right side of the brain,"" emphasizing the importance of shifting from logical, analytical thinking to intuitive, perceptual thinking. Through a series of insightful exercises and thought-provoking anecdotes, she guides readers on a transformative journey that challenges preconceived notions about drawing. One of the book's greatest strengths lies in its ability to demystify the artistic process. Edwards skillfully breaks down complex techniques into simple, manageable steps, allowing even the most self-proclaimed ""non-artistic"" individuals to develop confidence and skill. With each exercise, she helps readers develop their observational skills, encouraging them to see the world in a new light. What sets this book apart is its incorporation of brain science and psychology. Edwards delves into the cognitive processes behind drawing, exploring the interconnectedness of perception, memory, and creativity. By understanding the brain's capacity for visual perception, readers are empowered to tap into their innate artistic abilities. ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" is not just a practical guide; it is a transformative experience. It teaches us that drawing is not reserved for the chosen few, but rather a universal language that allows us to express our unique perspectives. Whether you aspire to become an artist or simply want to explore your creative side, this book is a must-read. Prepare to be inspired, challenged, and amazed as Betty Edwards unlocks the artist within you."

To those with a deeper understanding of art, it probably won’t seem like a breakthrough book but for me, it was significant. My drawings prompted by the book, including my first-round drawings versus my final-round drawings, were (though still terrible) markedly improved. Some of the things I learned include how to view and use negative space (new concept for me), contours, and light vs shadows. The walkthrough of concepts followed by exercises were actually really fun, though required a good deal of time to set aside to practice. Overall, this book reiterates that drawing is an improvable skill, not wholly some intrinsic gift. As such, improving the skill requires regular practice. My one takeaway quote: “The arts are neglected because they are based on perception, and perception is disdained because it is not assumed to involve thought. In fact, educators and administrators cannot justify giving the arts an important position in the curriculum unless they understand that the arts are the most powerful means of strengthening the perceptual component without which productive thinking is impossible in every field of academic study. “What is most needed is not more aesthetics or more esoteric manuals of art education but a convincing case made for visual thinking quite in general. Once we understand in theory, we might try to heal in practice the unwholesome split which cripples the training of reasoning power.” -B. Edwards"

I read someplace there was a new edition available and I checked a copy out of our public library. Immediately I saw some of the same illustrations and was disappointed. Flipping to the reverse of the title page I saw it was published in 1999. It’s 2022 as I write this. Good drawing basics in 21st century U.S.A. don’t differ much from 50 years or so ago. Learning to draw from a book isn’t good though! One needs a teacher present to point out marks needing change and to verify you corrected the marks well etc. That’s why beginning drawing classes are in pencil and charcoal and students leave with grimy hands! Please don’t try learning to draw by using a book! Find a school or if there is none in your community, I can imagine you might find a tutor among folks in your community. Or go to any library where you may find with art books. Look at many, many of their art books with drawings included. Look at drawings that pull you in and study them, try to figure out where the artist began, try copying a few, look at drawings on Instagram or the free portion of YouTube & follow some artists you enjoy. Beware though that many “artists” sell classes on Instagram and YouTube. Many people on Instagram “ teaching art classes” did not attend art school. They took a few online classes. Clarify your expectations before paying for classes. Online drawing classes rarely give one individual feedback. That’s an essential part of learning to draw. If you want to play with some art materials I suggest “mixed media” online classes. There are countless options!"

Those skills are perceptual: perception of line, negative spaces, proportion, light and shadow, and the gestalt (drawing-as-a-whole). It is an excellent introduction for those (like me) who stopped trying to draw realistically as a child and never really learned to draw. It is NOT for anyone who can already draw realistically and is looking for a work on drawing technique. Kids from about age 10 can benefit from the exercises, although I think only readers from about age 15+ would have any interest in the theory (and maybe not even then). It's a great book, but a bit theory-heavy and not enough exercises. Yes, there are exercises for each of the skills, and several for each skill, but drawing is above all a practical skill, and it needs practice! This is especially true for me (I have ADHD and Asperger's, and I'm underdeveloped in hand-eye coordination and perceptual skills as a result). The companion book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain Workbook, has more than thirty exercises covering the whole gamut of skills and is an excellent companion to this, but it has none of the theory. Amazon has the pair of books available as a discounted bundle. I have found that this book has improved my drawing skills hugely. They have gone from abysmal to merely bad! And that's with maybe five total hours of practice. I confidently expect that with diligent practice of the skills taught in this book, they will improve to I'm-not-embarrassed-to-show-my-art levels. Strongly recommended."

I graduated with my B.A. in Drawing & Painting and my Teaching Certificate in 2009, and ever since then this book has been recommended to me by different people at different times through out my teaching career. Over the last few years, I even obtained *tw0* copies of the book, which I placed on my bookshelves (one at home, one at school). I had a genuine interest in the book, and every intention of reading it, but as I much prefer reading for pleasure (novels, memoires, etc.) over information, I just never got around to it. The class I took had me read this book cover to cover, and complete many of the drawing exercises inside. It also came with a series of video sequences hosted by Betty Edwards. Having just completed the course last week, I'm currently at an MA +39 credits and this course was the *MOST* helpful, useful and informative I've taken to date. Even though we've got three months of school left, I'm eager to begin utilizing Edwards' exercises in my intro-to-art classes next year. Edwards does a fantastic job of taking very complicated ideas (basically how your brain works) and breaks it down into digestible information that really makes sense. Her exercises are quick and meaningful, and if utilized correctly can help anyone - whether you've never picked up a pencil in your life, or if you've got your Masters in art - become a better artists. I fully recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning how to draw, or wants to improve their teaching practice."

It took me, literally, from stick figures to realism in seven weeks! I couldn't believe it. But the technique is actually simple, and the new steps added each week filled in the entire picture. I can only super highly recommend this book! It is easier to take a class with a knowledgeable teacher, because in the beginning, those who don't know how to draw will be a bit intimidated. I taught this class for over 30 years in various cities around the country. I mostly taught in community colleges and Parks and Recreation and it was always the most popular class. The reason it was so popular, is that all I said in the beginning was: ""Follow the instructions and do the homework, and you will be drawing realistically by the end of this class."" And they did! I have numerous ""before and after"" drawings, and many letters from those who took the class. I have since retired, however, I can highly recommend this book!

The intimate experience of the artist -he who draws- and his point of view, it's still a fertile subject, that could help a lot of people as a therapy, and just because it is FUN. The lateralization and asymmetry of our brain was a popular theme for the pop culture a couple decades ago, hence, the aversion academics felt for tackling it for a while –but since I've been getting in contact with the serious work of guys like Mcgilchrist, I've thinking that it's due time to renovate out relationship with the good intentions behind books like this one of Betty Edwards. Edwards' work encapsulates a lot of potential for self-transformation (through sensibility and even flow) to anybody who has in check his or her arrogance. Hybris is a POISON for souls in general, but since I myself am artist and I've seen my struggle and the struggle of others from VERY close, I would say that [pride] it is, even more, for those who dare to transit the beautiful path towards drawing and art. Perfection is the enemy of the good. And what's good seems to me as the only way to excellence. I see Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, as an antidote to that kind of soberbia that makes people blind to the beauty of our world. It rehabilitates the atrophy of the ""artistic muscle"" we all used to had and that most of us stop developing at 11 years old."

She's always talking about looking out at the sun-dappled mesas of New Mexico, or using some other affected, high-falutin' lingo about her gloriously new age, trendy life. Meanwhile, I look out at the cracked concrete of my driveway in the Chicago drizzle and wonder how us normal people ever survived without people like Julia Cameron telling us about their fantastically charmed lives. However, I like the little mind toys in this book. I did the morning pages, and found them interesting. I strolled the aisles of dollar stores and played a bit because of her book, and it was fun. So, she gets two stars. If she were less Baby-Boomer Annoying, she would have gotten more."

That is something I fundamentally disagree with. You should not skip your child's soccer game to paint your masterpiece. Your kid is the masterpiece. All of the relationships in your life are masterpieces. I use that as an example but there are other moments in this book where self-indulgence at the expense of others is encouraged. This is loathsome. So why didn't I just give the book and the program a 1-star rating? Because there are some very good ideas in there. Namely the morning pages. They grow tedious for me but I do find them effective. Also, I highly recommend taking an hour or two out of your week to have an adventure in the world by yourself. This really is a great way to stimulate your creativity, no matter what your craft is. Overall, if you want to try this program, go for it and recognize which parts do and don't work for you. However, I must warn that there is an ugly side to what Julia Cameron preaches here and I won't endorse that."

At the time I first read it fifteen years ago, it did wonders to open me up creatively. I was still struggling to slough off some negative parental programming about being a writer, and this book (along with a good friend) helped give me permission to explore that side of myself. Since that time, however, my belief system has changed so radically that I no longer agree with a number of the book’s fundamental premises. For this reason, it would be hard for me to recommend it now. I do think it contains some good material in the form of useful exercises and uplifting stories about creative development. But those come with heavy doses of New Age spirituality and recovery beliefs that will likely make the book inaccessible to anyone who doesn’t view the world through that filter."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I can't rate this book, since my opinion of it veers wildly between five stars and zero stars. (ETA: two stars is maybe a fair compromise?) For those not familiar with it, The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a book that claims it can reconnect anyone with their ""Inner Artist,"" via a program modeled openly on AA's Twelve Step Program (it is not a coincidence that Cameron is a recovering alcoholic). As such, it conceptualizes creativity as something inherently spiritual and conceptualizes the artist as a channel for God's will. So. PROBLEM NUMBER ONE: For me, creativity is not something that comes from outside the self, but something that comes from deep the self. (And Cameron isn't actually very consistent, since her model of creativity seems to be something like the Puritans' model of the Elect: it's entirely out of your control, but you have to behave properly in order to be one. So her model goes back and forth between ""you have to open yourself to God's will"" and ""you have to find the ideas that are deep within you and nurture them into bloom."") Also, I admit this freely, I have all the spirituality of a brick, so treating creativity as something spiritual means it's something I'm excluded from, and I think I can be forgiven for not liking that model very much. PROBLEM NUMBER TWO: Cameron has (I hope unconsciously) reinvented one of Freud's more repellent ideas. Where, in talking about Dora, he postulates that ""yes"" means yes, and ""no"" means yes, Cameron explains that if you don't like any of her teachings, or if they make you angry, that just means you're childishly resisting the thing you need in order to heal. So, basically, if you question or argue with her, that's a sign you're Doing It Wrong. This idea annoys me more than a little. PROBLEM NUMBER THREE: Cameron is writing from a position of unconscious privilege. She has the freedom to assume that if you are blocked creatively, it is something you can solve by willpower alone, that it's more or less something you have unconsciously done to yourself because you are scared of being creative. She does not allow for health (either physical or mental) to be something that may be affecting your creativity, and although she acknowledges that there are people who are creative but who cannot create because they are too busy struggling to survive or to care for their children or whatever other actual and genuine impediment may be in their life that they cannot simply will away by rearranging their schedule a little, she has a serene confidence that none of are reading her book. As someone who has been unable to write, to a greater or lesser degree, for seven years (yes, you did read that correctly; I finished the principal draft of in 2009), I would like to state for the record that if the problem could be solved by willpower alone, And I resent the condescending attitude that the problem is all my fault, if I would just have enough self-insight to see it. PROBLEM NUMBER FOUR: Cameron is of the same school of thought as and , that writing (and other forms of creativity) is basically therapy, that creativity comes from the well of psychic injury. Now, writing be theraputic, and tremendously so, but this model of writing-as-therapy, as direct one-to-one correspondence stream-of-consciousness therapy, does not work for me and never has. PROBLEM NUMBER FIVE: Cameron believes ""The universe will always support affirmative action"" (194), that if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe will send you what you need. Always. Now maybe it's just because I've read too much true crime and it's made me cynical, but I can't help pointing out that sometimes, if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe sends you . The universe is inherently benevolent. It is inherently indifferent and does not give a fuck whether you succeed or fail. Some of these problems are merely annoying; some of them are potentially destructive to writers (and other artists) if they take them as gospel (pardon the pun); some of them are irresponsible and dangerous. But despite all that, and despite the fact that I did not so much the Artist's Way as it, there are a lot of valuable ideas in what Cameron says. Some of them were things I already knew, but needed to be reminded of, like that, just like any other form of creativity, writing requires continual practice. Even if you can't write a story, you can still write , and you need to. ""Sloth, apathy, and despair are the enemy,"" she says on page 62, and I agree with that whole-heartedly. And I love her idea of true north, that two people can have the same goal, but their , the thing pulling them like a lodestone, don't have to be the same. And I would follow that with, if you lose your true north, for whatever reason, you're going to have to find it again before you can get very far. She harmonizes with Csikszentmihalyi in emphasizing that the writer is well-served to value process over product, and she points out something I have, in fact, taken to heart; that when your ""sensible"" self asks, ""Do you know how long it's going to take you to do X? Do you know how old you'll be?"" the correct answer is, ""Just as old as I'll be if I don't do it."" Cameron also provides a lot of quotes from a lot of people, some of which I found wrong, some inane, some simply not applicable. But some I really liked, like 's """" (Which, okay, I'm not going to say ""The Waking"" is the greatest villanelle of all time, but I am gonna say it's pretty damn close.) Others: ""I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues."" --Duke Ellington ""Whenever I have to choose between two evils, I always like to try the one I haven't tried before."" --Mae West ""It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult."" --Seneca ""In a dark time, the eye begins to see."" --Roethke again. ""Look and you will find it--what is unsought will go undetected."" --Sophocles ""Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little. The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark."" --Agnes de Mille ""Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life."" --Linus Pauling ""The unconscious wants truth. It ceases to speak to those who want something else more than truth."" --Adrienne Rich ""The job of the artist is always to deepen the mystery."" --Francis Bacon (, not ) ""What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough."" --Eugène Delacroix (forgive him his sexism, he's been dead for a hundred and fifty-four years) ""Adventure doesn't begin until you get into the forest."" --Mickey Hart ""One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."" --André Gide ""A painting is never finished--it simply stops in interesting places."" --Paul Gardner"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"http://mrlshelflife.wordpress.com/201... The Artist’s Way, while it contains some gems, is an overall disappointment. I’ve started it several times and it took me this fourth time to get all the way through. I had previously blamed my inability to finish it more on myself than on the work in general. The book taken as a whole comes across as pop psychology mixed with a heavy dose of New Age philosophy. There is a lot of talk about nurturing the inner child that is our real artist, the child’s inability to accept raw criticism and how this creates emotional scar tissue. The inner artist child needs to be protected and nurtured and needs to have its hand held and be tenderly led through the miasma of the psyche of the growing artist. She even goes so far as to equate poorly delivered criticism to sexual abuse, and projects that don’t materialize to miscarriages from which the artist suffers as much as the woman who lost a child. That was where she lost me for good. The book is full of case examples; artists, novelists, poets, script writers, all of who benefited from Cameron’s twelve week recovery. (Should I understand this as Cameron, a recovering alcoholic, devising her own twelve step program?) All of these case characters are given to us on a first name basis. One example is Ted, a blocked novelist who after the program and twelve (that number again) years of working with the Morning Pages, now has three novels to his credit. Okay. Ted, who? I want to see his work. I also want to see Bob’s breakout documentary, the one that a teacher trashed so harshly that Bob hid the reels in his basement which was then flooded. Then, after opening up to Cameron about the lost project, copies of the reels are found and he uses he newfound creativity, found with Cameron’s help, to finish the documentary and do yet another. I want to see these works. I want to connect to the tangible success of people who have travel this path that Cameron is leading us on. But alas Ted and Bob are just two examples of the long list of one-name shadows walking through Cameron’s book. The works these people completed and published could be a source of inspiration but are denied us by this one-name, AA-style, anonymity. After a while I began to question how many of these people were real. The one example she gave that I found truly inspirational worked for me because she used the full name, a name I recognized (Blake Edwards), and a story about him that is well known. It was one I’d heard before and I was glad to be reminded of it. It is a loss to Cameron’s work that there aren’t more examples that the reader can actually wrap his/her hands around. Cameron also talks long and hardy about her own work, much of which is in the film industry. I checked on IMDB. The list is short, two of the citations are for “Special Thanks” on major works by other people. She talks about writing plays. I can’t find any. She apparently worked as a journalist but a quick (and far from thorough) internet search didn’t turn up any leads. I remember seeing one novel by her in the library. Google her name and the overwhelming return is for The Artist’s Way. This is not to minimize Cameron’s achievements but it would help if she threw up some street signs leading the way to tangible evidence of her own work that shows us her program works. Her idea for Morning Pages does have an application. It is an effective brain dump. It does clear the pipes, so to speak, but I don’t see the efficacy of a slave-like devotion to the practice. I used it long before I found The Artist’s Way. I called it “writing in my journal.” I use it when my head is cluttered with too much information, which often happens during my job running two departments in a busy hotel, and trying to maintain even the barest minimum of creative pursuits. I can’t see myself, however, locked into every morning spending up to an hour doing Morning Pages. I can put that valuable time to better use writing my novels, stories, poetry and blog posts. I will admit I did exactly what she said not to do; I read the book through instead of doing the weekly exercises. In fact the last few chapters were scanned rather than thoroughly read. I realized early on that my “blockage” wasn’t about my creativity. My creativity is fine. I have lots of ideas and when I sit my butt down and work I can actually write and what I write is usually pretty good. My blockage is my discipline, my self-sabotage, and my lack of confidence and I didn’t find Cameron’s prescription to be a healing balm for my symptoms. I started looking at what some of my favorite and most respected writers have to say about writing, unblocking, and producing work. They don’t talk about twelve step recovery and nurturing our inner child who never grows up. They talk about work. Getting pen in hand, or hands on the keyboard and working. They talk about working until it works. They talk about breaking through blockages with action, not weekly exercises and group therapy sessions. These people talk about writing as people of other professions talk about their careers. They talk about how it takes work, discipline and action, and confidence in your ability. They talk about being able to recognize good criticism vs. poor criticism, and being mature enough to deal with both at face value. They talk about the reality of rejection and putting it in its proper place and not letting it sideswipe your momentum. This is the approach that I believe will work best for me and my writing. © 2014 M. Romeo LaFlamme"

If I hadn't signed up for that class, I'm sure I would have never picked up this book. I expected The Artist's Way to be full of fluffy, New-Agey platitudes, and I approached it with cynicism and skepticism. However, I kept an open mind. I read each chapter thoroughly. I did the morning pages every day and an artist's date once a week. I did a handful of the exercises at the end of each chapter. And my life changed. The morning pages resulted in an award-winning nonfiction book, a series of children's picture book manuscripts, and the willingness to embark upon another, more challenging nonfiction book writing project. The artist's dates renewed my childlike love for the fiber arts, and I began creating beautiful handwork projects. I learned to surf. I joined a writing group. Most importantly, even more important than the concrete examples of creativity that have resulted, I was given a set of tools for life - tools that enable me to challenge that critical voice in my head, and to trust my instincts. I can't say enough about this book. It came into my life during a difficult time, and it has dovetailed beautifully with recovery in other areas in my life."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In essence, The Artist’s Way is a pop-psychology self-help book for blocked artists. And, like any other pop-psych self-help book, you get a little bit of preaching, a few tips and tricks and a bunch of homework. It’s not specific to any art form or technique—you could even argue that it’s not even about art. is a book about creativity in the broadest sense: it applies equally to writing, dressmaking, acrobatics, entrepreneurship, or anything that involves doing or making something new. What Julia Cameron offers in her book is a method to overcome crippling self-doubt, self-sabotage, and apathy. There are quite a few weaknesses in this book, however. First, the sermonizing part is quite literally an indoctrination attempt about God as the Creator and how God is creative, and why we should be so as well, and then God would help us be creative just as he is because God created man in his own image and if we don’t believe in his creative power, we are resisting our God-given talent and so on and so forth. Ditto regarding the who needs to be mollycoddled and pampered and healed and yadda yadda. Much of it, however, is an interesting slice of outdated hippie, neo-puritan psychobabble. Furthermore, Julia Cameron never tires of providing anecdotes about herself, her friends, her acquaintances, and her customers who, being stuck in a sterile rut for too long, have become almost like Balzac or Beethoven just by following her incredible “creative recovery” method. Unfortunately, the name-dropping is always relatively unspecific, and we never get to know who these outstanding creative persons were, so we must take Cameron’s word for it. As for the homework, that is probably the most valuable (although not ground-breaking) part of this book. It is broken down into a 12-week course, almost like an AA support group. The two essential building blocks of Julia Cameron’s set of exercises are straightforward: 1) The “morning pages” are meant to get us into the habit of writing a journal, which, in and of itself, is undoubtedly a beneficial practice: uncritically expressing and recording our thoughts and ideas on paper and getting our creative juices flowing—this is just a first step of course; writing is a whole different ballgame. 2) The “artist’s dates” are invitations to regularly take some alone time to take care of ourselves and do something we enjoy. Again, a healthy habit: taking care of the goose that lays the golden eggs… The book includes many more exercises that the reader can choose to do or skip. Overall, Julia Cameron’s programme is an encouragement to get one’s creative mojo back into gear. The most significant aspect of her method is probably honing one’s self-awareness, making things fun and enjoyable, letting go of fear and control, showing up and trusting the process. Easier said than done, but that’s indeed a fundamental part of the job."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I recently completed the 12-week book on my own, and I think that it was very well put together. I was already on my way to discovering a few of the main drivers in the book, but it would have taken me many years to collect them. I have been inspired by this book, and it has helped me work through things, instead of ignoring big problems with my creative process and trying to push them aside. A few of the reviews haven't been so kind for this book, which is okay. It is really hard to surrender to anything - it's hard to let go and give in to something. And I don't mean God or Christianity (which is the author's personal belief system which also influences a lot of the book) necessarily - I mean a process - put in place to help. It's hard to just do it, and be open to what this book can do and what can happen. That being said, I didn't agree with everything written in the book. It's not like it's The Creative Process Bible or anything (so don't feel like it's that way or the highway or anything). Sure, for a couple of the exercises I just wrote ""eh, that's okay"" instead of doing them, and many of the exercise questions were obviously trying to lead you in one direction. But I think that's hardly a reason to throw this book to the birds. First, if you're considering doing this but aren't sure, read ""The Artist's Way Questions and Answers"" in the back of the book (page 205 in the 10th Anniversary Edition that I had), and you'll get a really good idea of what you'll be doing every day, every week, and Julia Cameron's philosophical approach to her book. And finally, if you decide to do it, do it all. If you're like me, you barely finish anything and it takes a hell of a lot of energy to complete something - and sheesh a 12 week long thing? But, at least for me, the 12 weeks went by in a flash and I really looked forward to the readings and exercises, and was so enthusiastic with the kind of creativity this book helped me to find and produce. Enjoy it. When it gets frustrating and you don't have the time, deal with it. Skip a day. Come back and do a morning page and you'll inevitably write until you get to the bottom of why you are frustrated and skipped a day. It's a process, and it doesn't have to be perfect. Have FUN!"

[I had shared about the great fun I had once in a weekly three-month art therapy group].... “The Artist’s Way”, celebrates its 25th anniversary.... It’s a very popular book — 3,068 people reviewed it on Amazon. 85% - 5 star reviews! So.... many people got great value. However, this book wasn’t for me. I didn’t resonate with the religious aspects - nor am I an alcoholic - nor am I looking for a 12-week exercise program to reclaim my creativity - or change my life. I’m ok with not unblocking my hidden talents..... I’m not a “recovering” artist, and I didn’t care for the many assumptions to its reference. The writing was too flowery - - life is beautiful- for my taste. I’m okay being a sour-pussy uncreative average-Josie."

However, as a working artist, I appreciated this book and found value in her ideas. If you're at the beginning of your creative career, these ideas can give you support and encouragement to do the work and move past obstacles and negative attitudes, especially those expressed by others. **************************** 2019 re-read: Made it through the intro material and now working the activities for Week One. This is a pretty serious self-analysis/self-help program. I can see why people would do this as a course or with a group. Anyway, I started the daily pages and I'm contemplating what to do for my first Artist Date. ******* Finishing up the second week ""Recovering a Sense of Identity"" I have to say, I'm feeling positive results and I'm surprised at how well the morning pages are working... ********************* Some pretty deep moments working with this book and the daily pages writing. I'll be revisiting part of this during the coming year."

All 12 weeks of it. Well, 13 if you count that week I got pissed off and nearly quit. There's a week in there where she requires you to not read at all. No books, newspapers, comics. Back when this was published (1992) there wasn't the issue of mindless social media scrolling. So it was the issue of reading back then. Mindless reading. But I don't do a hell of a lot of social media, and the plasticity of actors in movies and TV gives me the willies so I don't watch much, so it wasn't a problem to hold off on those. But I do read. That was tough and I rebelled. Rebelled against an author in her old age a million miles away telling me what to do. Which was the point she was getting at. We've become blocked creatively because of our habits and we react like a hurt dog when there's the threat of change. Being personally well-steeped in recovery culture this book belongs near the 12 Step books and not the crafts section. She acknowledges her debt to the recovery manuals, and indeed, if one were so hardlined about it, one could claim she was reappropiating much of the teachings in Alcoholics Anonymous. But it's of no great importance. It's about finding a way back to that childlike sense of play. Taking back our sense of wonder that this goddamned digital age has leached from us. There are two main actions in this book. 1. Do your morning pages. 3 pages of verbal diarrhea, the contents of which doesn't matter, simply being at the page is what is important. She's teaching you how to ""rest on the page."" 2. Go on a weekly artist date. This I didn't really do because I felt foolish. She wanted you to go buy gold stars and penny candy to treat your inner child. So there's that. Being so familiar with the weird requests of therapists and sponsors, I felt no real enmity with anything in this book. And I came away from it with a habit now 90 days old, the habit of showing up every day at the page come hell or high water. I recommend this for the undisciplined among us, like myself, who've tried and tried to unbury the artist within, the one that became covered up and discarded as the years piled on, as responsibilities bloomed and laughter waned and adulthood came in front and center. Do they even make penny candy anymore?"

I've been doing it for ten years now, and I have learned many little tricks along the way. I'm going to employ one of them now to let you know if you're going to enjoy this book or not. Ready? The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity ...See what I did there? Mm-hmm. That's why they pay me the big bucks. I really wanted to like this book. Not only that, I really wanted to from it. I'm in the midst of trying to write a novel (I know, kill me), and I have several friends who spoke of it with great enthusiasm, so I went in with high expectations that it would help me become more regular and fearless while trying to write. I've struggled with perfectionism in writing far more so than I struggle with it in the graphic arts, which was surprising and dismaying. I was expecting creative exercises, suggestions, anecdotes, and perspectives on harnessing daily creativity; I was bummed to find pop-psychology, self-help platitudes, abstract hippie-dippie aphorisms, and impenetrably meaningless one-liners that read like stoner wisdom. That is an actual quote from the book. I read it with my eyeballs, which sent the words up to my brain, and my brain was like ""hold up...u sure?"" and eyeballs were like ""ya i'm sure :\ idk"" and brain was like ""ok i;ll tell her but shes gonna be pissed."" AND MY BODY PARTS WERE RIGHT, they know me very well. I think there are fantastic kernels of truth in here, and several practical exercises that could really be beneficial to a struggling artist, depending on their own self and their own process. But each of those kernels is shellacked with a thick coating of grandiose new-agey mumbo jumbo that I found nearly impenetrable. There's a line from my favorite superhero movie, , where a young woman has been imprisoned and tortured. She believes she is about to die, and it's a death she has chosen to protect principals and ethics she didn't realize she had until she'd been pushed to her absolute limits. When she finds herself suddenly and unexpectedly freed, and standing in a rainstorm overlooking London, she lifts her arms and says: ""God is in the rain."" It's a line that would read incredibly hokey if you hadn't just earned it enduring real spiritual anguish through her. Every-other sentence in is ""God is in the rain."" Each of them is clearly meant with great sincerity and conviction, but the effect (for me) was narmy almost beyond tolerating. There is a lot--a LOT--of talk that feels like it's straight out of . Cameron insists that God will provide for you. At one point she even says ""leap, and a net will appear."" I really think this kind of advice can be damaging. There are lots of people who've leapt and met only jagged rocks, and it can't be framed as their failure because they didn't believe hard enough or trust deeply enough or wait long enough. There are tons of practical considerations that she dismisses as mere negativity that factor into career artistic success. For every J. K. Rowling who used art as a trampoline to success and fulfillment, there are tons of broke, out-of-work, exhausted working artists who find themselves wishing they'd chosen painting/sculpting/acting/poetry/playwriting/photography as their hobby rather than their profession. I'd even go so far as to say this kind of irresponsible ""God will provide your materials!"" crap is the kind of crap that got a lot of starry-eyed millennials $180,000 in dream-following debt. YOU ARE NOT A SELL-OUT OR A FAILURE OR A SAD HEAP OF WASTED POTENTIAL JUST BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO TAKE CRAZY RISKS. I repeat, there are good ideas in here. The quasi-spiritual mumbo jumbo just made it a lot harder for me to keep an open mind. Coupled with her frequent too-broad statements (""all creatives,"" ""all artists,"" ""all art""), I felt myself irrevocably turned off by the end of the first chapter. My philosophy at this point is shaped by my own experience, and I'm very wary of one-size-fits-all solutions to blocked creativity. Cameron insisted at many points that I'd been scolded for my artistry at a young age by unsupportive parents, and that I turned to alcohol and drugs to mute my inner anguish, and that my lack of freewriting pages was an expression of self-sabotage rather than conscious choice, that I was jealous of more successful artists, and lots of other bold blanket assessments that just felt incorrect and somewhat insulting. What I have learned, through much toil, is that I can't write a scene until I know what my goals for that scene are. ""In this chapter, I need Character A to start to change her mind about Character D; I need to foreshadow this future event; I need to make sure Character B and Character C end on bad terms; I need lighthearted dialogue because shit's getting heavy in the next chapter; and I need them to move from Point A to Point B, getting waylaid in such a way that the journey takes two and a half days."" It sounds a little exhaustive, but I learned that it's exactly the way I design: before I start sketching anything, I have to know what the goal for the design is. ""Who is the audience? Who are the competitors? What did you do last year? What about your past campaigns have worked/not worked? Who are the stakeholders?"" Once I know those things, I do it once, and it's damn-near perfect. I hate wasting energy and duplicating efforts playing guessing games. Once I have that list of goals, I will sit down and do the whole thing in one sitting, changing very little, because I'm writing the scene the best way I can the first time. Not only do I not enjoy the process of ""free writing"" or ""just writing,"" it makes me spitting mad when anyone tries to drag me into it. I think those techniques work for a lot of people. But the reality is that I thought I was making less progress than I truly was because writing self-help books/articles like these told me I was failing as long as I wasn't writing every day. ""Just write garbage, it doesn't matter"" I have been urged so, so, so many times. I was driving myself further away from my creative goals by giving too much credence to the chosen methodology of self-appointed gurus. What works for me may look like non-progress, and that is okay. I thought it was interesting that by the end of the book, Cameron brought up the fact that art can (and ideally should) be done for its own sake, without an eye on a final product. I actually think here is where a psychological angle could've been extraordinarily useful. There is some art that I make for other people, and there is some art that I make for myself, or for itself, and differentiating those goals seemed like a really crucial component to skim over. The best advice that Cameron had was embracing selfishness by defending your free time and creative energy. It's impossible for me to do, because ultimately I love my chosen family and I will always put my stuff on hold to make wedding invitations and resumes and portfolios and business cards and websites and videos and paintings and crafts. That is just who I am, I am...like, 85% at-peace with that. I also ""mm-hmmed"" along with her description of the people in your life who are jealous creative saboteurs; I've got one of those, that is a real thing, don't you ever fucking breathe a word to them about your creative dreams. Don't you ever let anyone keep you around as a yardstick by which to measure their own success--they will attack you and your work the moment you grow too tall for their egos to tolerate. I ultimately am glad I read it, more because it challenged me to think about my own creative process as I found myself disagreeing with her. And although ""morning pages,"" the bedrock of her program, are not for me, there were a handful of interesting thought exercises that I did find intriguing. If introspective isn't something that comes easily and comfortably to you, this book might be a good stepping stone. I'd also recommend it if, in general, you respond to inspiring self-help messaging. But if you're looking for practical advice on writing better, or drawing better, or managing time better, I think there are much more valuable books out there. ( is my baby bible.) If you're already pretty introspective, like me, and you are sensitive to condescension, like me, I wouldn't suggest it. And if fuzzy statements like ""God is in the rain"" make your eyes roll: avoid, avoid, avoid."

I had been able to suspend my disbelief about the god thing until then, but in that chapter Julia Cameron asks you to believe that God wants you to be rich, which I'm not sure I would believe even if I did believe in a god. Generally, all the synchronicity and serendipity and whatnot was just too much. Having said that, the exercises are pretty valuable. I plan to skim the book and flag useful-looking exercises to complete on my timeline -- not Cameron's!"

But, of course, I never did it. So I thought I would listen to the book and refresh my memory, and again I feel it would do me good. But will I do it this time? I have many other artists friends who have read it and also planned on doing it, but I don't know if they have either... The Artist Way is a book written to unblock artist of a kinds, writers, painters, actors ect. I can't say that I'm blocked, but it is hard to carve out time and feel creative in this crazy world we live in today. It is even harder to work on something of your own when you are actually working in the art field daily. The last thing you want to do when you get home from work is more work. The book is full of exercises to get you on that creative path, week by week, 12 in all (I think). The main exercise, one you do the whole time, is the one that is holding me back from starting. It's called Morning Pages. This exercise is doing a stream of consciousness journal first thing in the morning every morning. I am not a morning person, and I don't know many artists that are so writing anything, even spewing crazy off the wall and top of your head stuff is asking a lot. I don't think I could hold a pen at that moment, let alone actually write with it. Before coffee? I do recommend this book to all my creative friends reading this. As I said, I can see how it would work.....if you did it. You can't win, if you don't play."

I was living in Reno and then in Charlotte, NC when the book's popularity hit its zenith and there were Artist Way groups that got together at bookstores, libraries, community centers, and coffee shops. The biggest takeaway for me was morning pages--writing, by longhand, three pages of stream of consciousness stuff going on in your head to get it out of the way. Cleanse your pallet. It also made me aware of crazy makers in my life, which, at the time, I wasn't ready to let go of. But I think this book was part of a movement in my life that changed me in ways that eventually let me let go of people who subtly and not so subtly sabotaged my life. I've yet to meet a person who claims to have completed every exercise in the book, but I have met many people who have benefited either personally or artistically from having read it. Read it and then re-read parts of it and work the exercises."

(that makes it sound like i have students hanging around me and in my life at all times instead of twice a year.) but here it is, a teaser for this fine book: 1. first thing in the a.m.--before you even get out of bed--grab your handy notebook and pen and write three pages WITHOUT STOPPING OR THINKING. you are not doing writing writing. you are not to read it back (well months from now, ok.) just get it out and forget it. you might come up with a new screenplay idea. you might trash your cousin indigo because she ruined your marriage or spileld that starbucks on your dress. whatever.

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'd like to begin this review by acknowledging the fact that this book seems to have helped a lot of people connect to their creative selves, and for that reason I am glad of its existence. My experience with this book was multifaceted, but ultimately very unpleasant. I did take the program very seriously: up until Week 9 I completed the exercises and morning pages as prescribed (although it took me a year-and-a-half to do so). I've read on here many people describing this book as pseudo-psychological, self-centered, spiritual bullshit. Let me just say that I can definitely see why these claims were made. Cameron is very prescriptive and preachy, writing often in the collective ""we."" For example, from page 165 in Week 10, ""Blocked, we know who and what we are: unhappy people. Unblocked, we may be something much more threatening--happy."" Don't even get me started on the atrocious black-and-white sentiment here. What bothers me so much about this approach is her assumption that everyone is simply on the same page as her, with the same privileges, experiences, and emotional backgrounds. I don't care that it was written in the early '90s; not once does she mention how class, race, or even gender may affect one's access to creative modes and spaces. To Cameron, the only things standing in the way of reaching your True Creative Self are your friends and family members--at one point she urges you to label them as ""Wet Blankets""--and your lack of faith in god. For someone whose creative ""success"" seems to be almost exclusively tied to The Artist's Way franchise, she has an awful lot of rules and self-assurance that her ideas about creative living are inarguably True. It's been said that she modeled this program after the AA 12-step program. I do not deny that 12-step programs are effective and life-saving for many people--just that they're not for everyone. Cameron's adaptation of 12-step philosophies to creativity is a little extreme, in my opinion. She treats creative expression as a life-or-death matter, and unfortunately I internalized her opinions as facts for some time. And again, she never mentions structural issues like systemic racism, capitalism, or differing values that may impede one's ability to be a flourishing creative angel. The morning pages were helpful for me for awhile until I realized I began to ruminate more than I was clearing my head. I do love the idea of the ""artist's dates,"" though, and will definitely try to incorporate these into my life more frequently. In short, I do not recommend this book. If you are interested, I suggest reading it with a healthy dose of skepticism. Don't let her bully you into believing your life isn't full and beautiful unless you're creating masterpieces on the daily."

While there are some really magical sentences in here, it just isn't worth the slog. This book was written for a very specific person: someone who has spent their life in a corporate atmosphere, who has a lot of extra cash, and thinks they maybe want to try being creative. I was willing to look over this, but other things kept getting in my way from taking anything the author wrote to heart: • Name dropping. So much name dropping. I honestly do not care. This is not why I am reading the book. • She suggests you buy your way to creativity. In the sense of: go on vacation! buy some watercolors! take a day off! There is so much privilege assumed by this author that it is unnerving. • Advice that contradicts itself. This doesn't really happen until week 10, but still. Annoying. • The thought that if you don't like or spark with any of the tasks she demands, then that means you just aren't pushing through and/or doing it right. Nah, eff that. Different people learn different ways. • That everyone wants to be creative in order to make money from their art. What about the folks who just want to play an instrument as a hobby for themselves or paint on the weekends as an excuse to get out in nature? Not everything has to be commodified. In the end, I'm glad I read this book so that no one can ever recommend it to me again. I am sure that this content was very helpful to many people and kudos to you. For me, the values seem a bit dated and it just makes me angry and tired."

I figured, why not. As an aspiring writer, the book, definatly had some appeal, but kind of lost me as I progressed through it. It's obviously written for people who are not 'artists' per say, but would like to be. The first chapter was about overcoming mental obstacles (like being afriad that you'll become poor and get AIDS from being an artist...). It's also a very kind of spiritual 'new age' type of books, i.e. Art is from God and it flows through you, you are a beautiful vessel, etc... Regardless, each chapter gives you different exercises to do for the week, to become more creative and open yourslef up, some are good, and some are kind of ridiclous. The hardest thing the book challenges you to do is write at least 3 pages a day, free writing, by hand, right after you wake up. Which was suprisingly hard. I struggled for the first month, but after that I enjoyed actually writing every day. I don't actually do the morning pages anymore, but would start them up again later. It wasn't a complete wash, but the book wasn't really written for people who studied creative writing in college."

I think I've made some choices in my life that, in hindsight, I might not have made had I not had experience with this book. I think that's what is great about this book. Whether you make it through every chapter or not, there is something meaningful to take away from the writing prompts, ""morning pages,"" and playful, creative exercises ... and to this day, I have a much better outlook in general when I make a point of taking myself on an ""artist's date."" (To those who are in the middle of working through the book on their own or with a group ...

However, once you go past the useful ideas of morning pages and artist dates, you just end up with a white privileged woman’s interpretation of monotheistic religion in a Judaeo-Christian vein with a thin veneer of 90s New Age and pop-psychology. Even though she insists the book can be used by atheists as successfully (as long as they accept the existence of higher power which lol) I honestly don’t see how. The whole thing is modelled after the 12 step program which is problematic in itself but that’s a story for another time. This was not for me because it felt like more than half the book talked about getting rid of the doubters and toxic people in your life. I genuinely don’t have such people in my life. All my friends and family are extremely supportive and believe in me more than I believe in myself and push me to put myself out there. I am my own worst enemy and Cameron gets to that (around chapter 8 I believe) but by that point I’d read a chapter about how you won’t be a starving artist because god will give you money as god loves artists and also likes to reward people with money, so I’m pretty much done with this book at that point. There is also a ton of bullshit about how universe will provide if you just want something and show up. This is all in vein of The Alchemist and The Secret and all other absurd nonsense, including Jung’s synchronicity. In general this was so violently at odds with my whole worldview it was difficult to weed out the useful tidbits from it. But I guess my worthwhile takeaway would be: show up, put yourself out there, make time and space to be creative and don’t marry that with “productivity”, because creativity needs rest and playtime to flourish. So in the end I gave this book merciful 2 stars."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Today I finished the 12-week program in this book for the 4th time. The first time, I joined an online group that went through it. The second time, I attempted it alone. The last two times, I went through it with a local group that I gathered and facilitated. Every time, I learn something new -- about myself, about creativity, about my hopes and dreams. Sometimes, I find the essays and tasks cheesy and dumb. Other times, they are exactly what I need at the time. When writers ask me to recommend a book to learn how to write, I recommend this one. It's not about writing at all, not really, but about unblocking creativity. It will step on all your toes and make you work hard and stop procrastinating, but it will feel fantastic if you follow through. It's not really a book to do alone, though. If you really want to get the most out of it, find some others willing to go through it with you. Sign the contracts and commit yourselves to finishing. It's better when you have people who will call you on your bullshit when you start wimping out. It's better to have people who will be there when you realize you're a terrible artist -- people who have seen your work and who can see the qualities that make you stand out. I can't speak highly enough of this book and this process. It's not really a book you just sit down and read. You have to put in the work to get the results. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes it's hard. But it's absolutely worth it."

I feel like I just had one of the best therapy sessions. I faced my fears, anger, jealousy, core negative beliefs, and childhood events all in 222 pages (in my edition). Not only did I survive the ordeal, I came out of it stronger. And wow, that was quite a spiritual journey and a deep one. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting to get as much out of this as I did. Most readers know about the Morning Pages concept. As soon as you wake up, you write 3 pages longhand, stream-of-consciousness style. I haven’t been able to stick with this, because I struggle to function in the morning, and I’m not waking up any earlier. I do enjoy journaling in the evenings before I go to bed. The artist’s date concept was a lot of fun. For two hours every week, you do whatever fun adventurous or creative thing your inner child wants to do. Some of that deep stuff I mentioned was difficult, but it was so beneficial. I already knew that fear was my biggest creative block, but it was nice getting that confirmation. Now I’m convinced that I can face my fear. Now I’m learning to focus on the creative journey — the creative process — not the length of the trip. My favorite parts of the book were how Julia Cameron reframed anger and jealousy. She says that they’re maps that point you in the right direction if you learn how to interpret their messages. I really needed to learn this. I used to think both of those emotions were enemies, but Julia convinced me that they’re loyal friends that are trying to teach me important lessons. Of course, there are tons of affirmations and journaling exercises. What’s interesting is that she reinforced how important it is to trust your inner wisdom and your perceptions. I’ve been working on this recently, so reading about this at this moment, is what C. G. Jung calls synchronicity. Whenever I’d think or talk about my goals and dreams, I’d get hung up on “How?” Julia reminded me to focus on “What next?” in my plan and let the HOW work itself out. I wish I had read this book years ago, so if it’s still on your TBR, please don’t wait to read it and don’t rush through it when you do. There’s a lot to unpack in this book, and if you take your time, you’ll get more out of it. It’ll be worth it."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"From the beginning of the year been insanely busy - emphasis on “insane” - with all the preparation and marketing involved with the Huntress series, relaunching Huntress Moon and Blood Moon and launching Cold Moon with Thomas & Mercer in a rollout over just five months. But that’s not all there’s been to it. The last part of last year was really hard, in a professional sense. The delays in the release of Cold Moon made me anxious and depressed. At the same time that I was grappling with that, I committed myself to a complete overhaul of before taking it to print - and ended up doubling the material in the book. I’m thrilled with the result, but it took time away from my fiction writing and stretched me more thin than is really healthy for me, or anyone for that matter. Also, I’m writing Book 4 in the Huntress series and I seem to be writing three different books at once, which, while it is probably exactly the process I need to be going through, is also hugely confusing. And oh yeah – I started Book 1 of a new series set in Scotland and in LA. All of this while I have been adapting to life in a new country. That marginally speaks English, but not always. Especially after a few pints. Are we starting to get what’s wrong with this picture? It was time to stop the madness and reassess. The good news is, I didn’t have a complete nervous breakdown. The better news is, I knew how to heal myself. Some of you may be familiar with Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way – a classic on creativity, spirituality, and recovery. It’s a twelve-week program sort of based on twelve-step programs, but for artists and creativity. The Artist’s Way is a huge commitment. You do Morning Pages every day (three mandatory pages of free form writing) and an Artist Date every week, plus numerous assignments on top of that. This is what I decided to do on top of everything else I was doing. Crazy, right? But I knew I had to do something. Workaholism is a big problem for me. Let's be blunt - I get a lot of rewards from it. Certainly it pays off in a career sense – it’s kind of the job description for a screenwriter and pretty much for an author, too, if you want to make a living at it. There’s another big payoff, too. When I’m insanely busy I don’t have to think about myself much. Or at all. But you know…. that’s maybe not so great. The Artist’s Way is designed by someone who has had all those issues and knows the score, including all your sneaky little tricks. The first time I did the program, I didn’t make it all the way through the twelve weeks. I rarely did the Artist Date. I openly scoffed at and ignored most of the suggestions for fun stuff. And I certainly didn’t do some of the scary deeper work – like the week of reading deprivation. (Yes, that means an entire week of no reading. I know some of you out there just stopped breathing at the very thought). But even not doing it full out, the breakthroughs that happened for me at the time I was working the program and in the year or two after I did it were extraordinary. I finished Huntress Moon, decided to e publish it instead of going for another traditional publishing deal, and did it to big success. I got back all of my backlist of traditionally published books and launched those books as e books. I wrote my YA thriller The Space Between, and wrote a romance version of Screenwriting Tricks for Authors. I started teaching a college film class, which I loved. And, oh yeah - I met this guy This time through, the breakthroughs are already coming fast and furious. Sometimes I’m taking two weeks to do the work suggested for a week. Sometimes I’m skipping stuff. I put off the reading deprivation while I was doing copyedits, but I did it last week, a full week, and WOW. (I’ll write about that in a separate blog.). I already feel so much more aligned and focused. I can’t wait to get started with my day in the morning. In the midst of some pretty dangerous burnout, I am healing. It is an immense relief. So a huge thank you to Julia Cameron, for saving my skin - and soul - again. And for you all, some questions. Did you know about The Artist’s Way? (It’s not just for artists and writers. It’s for everyone. We’re all creative beings at our core.) Have you ever worked the program? Or is there some other way you’ve found to take stock and heal yourself in times of burnout? I’d love to hear!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm not one to ask for external recognition, but I'd be OK if you gave me a medal for completing not just this book, but the program! The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a how-to book -- specifically, how to overcome your creative blocks -- structured as a 12-week program. It's based on a popular workshop Cameron taught in NYC to help creative people recover their creative productivity and passion, so each week's ""lesson"" starts with a lecture (about 6-8 pages of content), is peppered with quotes from other creative people to inspire and cheer you along, and ends with a set of tasks for you to complete or not. I say ""or not"" because she says you don't have to do all the exercises to reap the benefits of creative recovery, but there is still maybe something helpful in there for you if you do them. I also say ""or not"" because this isn't school, and no one will be there to make sure you do it all. I did not feel particularly blocked when I started the program in June. But there was a group forming to complete the 12-week program together, very close to my house, on the same day each week that is generally good for me to meet. I also had a couple other ""signs from the universe"" that I should jump on board, so I did. The group was very diverse, with people from many walks of life, in very different phases of their careers and lives, some of whom are creative for a living and others who aren't. As the weeks went on, the group got progressively smaller. Several people said they wanted to ""re-launch"" their 12 weeks in the fall, but about 4 of us are seeing this cycle to the end. Having that peer group, to listen, to share things they got that maybe didn't initially resonate with me, to challenge and support each other -- what a wonderful bonus, IMHO. I'm so glad I for this group. The only real rule I put in place for myself was to do the Morning Pages exercise, which is 3 pages of writing about anything you want, every single morning. Actually, this is maybe Cameron's only rule for the program, too. In order to get maximum benefit, you've got to put in that minimum amount of effort. All the rest you can figure out and negotiate as you go along. I ended up filling a journal and running 2 pens out of ink before the 12 weeks was even over. There was something particularly satisfying about that... Cameron's writing style is a curious mix of common sense self-help, full-on new age spirituality, and gratuitous name-dropping. (FYI the book was originally published in 1992; my print copy looks like it is from 1996; and I bought the 10th anniversary Kindle version. It's the 10th anniversary edition that takes the name dropping from annoying to unbearable. If you don't like that kind of thing, just skip the introduction in the 10th anniversary edition.) Some weeks, I'd be highlighting like crazy and shouting, ""I know!!!"" at the pages. Other weeks, I'd just shrug my shoulders and just write whatever was on my mind. And it was still so helpful in so many ways. I feel not just more productive, and not just like I understand myself better, but also like I can manage my creative ebbs and flows more effectively. It's probably no coincidence that I found my sewing mojo again in the middle of the program. And the daily writing habit -- I never intend to let that go. It's been magnificent. The subtitle of the book is perfect: ""A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity."" But what isn't evident from the title or the subtitle is that this book isn't just for those in creative professions, or those with creative aspirations. If you are creating a life (which is most of us), this book is for you."

I mostly hated this book, though there were a few small things I got value from. Julia Cameron’s book feels hopelessly out of touch in 2020. This was the 25th anniversary edition, and it didn’t seem to have been updated at all to reflect modern times. Cameron also has this super aggravating way of looking at the world where she sees artists as inherently superior to all non-artists. I found myself rolling my eyes at that a lot. Her woo woo “creator”/spiritual stuff also got on my nerves and I couldn’t buy into it. She includes an abundance of quotes in every chapter like an eighth grader who just got a book of quotes from her grandma. Additionally, Cameron herself has a huge amount of privilege to live a lifestyle like this. She’s staring at idyllic mountains and scrawling morning pages, taking herself on artist dates, decorating her office, and living this chill life where all she does is create. Does she have any responsibilities?! I get that taking time for yourself is a good thing, but she seems downright selfish. The aspects I did like were the morning pages and the artist dates. Hard to take yourself on an artist date during a global pandemic, though! The morning pages are something I’ll try to keep doing moving forward as it’s a good way to take out the mental trash. Some of the tasks/questions each week were good journaling prompts, and it was a nice way to force myself to sit down and check in with myself, which I hate doing. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend this to others."

All of us except Ms. Cameron here, apparently. Now, there is a conversation to be had as to the treatment of art under capitalism, but, of course, that is not the conversation we had here. I really wanted to like this. A family friend of mine even went out of his way to gift it to me with a note discussing how much it changed his artistic life and hoping it would change mine. My dad even mentioned reading this when he was a poet in the 90’s. Alas, I hated everything beyond the most basic of basic premises of this guide. I agree that everyone can be creative. I agree that creativity can be a force for some people that strikes at random and feels like it flows through them. That’s…yeah, no, that’s it. She first lost me in the socioeconomic privilege of it all. You expect anyone who works and/or goes to school can set aside enough time to write three pages of essentially nothing a day. Mind you, these pages are utterly mandatory and quintessential to being an artist. Oh, and don’t forget how her success stories are from millionaires and rich extremely upper middle class people. Truly, the bourgeois and the elites. How, again, is this meant to be a universal guide for artists? Then it was quantity being more important than quality. Because, seriously? Apparently, god is supposed to make your work good, and it’s you’re responsibility to put it down on paper or whatever your art form may be. And…critics aren’t just jealous. The author is literally a critic! But when she does it, it’s fine, but everyone else’s criticism is invalid. Also, tell me you’re not marginalized without telling me you’re not marginalized : purposefully infantilizing yourself (and every other artist by extension) edition. Don’t worry, there’s more! Look, I get it was the 90’s, and people didn’t have any respect for disability, and eating disorders, or anything in the 90’s. But do we have to compare having an artistic block to anorexia? Or say that artists choose to have a block because being a “crippled artist” generates sympathy? Shit, man. Have a little tact."

Who should read it: People who don't realize they're drinking kool aid. The only thing I liked about this book was the practise of writing every morning, but there was so much that I didn't like that came up frequently enough that I decided to stop my progress through it. The #1 thing that turned me off was that it was geared towards people with things and money- at several points Cameron suggests helping ones 'inner artist' by buying things, or setting up an 'extra room' (what's that now?) as an art den. It's restricting and, as I don't remotely worship money or materialism, unappealing. The #2 thing that turned me off, as I am an atheist, was all the talk about God. She says at the start not to let it get in the way, but it really does, and it's unavoidable. She says you can replace God with any other spiritual force, but that's no good for an atheist; plus she gives God motivations, so... Yep, not sold."

Then she goes into luxury chapter where she rumbles about not denying ourselves a luxury in terms of buying something we have been wanting for a long time and writes how she bought herself a horse! While on the next page she goes about her friend who likes raspberries which she always considered to be too expensive to buy. This is just some examples of her non-logical absurd 12 step program that is in my opinion overly religious, repetitive (she goes on and on with the same sales speech for morning pages and inner child rubbish), annoying examples, useless name dropping, ridiculous metaphors and horrible disturbing vocabulary.

Kindle Edition. I learned to turn my creativity over to the only god I could believe in, the god of creativity, the life force Dylan Thomas called “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower.” I learned to get out of the way and let that creative force work through me. I learned to just show up at the page and write down what I heard. Writing became more like eavesdropping and less like inventing a nuclear bomb. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. xviii). Penguin Publishing Group.

Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 2). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. When people ask, “Why do we write morning pages?” I joke, “To get to the other side.” They think I am kidding, but I’m not. Morning Pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods. Above all, they get us beyond our Censor. Beyond the reach of the Censor’s babble we find our own quiet center, the place where we hear the still, small voice that is at once our creator’s and our own. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 12). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. But what exactly is an artist date? An Artist Date is a block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist. In its most primary form, the Artist Date is an excursion, a play date that you preplan and defend against all interlopers. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 18). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In filling the well, think magic. Think delight. Think fun. Do not think duty. Do not do what you should do—spiritual sit-ups like reading a dull but recommended critical text. Do what intrigues you, explore what interests you; think mystery, not mastery. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 21). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. Give yourself permission to be a beginner. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 30). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

This is a book that has given me true permission to recognize my own creative genius and to realize that it is NOT too late to become the artist I might have been. Julia's writing voice is divine, she speaks gently but she puts her brilliant ideas out there firmly, because she knows they work and she wants you to believe that for yourself. This book is NOT for the painter, the poet, the musician and the potter. This book is for all of us because the simple premise behind is says we are all meant to be artists in life, and artist is defined by using your imagination and your creative genius and finding an application to life - whether that's a hobby, an outlet, or a full-blown business does not matter, and art is way beyond our cultural definition of art. Julia is brilliant at explaining this and that is why you, my dear, must read this book. Whatever industry or line of work you may be in, this book is about healing your inner artist and about valuing your own silly creative wonderful and hidden art. I LOVE the morning pages, the date with yourself, and all the other exercises at the end of the chapters. This is a book you must own. I borrowed it from the library first but had to have my own copy. And it is precisely for you if you use that awful awful phrase ""Well I'm just not that creative!"" Argh. Never say that about yourself, ever! You have a creative genius inside and this book lets you release it. One of my all-time favorite beloved books. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Julia Cameron, for this gift that will keep giving for years."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This has been an important book in my life for the past 10 years. I have gone through the process 4-5 times.I believe the book is extremely valuable for anyone who wants to have more creativity in their life, including such non-""artistic"" pursuits as creative problem solving, creative parenting, etc. I have experienced and seen others experience great results. There are some very difficult moments, especially in Chapter 8-9 when the rubber hits the road and you are asked to name your goal and how you are going to get there. It's easy to turn away at that point. Don't. Just take a chance. I'm convinced that the best way to do the program is to do it as a group with a good facilitator. Otherwise it's very difficult to pick yourself up and keep going when you inevitably fall behind. And while it's opposing what Cameron herself suggests, I do believe the facilitator needs to have a different role than the other members of the circle, to keep the group organized and to plan how the work will get done. That said, it's critical that the facilitator also be doing the program him/herself and act as a facilitator, not a know-it-all teacher. Final piece of advice-- get yourself a notebook and do all the exercises in it. The format where some exercises are in the book and some are suggested at the end leads to too much scattered, imporant work. You need to be able to look back over and see what your answers have been telling you."

Funny how when you first look at a book it is just a piece of wood or paper, and then after you read it, it becomes this representation of an immense thing of something wonderful. When I first heard of this book, the reference to Spirituality in the subtitle, 'A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity' put me off and I imagine may put some others off as well. To some 'Christians' the reference to spirituality makes them think of new-age stuff they don't like, and maybe some of the 'spiritual' people or people of other faiths may think it may be too 'Christian', and maybe atheist's will put off by all of it. I think it is written to not give offense to all the groups mentioned and that anyone who is dealing with creativity can recognize that inspiration needs to be allowed in and recognized from whatever source it is. First I want to talk about how well written this book is. I collect quotes, the ones I enjoy and want to read over and over again. This book is so well written it makes me want to copy out almost all paragraphs to my list of favorite quotes. So much wisdom and deep thoughts. It is a book I want to read over and over. Second, it is so so practical to help a person be creative. One main focus is to break through blocks, and a lot of chapters are written to help a person hunt down reasons for blocks and break through them. The author prescribes reading one chapter a week and gives some tasks to do. I was doing that, one chapter at a time, but when the end was getting closer I wanted more now and to get through all. If a person wanted to read it through, they could easily go back and do one chapter at a time, or cherry pick chapters and recommended tasks. One of the first tasks is to write 'Morning Pages' every day, which are 3 pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness. I have been doing this and think it is sheer genius. For many, the missed step in the process is to start and bring something forth. Some part in us stops us from just letting the creativity flow. This process helps to get the flow going, to help analyze any things in our life that is blocking us, and to create writing which then helps us to keep the flow going to our other art or projects. I think it is a must have book for someone in a creative line of work, and for the rest of us, some outlet of creativity makes our life better. For this reason I would recommend this to everyone. Lastly, I see Julia Cameron wrote other books to follow this one. As this one is so full and seems so complete in covering everything, it makes me wonder if the others are rehashing what is in here. I will be interested in hearing others opinions and reviews on them."

I just realized that there's was too much about this book that didn't work for me for it to be worth my time. It might work for some people but if you have done any other work on yourself, if you have any sort of self-esteem and if you know how your emotions work. This is definitely a waste of time. I had problems from the beginning with the take on god and chapter 5 was all about that. If you don't believe in god the way the author does once you reach chapter 5 there is basically no other way for you to go around it and get the benefit of the chapter. I know it is said at the beginning that god can represent whatever you want just while you read the book telling you exactly what god is and was god wants for you and from you there is no way to brainstorm your way out of the religious gibberish. I tried I even read ahead chapter 6 and 7 and it didn't work. So yeah, I gave up. Another thing is that I don't need to be told what to do and not do by a control freak and I sure don't need to be more controlling toward myself to become a better artist. So many useless rules while all the dark side of the work on yourself was ignored and replaced by some work on your inner child. Yeah, true I would love to eat candy but I'll do that as an adult. I don't need to get something from my old room (which is on the other side of the world anyway) I can totally be happy with what I have at home. I don't need anyone's permission to do whatever I want. This book sort of stressed me out and writing this review about it, is sort of stressing me out too actually, so I'm just going to go and forget that I ever opened it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is chock full of New Age-y woo/dated pop psychology/AA-esque spiritualism, and even though I am working on being less of a cranky cynic I found it pinging my eyeroll instinct nearly constantly. That said, in spite of being a cranky cynic, I am discovering that my ~creative process~ is occasionally helped by a healthy dose of woo and spiritualism, so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I found the underlying thesis about creative process resonated for me, which is, it's worthwhile to pursue art because it's something that makes you happy and enriches your life, regardless of the outcome (even if you never ever sell a book or win an Oscar or whatever). (Contrast with the popular mindsets of ""art is a JOB, here is how I blogged 1k words every day to success"" or ""art is MISERY, just TEAR OPEN A VEIN AND BLEED ONTO THE PAGE"". Which, I mean, are both totally valid mindsets if they work for folks! They do not work for me.) The exercises were whatever, but I found the daily journaling and artist date practices to be useful/enjoyable, and I will probably try to keep them up."

The Artist's Way is designed to be worked through over 12 weeks. Because it was a library book, I did it in six. My friends had started the book a few weeks before me but I still think I finished first. The concept is to learn how to nurture your creative side and avoid creative blocks. I had picked up the book years ago but it didn't make an impression. I don't think I took it seriously. This time, I found I wanted to recommend it to everyone I know. Even though I did it in half the time and didn't quite do everything, I gave it a lot of effort. It's a great book but it's not perfect. I did notice that it had a way of bringing to light the weirdest issues. The first time I read it, I had a real problem with Julia Cameron's use of God. Looking back, that was a time I was working through my own issues of faith. A friend of mine has the same issue but she also took issue with Julia Cameron's use of twelve step programs. This was something that no one else noticed making us wonder where the issue for her lies. For me, I struggled with some of the more old fashioned wording. I am a woman in my thirties with a lot of future left. I struggled with Julia Cameron's questions like ""If it wasn't too late, I would...."" For me, it's not too late. I want to live in the now - not the past or the future. There's an issue there but I can't say what it is but it gives me something to explore. I read a number of reviews of this book and find that you really have to be in the right place for this book to be helpful and, sadly, it's a place of recovery. The book is designed to help those recover from their blocks but it's a hard place to pull out of. I can understand why - Julia Cameron wrote this as a substitute to her workshops. The problem is that a workshop is more supportive than a book. I can picture that people use the book alone without support of others. You need a sounding board and someone to hold your hand when it gets too tough. You need accountibility that just doesn't come with a book. I do recommend this book and have been contemplating using it to start my own workshops in my area but I don't recommend going it alone. Find other creative beings who want to work through it as well. It doesn't matter if they have blocks or not - there's still things to be learned. I start this book over (I bought a copy for my husband) next week and plan on working through it with my husband so that he can discover the tools to prevent creative blocks as he starts his own blogs and persues his own dreams."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I literally just created a new Goodreads bookshelf called ""Life-Changing"" so I could put this book on it. I started it about a year ago and quickly realized reading it wouldn't be enough.; I'd have to actually ""do"" it. It's divided into 12 chapters, each with tasks and assignments to help you manage your fear of failure and all the beliefs that do not serve us... Each chapter is supposed to be completed in one week and I slowed the process waaaay down at times (hence it took me nearly a year to finish) but I figured doing it slowly would be better than not doing it at all. (And yes it's kind of 12-step-y and yes, the author has struggled with addictions and there's totally a let go and let God AA aspect to it, but whatevs, it works!) Even when I wasn't completing the tasks laid out in each chapter (like the three months when I did not open the book one single time, when my kids were on summer break) I was consistently doing my morning pages (about 4-5 times a week) and my weekly ""artist date"" (though if I'm being honest I do that on a monthly basis). The basic idea behind this book is that the universe's (or God's) gift to us is creativity. By using that creativity, we are giving a gift back to the world (or God). And by not only doing the assignments (most of which are fun) but by showing up on a consistent basis to journal first thing in the morning for three pages and take yourself on a ""date"" each week, you're optimizing your creativity. For me, that means writing, but for others it could be painting, theater, building a business, cooking, anything creative at all. Anyway, this book has changed my life. Here's how: -My dream gig literally fell in my lap two days after I finished the book. (Could be a coincidence but according to Cameron, it's more likely an example of divine synchronicity and you can say it's wackadoodle new age but I'm a believer). -My pitch acceptance rate went from 5% last year to 23% this year. (As a freelance writer, one ofthe ways I get work is by coming up with ideas for stories and ""pitching"" them to editors.)Mostly editors ignore them, occasionally they say no thank you, and when I'm lucky I get a yes and I can write and sell a story. I've heard 10% is a normal pitch acceptance rate but I have no way of verifying this.) -My income from writing more than doubled -I wrote for a dream publication for the first time (Runner's World) -I broke into four other new publications for the first time -I got my first $1/word assignment (big pay bump!) -I broke into two sections of the Washington Post that I'd never written for previously -One of my stories went viral -One of my essays got nasty, hateful comments (stung at the time but I feel like strangers taking a moment to hate on your work indicates a measure of success, or at the very least an audience that's wider than my mom and my husband. Is that weird?) -I was invited to join a writing critique group To be totally transparent I also started working with a business coach about a month after I started the Artist's Way and it's hard to say where the coaching ends and the Artist's Way begins. I have to give my coach a lot of credit, too. However, there are a few positive changes I can credit exclusively to this book, including: - I've kind of become a morning person. If you're going to get up early enough to write 3 longhand pages before you get interrupted, you have no choice but to get up with the birds. It feels SO good to have this quiet half hour as my morning ritual. Even if I only have time for a page or two I still enjoy the quiet time to dump the random contents of my brain onto the page. It makes me feel really grounded and helps me get in touch with what I really think/want/feel. -I love the ""permission"" the Artist's Date gives me to do things that are not necessarily productive... Some of my artist's dates have included a dance class, go to a favorite coffee shop and eat a muffin, write a letter, go for a hike, draw, and working on an art project."

It's only a few pages, and I think it's the quickest way (much faster than reading reviews) to garner if this author's way of thinking is for you. Then, if you do decide to read it, . ""The Artist's Way"" is really a workbook that entails a three-month long process that will likely end up taking longer than three months (it took me four months). It's simply not the kinda thing you can get through on borrowed time. Finally, do commit to this process alone. I never would've made it to the end without my creative accountability partner, who showed up for every step of the process alongside me. Even if you have to sign up for a virtual book club to meet this requirement, do it. If I didn't have some serious criticisms of this text, I'd be rating it five stars. In fact, I think it's the first book I've rated lower than five stars and also shelved under my ""favorites"" and ""need to re-read"" categories. Can you already tell you're in for an erratic, ambivalent ride in this review? I read this book's introduction many times since purchasing it but didn't take the plunge to commit to the process until the beginning of March/April-ish this year. I just finished reading the book tonight, because it's not a regular self-help book. It's basically a guided self-help course. If you don't accept that, if you treat it like a regular book, . If you're a creative who is content with the current state of your creativity and you're just curious what all the fuss is about, ; you won't get the fuss! What makes this book so powerful is that Cameron has written for a audience here - . If you're rolling your eyes at that, I promise you will shelve this one DNF, so don't bother. If by this point your ears are perked with intrigue, then you feel the way I did discovering this book and re-reading its introduction over and over. I was so scared to sign the ""contract"" that marks the commitment to begin the process. My advice, in addition to the advice already given, is please, do NOT let fear stop you. Before I committed to process, I self-identified as a writer and as a creative person, but the following quote truly sums up how those identifications manifested in the day to day of my life: After four months, I am writing as a habit everyday. I'm reading more. I've picked up abandoned hobbies again, like walking, crafting, and photography. I've started new hobbies like nature hiking. I've had spiritual breakthroughs, physical breakthroughs, mental breakthroughs, creative breakthroughs. I've identified as ""spiritual but not religious"" ever since I left Christianity, but now I could speak to you in concrete terms about what that means to me, personally. I feel committed to my health more than ever before, especially my mental health, and have accepted things about it that I spent my entire life up to this point running from. I've started writing poetry again, and not just as a way to work through trauma, but as a way to describe a flower, or myself at rest. I started submitting my writing for publication again. I got to this point over four months through the following process: - Cameron calls these morning pages. I wrote them at anytime of day, and am still struggling to get them done in the morningtime but, after much rebellion and finally resignation, I I feel best when they are done first thing. Yes, I missed days. No, I wasn't perfect. Some days all I wrote was how much I hated writing. I kept at it. It's a habit now. Now the pages nag at my mind until I've gotten them out, even on the difficult days. - This included doing some in-chapter journaling prompts. Some weeks I pushed it off, into two weeks. That's why it's taken me four months to finish. - I usually ended up working on both tasks Friday evenings. The most difficult tasks were the ones that required something from me everyday, or made me write about my trauma. Some tasks had me in tears, others made me joyful. I honestly don't know how some people do every single task listed every week. Godspeed. - Cameron calls these artist's dates, and I skipped them the most out of everything. I think I would have more creative work to show for myself if I hadn't. It's the biggest area of improvement I've identified for myself, and Cameron is correct that it's mostly fear that has me continually skipping out on them. So you can see, it was a lot of work that I wasn't perfect at, but I did it. Seeing this process through to the end is one of my biggest accomplishments this year, especially the daily journaling habit. I highly recommend this book, because it sparks real change. With that being said, I am disappointed that the 25th anniversary edition my partner was reading had zero changes from my 10th anniversary edition. This book was written in the 90s and it shows. It's privileged, ableist, and infuriatingly redundant in its narrow-mindedness. There were entire chapters, especially in the second half, that made me angry enough to exclaim and put the book down. Cameron's ego believes process can pull everyone into happiness out of the harshest poverty, the most clinical depression, and the strongest addiction. When this belief comes through in her writing, it comes off as tone-deaf to reality. Her advice to people in the worst circumstances is the exact same as her advice given to people in the best circumstances, and that is this book's most glaring flaw. As someone who went through this process while battling some deep dark mental health shit, let me tell you that this book is NOT the magic cure to diagnosable mental health conditions that Cameron implies it is. However, the process encourages reflection, growth, and healthy relationships. The morning pages alone are probably priceless to someone seeking help from a therapist and/or psychiatrist; they allow you to better communicate your issues to others, because they've forced you to write about them already. So put the bad advice into perspective, the way I did. If the text feels problematic enough to keep you from the process, then stop reading it, and just keep with your morning pages, artist's dates, and weekly tasks. The process is worth it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"https://pricelesseconomics.wordpress.... As a child, English and writing were chores. I was forced to submit assignments at school and university but this was merely a means to an end. When I entered the working world I joined a research house, writing commentary each and every day. The red ink on my edited work identified that my ability to express myself in the written form was holding me back and I was forced to improve. Over time I realised that the art of writing is an important element in developing well-constructed thoughts. The difference between presenting to clients before writing a research report and presenting after is chalk and cheese. Writing allows one to digest, reflect and critique ones one work. I’ve tried to maintain and improve the skill ever since I made this connection. I mentioned this process to a friend and he recommended Julia Cameron’s The Artist Way to me because it forces one to write every day for 3 months. I didn’t quite appreciate how profound a journey it would become. ArtistsWay_pic I love the way in which Julia Cameron links creativity, spirituality and love. I’m not a religious person but I’ve long believed that we are all spiritual beings, that there is a portion of our brains or psyche that responds to or requires a spiritual connection, a belief in something bigger than our self. Many people express this need through religion but it could also be expressed through a belief in people, community or nature. I think this spiritual characteristic exists because we are social creatures with imagination and the ability to have a profound impact on each other, both positively and negatively, influence and to have a greater impact as a collective. I’ve developed this idea in my own head through my growing understanding of the impact of positivity. When we enter into interactions with the world that have positive intentions, positive thoughts and use positive worlds, the returns back to us could be exponential. Professionally, I’m an incredibly analytical and sceptical person because these are critical skills in order to seek the truth and research complex subjects. Reconciling the power of positivity with analytical scepticism is really tough but it is rewarding. Positive thoughts don’t work in every case and they cannot be relied on to achieve anything in particular. Being a selfless exuberant martyr could work for some, but that’s not what I’m advocating at all. I think a primary focus on the self is imperative towards constructive human interactions. Paraphrasing Jordan Peterson, “get your house in order before you start telling others what to do.” Positivity is also no substitute for core success skills like hard work, purposeful action, learning, asking questions, execution, etc. Being positive without taking action might make you happier but it isn’t going to take you very far. That being said, there are so many people out there in the world who can and are willing to help us on our way. Often the journey is much more colourful and beautiful when others are walking the journey with us. People love positive people and are far more likely to help someone with a positive outlook on the world as opposed to someone who is eternally grumpy and blaming others for their negative outcomes. Looking for the positive in a situation not only cheers you and those around you but it can lead to real solutions as you tend to look forward and think about what you can do to solve the problem at hand. A positive outlook, belief in other people and a constructive outlook have the ability to create numerous unintended consequences, what Julia Cameron calls “synchronicity.” Coincidental interactions. When we unexpectedly meet someone who can help us with our challenge, when we read an article that can help the person we spoke to yesterday, when we bump into an old friend that has just solved the very problem we’re drowning with… Positivity raises the probability of synchronous interactions. Through being positive, believing in the ability of others, creating connections and loving the people we make contact with we have the ability to create better outcomes – what is more spiritual than that! Thinking of creativity in this spiritual way deeply resonates with me. Historically, I would have always thought of creativity in the traditional sense. Artists, painters, writers and dancers are creative. Over time I have challenged this notion – initially through my wife who is a traditionally creative person. She taught me the power of fostering creativity and made me realise that creativity exists in all of us. Her love for dancing, theatre and just general expression of emotion triggered this process through our relationship. Julia Cameron really rammed home those connections. The book is primarily targeted at “traditional creatives” but a small amount of lateral thinking allows anyone to apply the principles to their lives. Creativity can find expression in a boring corporate job. Of course, not to the same extent as an artist but there are areas where all of us can create better outcomes. Yes, traditional activities like painting, drawing and dancing are great to trigger creativity but I’m certainly not advocating that everyone takes up a dance class. A lawyer could be more creative in the way she involves juniors, presents information, teaches colleagues and challenges outdated laws, for example. There doesn’t need to be a linear connection between the creativity and the goal someone is trying to achieve. In fact, belief in non-linear connectivity is probably required to really benefit from creativity because the benefits of involving a junior, for example, won’t be visible initially. But who knows who the junior might become, what clients they could bring in or just the gratitude they might express, which could warm your heart and push you forward. Investigating the creativity in what we do, even if it seems completely uncreative, allows us to investigate the true goals, the underlying intentions and create much more meaningful and rewarding outcomes for ourselves and others – is there a more noble outcome than that? Targeting goals without fully appreciating the intention risks generating hollow outcomes. As with anything interesting, meaningful, or powerful, the concept of creativity is tricky. Being creative and avoiding linear thinking doesn’t negate the need to generate goals and beeline towards them. The most successful people are goal orientated with priorities and to-do-lists but implementing these techniques doesn’t imply consistently linear thinking and surface level appreciation of first-order implications. The Artists Way has encouraged me to write even more than before. Apart from reaffirming the importance of writing in creating well-constructed analytics, it is fascinating to observe one’s personal thoughts on paper every day. It is a meditative and self-reflective process that allows one to notice one’s thoughts, investigate their causes, explore one’s strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies to enhance and counter them. I’d highly recommend The Artists Way but it’s much more than a book. It’s a spiritual journey of self-discovery that is likely to be very different depending on each person."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Short review: this is a bunch of nonsense. As in, it makes no sense. For the most part, I could not take it seriously and it creeped me out more than a little bit. And annoyed me a lot. Really long review: I only followed through on reading this whole book so I could, with a clear conscience, justify my analysis and conclusion that this book is mostly terrible. Honestly, I’m surprised this book has endured in what I assume is close to its original form for so long. The author flits from idea to idea, melding together a vast array of concepts and skimming the surface of many philosophical and self improvement topics. She goes from prayer to the law of attraction to setting boundaries and so on. As a result, there is no real cohesiveness to her message. It comes across as mumbo jumbo nonsense even though I think there are some good things hidden in there somewhere. But they are buried amongst a lot of completely absurd things. It’s written as a twelve week recovery program, but I don’t know what we are supposed to be recovering from. Mostly, I think it’s supposed to be creative block. If so, it seems pretty unfair, unreasonable, and unhealthy to pin that on ourselves. Especially as most of the book refers to outside factors as the source of creative block. But then, Cameron says “creativity is a spiritual issue” (week five, p. 93). So if we aren’t creative, is she really saying we need to recover from a lack of faith? This sounds a lot like evangelizing to me. What actually is the agenda here? To convert the reader to a particular belief system? Even if that is the case, it seems unreasonable to suggest someone can “recover” from something so abstract. However, Cameron frequently refers to people following the artist’s way as “recovering creatives,” which suggests that creativity itself is the “bad” thing. It just doesn’t make any sense. She probably means you want to recover your creativity, but then shouldn’t it be “recovering blocked creatives ?” She does sometimes use the noun “blocked creative” interchangeably with the noun “recovering creative.” Maybe I’m getting caught up in semantics but…it’s a book, so the words matter. And using the concept of recovery for whatever goal she is trying to achieve is at the very least misguided but potentially very harmful. She is not a mental health professional, claims no mental health training, yet is handing out assessments and advice with the air of authority that it’s justified because people have told her it works. She is telling the reader “if your creativity is blocked, this is why and what you have to do to unblock it.” She jumps from “here’s what worked for me and people I know” to “this will will work for you” without hesitation, drawing a direct line from mental health to creativity with no focus on the individual. Most unsettling to me, though, is the hypocrisy in the very idea of having a rigid instruction manual for how to be creative. The author offers numerous anecdotes of the many people she has helped and who regularly thank her for improving their lives (notably many of these are identified as millionaires who had to manfully set aside their music to learn the business with grandfather). I suspect these were people who wanted to be told what to do and she was happy to take on that role. It’s almost cultish. Or like a restrictive diet. She is taking a good thing way too far - exploiting unhappy or unfulfilled people with promise of creative breakthrough but only if you do exactly what she says and then she takes credit for any self improvement you achieve. She is saying you are broken and only she can fix you. Or perhaps it’s more accurate to say she credits the process she has developed. She even ridicules any doubt that might arise in giving full credit to her process. And at one point she insists that there be no reading AT ALL - with the glaring exception of her book, of course. It came across as predatory and any good insight she might offer was far overshadowed by the feeling I was being taken in by this book. Taken into what, though, I never figured out. It seems very audacious to claim a complete causal connection between the following “the artist’s way” and increased creativity. Can it be useful and helpful? Probably, if you want it to be. The one good takeaway for me are some useful writing prompts. But is this secret only key to unlocking success? No. And in the long run, I think following this advice would do much more harm than good. The irony is there is a whole section about how discipline will not bring creativity. Wait, what? Isn’t this whole book about discipline- a rigid process that must be followed exactly? Well, see, you still have to do the morning pages every single day and the artist date every week and every other assignment exactly on schedule, but you must do it “enthusiastically.” It shouldn’t feel like a chore even if you do it reluctantly or hate it while doing it and want to stop. So if this process doesn’t work for you, you must not have been enthusiastic about it. How convenient. Other reviews cite this as being too “new agey” and pushing a spiritual agenda. It is right there in the title. For me, this aspect was actually a source of humor. Yes, she unreservedly refers to God the Creator, and the book is very Jesus-centric despite her assurances that she doesn’t really mean God. But she presents her ideas in such a scrambled way that nothing actually makes enough sense to be either insightful or offensive. Overall, I can’t be certain what point Julia Cameron is trying to make, but I am certain that she gives me the creeps. I don’t necessarily think or know this book/process/author is malicious, but something just doesn’t sit right at all with me. I think it bothers me that this is a source that people who are really struggling will find and listen to and continue to suffer because there is very little that is useful here. There is a lot of blame placing in this book. A book that suggests READING is a self-destructive behavior. No thank you Ms. Cameron. The artist’s way is not for me. If reading is wrong, I don’t want to be right."

Run, don't walk, people... If you're open to it, this book will kickstart a super important journey whether you think of yourself as an artist or ""creative"" or whatever, or not. Julia gives you tools to stay awake to your dreams, stay creatively alive, and be patient with the unfoooolding path. This book is not perfect, and it's not a magic bullet. The Q is, are you ready to take the worthwhile risk of giving your inner artist/child a more legitimate seat at the table?! Julia can help you do it. P.S. - A major tenant of this book is that God loves creativity. We need to stay alive creatively, sometimes it's hard, and He actually does want to help. Julia talks about God quite a bit. She's a bit vague in her concept of God. Regardless of where you are coming from, it is likely the book will stir the pot, bring up questions. It was helpful for me to process a couple of these things with trusted friends. In reality, I don't think these are questions to be afraid of at all. If you are following Jesus, it will likely give you a lot to talk with him about. He'll go there with you. *IF you have read this and want to talk about it I am AVAILABLE* Hugs, a recovering creative person"

Many of the ideas are practical, such as the morning writing and you-day, and many good points made about strength, addiction, ill-intentioned allies. Etc. But there is a lot of proselytizing which is not my cup of tea (I don’t believe in any of that stuff) and there is also some magic thinking (such a writing contracts with yourself, making affirmations, etc.) with the “guarantee” that what you need will fall on your lap, or “God will provide”. I recommended this book to a few of my religious friends who like The Secret or laws of attraction type stuff but for myself I think there are more practical books out there for drowning artists lol."

I say ""rediscovering"" because most children at some time have a natural ""bent"" toward some creative outlet ( painting, writing, sculpture, acting, etc.) that is encouraged in adolescence. Yet when it's time to choose our profession, it's no longer socially acceptable in some way, so we are urged towards more ""appropriate"" careers. Anyway, it's almost like a psychology books because of the information about trauma, family impact, attachment, etc. Every chapter has exercises at the end to solidify the material. A guide in the front of the book suggests reading a chapter a week and working through the exercises. This has jump-kicked my interest in drawing and writing again. It has made me realize that my talents are valuable even though I'm not celebrated, young and at the beginning of a career, or even good at what I draw or write ... yet. So many realizations and revelations to be found about yourself! I found myself in tears at especially poignant chapters to me. It was excellent! How have I never heard of this book before now?!?"

At the end of each chapter there were exercises which were to be completed before reading the next chapter. I did not do the exercises so really can’t comment on whether this works or not. This book is definitely more about doing the work then just reading through it. And that is the main difference with this book as compared to other self-help book."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book came so highly recommended that I felt compelled to buy it but it's a total waste of money. The notion that we ourselves are not creative but have to let God be creative through us and consequently that if we are not creative, then it is our own fault because we are blocked - come on. This blatant Christian propaganda and installs not only a dangerous way of thinking but it's also really offensive. Build an altar? Good grief! There are so many reasons why creatives may be unable to live their creativity to the fullest - financial or family commitments. If I sit and paint all day I make no money to pay my rent (not yet from my art anyway) - it's as simple as that. And yes, the pressure to earn money, so I can live indoors, affects my creativity. This book is patronizing new age mambo jumbo from 30 years ago and a great deal in this book is spent on the self-glorification of the author, which I find highly questionable. The notion that good luck will find you if you build an altar and let God be creative through you is irresponsible and downright harmful advice. Typical Christian propaganda - don't take any real action - be passive and patient and unblock yourself, God will make it happen, and if not, then there is something wrong with you. This makes me sick. Practical tips for Creatives: 1. Make sure you have enough money to live and if possible, save up enough to pay your bills for 3 to 6 months. If that is not possible try to set aside some time every day or every week. 2. Decide how you want to be creative and book a course, buy an actual artistic instructions book. For this do some research and find living successful artists, who publish books and courses, there is also a ton a free content available online. 3. Do the work. The time you spend on the exercises in this book could be time spent practising drawing or painting or sculpting or whatever you wish to do. 4. Artistic fulfilment and success come when you learn and practice and experience joy creating. That takes time and effort."

I was curious to see if it's really that good. I realized in the first chapter I'm not the intended audience, but kept reading it (despite it feeling like a chore), so I know whether to recommend it to other people. The book is written for a person who is severely creatively blocked - someone who hasn't been creating anything for months/years, or maybe never in their life. I'd say that for this type of person, many of the exercises would probably be useful. I personally know someone who started a new creative hobby while working through this book. (I'm not that person, and haven't been for many years, so I had no interest in doing all those exercises. Some of them did seem interesting though and I might do them if I ever get bored.) I was bothered by the mention of God on what seems to be every single page. Spirituality itself is not the issue, but the way Cameron constantly hits you over the head with God this and God that makes me want to avoid her other books because it's just so damn annoying. Cameron offers some advice on issues that even prolific creatives may struggle with, such as boundaries, releasing control over the outcome, the tendency for overwork, perfectionism, procrastination, etc. so my time reading it wasn't completely wasted. For this it gets 3 stars. I'd be careful about recommending this book to others without knowing a bit about their background and worldview. I feel this is one of those books that has to find you at the precise moment when you need it in order to be able to get the most value out of it. Those of us who missed that moment will probably just shrug and wonder what all the fuss is about."

I had read roughly half of them, and I totally agreed: Those had changed my life. On the list were several others that I had heard of, had wanted to read for a while, but had never gotten around to grabbing. Maybe because my mother died this past year, I was feeling that life was so finite, so brief, that I wanted to finally make a point of reading these books. On this list was ""The Artist's Way."" I grabbed a used copy at Half-Price Books, thinking I would save the money and also that if I liked it at all, I would be writing and highlighting it. Understatement of the year. I have tabs, highlights, markers, and have worn out the binding. It's absorbed coffee, tea, and tears. Cameron is not without her critics. Some find her a bit saccharine. I can see that, but I also can see someone who believes in what she practices. Her approach hit home with me enough to entice me to trust the process. And here I am, twelve weeks later, ready to take it to the next level. Perhaps the greatest wisdom I obtained from reading this book and working through the process is the understanding and belief that creativity is a process and art of its own reward, and I, despite almost a half-century of self-sabotage, am totally worth it. Not bad for a $7.99 purchase from the used bookstore."

Even thought I may not be in love with this book, and even if Julia Cameron took one or the central tools of her course, the morning pages, from Dorothea Brande's Becoming a Writer without having at least having credited her as inspiration, it works. ----------- First reading 2016. I've seen this book referenced by and , and finally decided to read it at a time when I felt very, very stuck in a very, very major rut. Nothing pleased, I was not capable of looking forward to doing anything. This book really helped. I did not notice any increase in my creativity (that was not the goal), but it was a great incentive to sit down and think about things that could give me pleasure or seem fun to do, to make travel plans - and then to actually start doing things that are on the list."

It requires much discipline and time to conquer the instructions in it. I put it on the shelf until this summer when I had the energy to do something for myself. I thank them, in my head and my heart every day. It is a work toward bringing out the creative ""genius"" in all of us. I got some connections to Jungian theories, which I appreciated very much, since I respected it as I was raising my children. It thought it was a nice commentary on life that my daughter turned around and presented me with a fabulous gift like this so many years later. I love how things are connected. This book enlightens the reader and also helps them deal with some of the challenges brought on by other people. One of my favorite quotes from this book is about anger: ""When people do not want to see something, they get mad at the person who shows them."" This is a great book that dissects us and shows us where to go from there."

Talking the chapter pages out with others in a group of 12 usually called your Tribe gives you more insight as to what parts can mean. To get the most out of this book is to also work out the exercises and not all will apply or seem to be helpful, but all should be looked at and tried in the way that might open new thoughts etc to you. It asked that you write three full pages daily for 12 weeks. It is like journaling but they call it Morning Pages to be done in the morning. I found even though I do not like to write in a journal that doing this writing as I got to that last page of writing every day Truths of my thoughts seem to just come out and clarity of though come through and that is what they say will happen. The longer we write meaning each day we WILL learn more about ourselves and our possibilities. Reading the book ..without.. doing the writing is really missing the impact of what this book can do for you... read but.. Write Your Pages!"

This book makes you think about art and life in a whole new meaning and way, and it truly makes me want to LIVE and write in fun, meaningful ways to take the world, even just my own little corner of it, by storm and never look back to the boring way I used to be. Yes, the author uses some terms and suggestions of activities that would fall into a “New Age” type of thinking, however her suggestions can easily be fit into a Christian worldview—I just wanted to point this out for anyone sensitive to this kind of stuff. If you’re struggling with your creativity, read this book. If you’d struggling with life, read this book. It’s really, truly amazing, and I know I will come back to it again and again and again for the rest of my life."

I quit so close to the end…But I read the last two chapters of the book tonight. This book/process made me think a lot (especially the morning pages when I was doing them consistently). There were lots of aha moments and I felt like some chapters seriously called me out. So overall positive experience. But some of Julia Cameron’s writing was way too god focused for me. Especially because she said in the beginning that you didn’t have to believe in god if you’re reading the book but then references god a TON in every single chapter and kind of expects you to believe in god. So that was not my favorite, maybe I should have expected that. She was also kinda preachy, which I guess she needed to be since she’s trying to sell this artists way process to the readers."

The best way to describe it is as a 12-week course on unblocking your own creativity through daily practices. By using this workbook, you commit to 2 practices - daily morning pages (writing 3 pages of thought streams everyday - I don't always manage to do it in the morning, aim to do it once a day) and weekly artist dates (where you dedicate quality one-on-one time with your inner artist through any activity of your choosing. For example, walking in a garden, doodling, buying coloured pens and using them, collecting shells - the key is to pay attention. This is has been a spectacular experience to understand myself better and to align everyday activities with what I value most."

I can't say I liked this, but I can't say I didn't either. It just didn't apply to me. It was a book-challenge book I had to read which is the only reason it appeared in my pile. So once I knew that this wasn't going to be helpful to me, I changed my attitude, and thought I'd look for positive messages. So, I realized it was a positive and encouraging message to those who feel like they are in a creativity rut. This review probably isn't helpful if one is trying to decide whether to read this or not. I can just say it was positive in a 'psychiatrist couch' kind of way."

While I find Julia Cameron to be very irritating and self-aggrandizing, she also presents some invitations into creativity that I embrace and welcome. Namely: artist dates, morning pages, contracts, and honoring Creativity as a freely flowing source in the world. Keeping a commitment to myself and this book helps me stay honest with writing, and coming up with creative artist dates this year was a welcome challenge. I plan to read this book again in 2021, will likely continue to grumble about JC, while also thanking her for the tools she offers."

I can’t recommend this book enough. Even if you don’t consider yourself a “creative” person (first of all, you should), you will benefit from reading this book—I promise. I bought this book on a whim, knowing very little about it; lo and behold, it has changed my life. I didn’t plan to buy it, just happened upon it in Daunt one day (and it was the last one on the shelf). I started the 12-week course in October, at a time when I was struggling to find a job, a place to live, and a general sense of purpose as a soon-to-be 25-year-old (i.e. a quarter-life crisis). I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I now write this, at the end of the course, with two good jobs, an amazing place to live, and a restored sense of creative purpose and fulfillment. None of that is an accident, and I believe most of it is due to the magic of this book. In October, I was stuck in a creative rut of paralyzing self-doubt and inaction. I knew that deep down, I wanted to pursue music more seriously, but I didn’t know how to get from point A to point B. My biggest fear at that time was the thought of performing my own music live—a professional milestone I knew was essential to any chance of success in a musical career, but of which I was utterly terrified. This may sound insane, considering I perform publicly all the time. But it felt (and still feels) completely different when it’s music I’ve written: I’m not only being judged for how well I sing but for how well I write, the contents of which are, of course, inextricably tied to who I am as a person. At the time I picked up this book, it felt impossible that I would ever get to a point where I could see myself doing that. I’m happy to say that by Week 10 of this program, I finally booked my first official gig performing my own music (happening later this year!). It may not sound like a huge accomplishment, but for me, it really was (is). That would not have been possible without this book. The morning pages have become my daily lifeline. What started as a laborious chore to sit and write 3 complete pages of stream-of-consciousness brain-dump became an absolute necessity to be able to get through a day peacefully. I now worry that I’m too reliant on the morning pages, but that’s another story… I literally never write Goodreads reviews, so I hope the mere existence of this one speaks to the quality of this book. Julia Cameron, I love you. Thank you."

That's a phrase oft said at Twelve Step meetings. And that's how I feel about this book. Julia Cameron alludes to her own participation in some sort of recovery program and borrows terminology from those programs, so it seems appropriate to use that phrase as a critique. If you're not familiar with this book, it's been around since 1992, and lots of people have used it some way. It's a twelve-week program that is supposed to cultivate your inner creativity. There are two basic tasks. One is the morning pages, three pages of stream of consciousness writing in a notebook first thing every morning. The second is a weekly artist's date, which is time you take alone to nurture your creativity. You could take a walk, have a picnic, go to a museum or cultural event, or lots of other creative things. These two hallmarks of the program are very enlightening. But this on top of reading the chapter and doing several other weekly tasks takes at least ten hours per week. I'm retired, so for me, this was a way to structure my time and find purpose. It was something like being in therapy, too, stirring up all kinds of memories and feelings. There's something very narcissistic about it all, though a Millennial told me that's a Boomer attitude. As for the actual book, the introduction and the epilogue are pretty good. The writing in the chapters in between is uneven with a lot of new age stuff and cliches. It also is really out of date as it was written before the digital age. One of the weeks, you're instructed not to read books. That was difficult for me, but many people don't read many books these days, consuming lots of digital media. I tried to limit podcasts, YouTube and TV, too. That made the exercise quite useful. Now that I've finished, we'll see what creativity lurks beneath. But overall, in spite of all the silly stuff, I'm glad I completed the program and hope to continue some of the practices."

When I signed on, I had no idea what I was signing up for. I saw “Artist”, thought, “I’m an artist! I’ll do it!” I had no idea it was a commitment of 2 1/2 hours every week for 12 weeks! Well, I did it. At the beginning, I thought, “This is so not me!” I still do. But it was an interesting road. The book has some interesting exercises throughout. Some I did, some I didn’t. I wrote the morning pages for quite a few weeks before I let that go. Although, not entirely. When I feel the need to express or work through something, I reach for the pages. The best part of this course? The women I met! Sixteen of us - different ages, different personalities, different cultures, different beliefs. And they have all been delightful. It’s usually difficult to make friends at this stage of life (60’s for me), but the majority of this group has planned to continue meeting at the library and beyond. I guess this really isn’t a review of the book. But if you pick it up, try to go through it with a group. I think it is more meaningful when you have others’ perspectives and beliefs."

I can see how it wouldn't work for some people, and I admit it's a bit ""woo""...but then, everything about my own fickle, mystical, illogical creative process is woo, and honestly I often felt like Ms. Cameron was addressing me and my own specific issues. Some people don't believe in writers block. Some people sit down and blast through words without flinching. Not me, my friends! Writing is a dance, and sometimes I feel like I was born to do it, and sometimes I'm just lying flat on my face on some desolate parquet floor that stretches on for miles, while in the distant clouds a tinny, slow-motion tango plays from invisible speakers. And then, inevitably, it starts to rain... So, yeah, pick yourself up, wring out your skirts and cummerbunds and start tap-dancing through that rain. If you slip and catch yourself, just pretend like it was part of the act. No one else will notice. I'm two weeks into my morning pages.

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Why I wanted to read this book: I don't even remember how I found out about this book, which is unusual for me. It's just kind of been at the back of my mind for a while. Someone may have recommended it to me. I may have just discovered it on my own stumbling upon books on the internet. But it sounded very good and many people have been changed by it, including myself. Ways this book changed me: 1. It helped me be much more honest with myself and aware of any little lies that I sometimes let into my system. 2. It made me think more about God as a coach who supports my dreams because he made me with them and sometimes pushes me towards them and reminds me of them with ""coincidences"" or what I like to call ""God echoes"". 3. Over and over again this book talks about how any kind of creativity is a leap of faith, bravery, confidence and how it's a spiritual practice. I would have to agree, because I've experienced creating music as a form of worship. 4. It helped me become more confident in my creative endeavors and get rid of any preconceptions that it doesn't matter. 5. It argues that everyone is meant to be creative, not just the NF types or special chosen ones. 6. Big big thing: In order to learn how to be a good artist, you have to give yourself permission to be bad at first. 7. Another big big thing: this book promotes self-love, which I think is very different than selfishness. Selfishness is unhealthy indulging in destructive self-deception that ends in actions that harm other people. Self-love is self-nurturing thoughts of encouragement and acts of kindness towards yourself (this can include naps). Because hey. People need love and healthier habits and sometimes we have to learn how to encourage ourselves. What this book is not: It is not a book that will tell you to ignore the world outside and other aspects of life in order to thrive in your creativity. In fact, this book highly encourages exercise, yoga/stretches, healthy relationships, healthy boundaries, and ""unnecessary"" hobbies that will make you a more fully rounded person. When I first started reading this book a few months ago - I gave myself room to spread it out into a few weeks longer than the prescribed 12 weeks - I was very excited because it sounded like the author was a Christian the way she talked about God, and I was excited for another reason. The exercises in it and ways of thinking reminded me of what another Christian minister, Dr Jim Richards, teaches about how what we believe highly affects everything around us. The more I kept reading this book though, the more it seemed that the author was talking more about a big energy source than a powerful being with a personality who wants a relationship with his children. However, she tries to make the book accessible to people of all backgrounds and not be preachy. One more thing. The preconceptions the author has about her audience are sometimes incorrect. Some of the exercises and questions in this book probably won't apply to you or your background. Having said those things, there is so, so, so much truth in this book that is valuable and that I've never seen in other books on writing (that includes Stephen King's book On Writing) and there's far less language in this one. I highly recommend it to any and all artists, especially anyone dealing with writer's block or creative insecurities. Take notes, think about it, talk to people about the ideas in it. It's one of those books you'll want to talk about with creative friends to confirm or disprove the ideas in it. Use the book in the way that is most helpful to you. Go read it."

But just in case you haven't found it yet, I'll write my review. This book charts a 12-chapter course to be executed over 12 weeks or more, to ""recover"" from an artistic slump. But it winds up being much more broadly applicable for finding one's creative fount for overall life rejuvenation. This book is the friend who encourages you to uncover the things you always meant to do, and make the space in your life for the unlikely, inexplicable things that uniquely make you happy and fulfilled. I'm still not someone who would describe herself as an artist, and yet artistic play and creativity are at the root of my joy and this book helped to reignite that."

This book has a few good tools and if you are struggling with discipline to work at your art then this book can help you with that. While this book contains practical tools like the ""daily pages"" and ""artist dates"" there is far too much fluff and unverifiable mumbo jumbo to recommend it to anyone. For example, There are also far too many second hand testimonials. For example, Just tell me why I should do the ""morning pages"". Tell me what they do for me! Don't tell me about some guy's (that may or may not exist) experience with your program. I've already bought the damn book! Following the ""Artist's Way"" in the book will help you if you are an artist and there is some good to come out of this book but the majority is just meaningless words meant for people who want to believe them."

I ended up pushing through anyway, because what else was there to do in lockdown other than try to rehabilitate my creativity, flippant and useless as that seemed at the time? I'm glad I did. The Artist's Way first caught my attention when I realized multiple artists across many mediums who I admired cited it as influential. I'm not sure it will be helpful to absolutely everyone and I remain puzzled as to how a book this blatantly spiritual and woo-woo has been found to be helpful by so many atheists and agnostics, but pushing past the Law of Attraction bullshit, Cameron has at the very least laid out a useful collection of exercises and probing questions that assist in investigating and pushing past creative blocks. I found much of the work I was doing aligned well with concepts and deeper questions I had already been asking myself in therapy. I think Cameron would refer to that as ""synchronicity"" rather than coincidence. I didn't consider myself to be an artist when I started this book. I still don't now that it's over. But I feel more free to engage in creative pursuits without self-criticism and that's exactly what I was hoping to achieve. I picked up the guitar again. I'm drawing little doodles simply because they amuse me. I'm writing programs in Javascript and designing woodworking projects for cat furniture. I'm making time lapse videos and memes and posting them on Instagram to my audience of <100 personal friends just because I feel like it. I'm having fun doing things I felt too paralyzed to even start a couple months ago. That's worth a lot in my book."

Because it looks like it. That is not to say that I agree 100% with every philosophy or idea in this book. It is to say that I've been able to take those ideas, bend-twist-modify and then use them to push forward my work as a writer (and artist?). The book promotes a general mindfulness that has had several helpful side effects for me - 1) It has helped me be kinder to myself 2) It has helped me turn emotions like sadness, helplessness and envy into actionable plans 3) it has helped me take the driver's seat through many occasions of anxiety and panic and ACTUALLY steer myself away 4) It has improved my relationship to food, especially in moments of stress 5) It has changed the way I see exercise and physical activity 6) It has helped me reengage with several passions I had as a child and some that I had let go off as an adult. I do have to add this disclaimer though - the book came for me at a time in my life when I was very ready and open to receiving this sort of guidance. So while some of the language and imagery can be very religious and God-oriented, I was able to be flexible and take that to mean what I needed it to mean in my life. I would still 100% recommend it to everybody in the WORLD, and only ask that you be open and receptive to modifying the ideas to suit your own concept of divinity."

This book deserves No.1 self-help book ever! A truly inspiring work helping you to look deeper into your self and leading you towards creative recovery. It is about finding and nurturing the child artist inside you. Although I liked the entire book, following sentences are worth remembering on this journey of self exploring: - To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong. There will be many times when we won’t look good—to ourselves or anyone else. We need to stop demanding that we do. It is impossible to get better and look good at the same time. - In order to move from the realm of shadows into the light of creativity, shadow artists must learn to take themselves seriously. With gentle, deliberate effort, they must nurture their artist child. Creativity is play, but for shadow artists, learning to allow themselves to play is hard work. - “If you want to work on your art, work on your life.” That’s another way of saying that in order to have self-expression, we must first have a self to express. That is the business of the morning pages: “I, myself, feel this way . . . and that way . . . and this way. . . . No one else need agree with me, but this is what I feel.” - As we lose our vagueness about our self, our values, our life situation, we become available to the moment. - We must learn to cope with the Test moments"

I was excited about it, and thought it would give me a lot of insights for my creative writing process, but I got disappointed from the beginning. It focuses a lot on god, listening to god, etc. So, I think it is not the right material for me. It is targeted to a very specific audience. Even when Julia Cameron tries to clarify in the introduction that when she refers to god it doesn’t have to be necessarily interpreted as something religious, it does feel religious when she mentions god. Her clarification sounds more like a failed attempt to have a wider audience. Also, I think this book could be useful for someone who is just (re)discovering her/his artistic self, not for people who have experimented already for some time. I had that rediscovering phase with creative writing more than three years ago... so, it’s possible that if I had started reading the book at that time, I would have appreciated it a bit more. Now I am at another level with my writing. Maybe I got to know about the book too late. So, no, I won’t read ‘The artist’s way’. Not for me, not at this moment of my life."

When it came up as an option for my 2022 reading challenge I added it to the list. I did a quick listen of it and liked what she said so much, I bought the book and have invited others to do the 12 week course with me. I completely agree that we are creative beings, with desires for creation and light deep within us. We stifle this throughout our life. I've been feeling urges to make time for creative outlets again and so this book was relevant, actionable and inspiring. I've started to do the morning pages (where you just process whatever comes to mind over three, hand written pages) and it surprised me how helpful it was almost immediately. Clearing my mind of the noise allowed me to focus on important thing and made me happier. I'm going to keep trying to do the morning pages and the artist's date.

Personally I think it had a few interesting ideas, but mostly missed the mark. But I don't doubt that this book has a profound impact on people. The friend who recommended this was incredibly enthusiastic. ""Drop everything and read this"" were her exact words. What I found was a very woo-woo book about ""removing the blockages to your creative soul."" Maybe it's because I just came from reading a 1,000 page historical tome. But this book felt devoid of substance that might make you a better creative. Very self-indulgent. Like a grandparent saying ""you can do anything you put your mind to sweetie. Here, have a snack."" And I think that's probably the best analogy to this book. It's the grandma's cookies of creative self help. It doesn't do much about the problem but it will make you feel better about it.

The book is full of meaty quotes from other artists, but Cameron has a few quote-worthy statements herself. My favourite: ""The quality of life is in proportion, always, to the capacity for delight. The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention.”"

This is an intense look at how to get your mojo back, or how to access it if you haven't ever had it. I had no idea this would be so much work. I am doing the course (reading the book and discussing it, along with the exercises) with a group online. We are meeting for the last time on Sunday, and I finished reading everything last night. Every last word. I even read her recommended reading list, which is whoa, full of sound titles? Interesting. But back to this. I have heard of it forever, and just didn't think it applied to me. But hey. Lately my fingers have really been itching, and I really think that my artistic bent needs to be coddled and brought back out into the light. I always liked drawing, and pottery, and photography in school. But of course once you leave school, it's harder to do those things. I don't have a pottery wheel or a darkroom. And I was always into books more than those things. But who says you can't be more than one thing? That is just one of my takeaways from this. I did have some serious resistance at first, because there is a lot of God talk, and she delves deep into childhood in the first few chapters. Well, I am more pagan than anything these days, and while she says that's okay, she still has a lot of God language. But I got over it. And the childhood stuff always seemed to assume that someone actually *paid attention* to you, when in fact, hello, my dad had his hands full just working and he no more encouraged any artistic tendencies of mine than bought me a pony. It's about the same. Even when I won an art contest in fourth grade and got tickets to a haunted house up at the high school. His one effort was actually taking me to the haunted house. But I had no more art supplies than what was required on our school lists, and that didn't even include a sketch pad. I drew on random pieces of paper and didn't even have colored pencils. So this means my knowledge of how to actually use the tools of art is woefully inadequate. But I'm working on that. So while I didn't have anyone squash my art, I also didn't have anyone encourage it (beyond the paint by numbers set that we did at my grandparents house at Christmas time). I am not sure I want to paint, but it would be fun to try. The book includes two tenets of artistic life: you must do morning pages, which I have dutifully done, and you must take yourself on an artist date, which I have tried to do. Most of the time that just means going to the craft store, but I need to get more creative about that. I guess the idea is that you will unleash some inner artist by doing these. That all being said, my art has always been writing. And this all applies to writing as well. It's all the same, essentially. One of the last tasks listed (because every chapter includes tasks to do, and some of them are easy and some of them are HARD) is to reread the book. So I am going to do that. The second to last chapter says to reread your morning pages. So I am going to do that as well. I am behind on the tasks, but I have done my best to keep up. I would like to do this again, but not during the holiday season, and to have weekly meetings instead of talking about 4 chapters at once, because we are not sharing much, just quick observations. All in all, though, I am glad I did this. And I also would warn against people charging for teaching the course, because as Julia says, there are no certified instructors, it's meant to be free. I paid $10 a month (so $30) for our person to lead us, and she has had some great insights. But I have seen folks charging $200. I know that it does take some time to lead, but the leader is meant to do the exercises as well. So they are learning too. I don't know if I will take another course. But I will reread. My book is all tabbed and ready to roll for another look through. I might wait until after things settle down a bit here, though. Do they ever? i will continue with my morning pages, and my artist dates. And I will dig out my camera, and my craft supplies, and maybe I can start making books again. I think this was the perfect time for me to do this. I am getting back to myself, and maybe that doesn't mean how I was before I got sick, but maybe a better version of me."

I did this 12-week-course twice (and stopped twice around the middle lol). The journal prompts and other tasks helped me to find myself, to get to know my fears and goals, past and future, and both of the times I had a breakthrough while being on a creative block. I’ve taught myself the bass guitar and signed up for an acting school, I started painting again and had the BEST ideas for new writing projects. I felt so motivated again, it was truly magical. With all that being said, I wish I could give this book EVERYONE around me who has trouble finding themselves. But a part in me hesitates. Because I certainly don’t agree with many things Julia Cameron says. She talks a lot about God, which she „warns“ us about in the beginning. I thought it wouldn’t be such a bad thing, if I just look past it. But damn, this truly is some privileged white middle-upper class new age spiritualism. I felt sick while reading the „Money chapter“ for example, where she kind of talks about how it is everybody’s choice to be poor. If we just build a better mindset around money, it comes easily. Umm… what? Or when she says it is okay to leave your child and other responsibilities to do more art. DAMN! This book would have been perfect, if Julia Cameron just sees that there are way more realities of life in this capitalistic, racist, sexist etc. society and people actually don’t have the privilege to do art and live from it. I am still so thankful for „The Artists Way“ and how much it has helped me. I will have my first theatre performance in a few weeks, just because of this book. I will definitely save a lot of the Journal Prompts inside of it and will use it in the future. I‘ll maybe share them with the people around me, but definitely not this book itself."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Overall, a very insightful, and practical “handbook-style” book to help unblock creative flow for anyone engaging in the creative process. Some of it is stuff I already know, and have applied, but it’s always good to hear it again, in different ways. Morning notes and Artist Dates are practices I’ve started incorporating right away, and I think they’re pretty useful. At some point, perhaps I’ll do the whole 12-week program, but I think it’s also useful to pick the exercises that seem like they have the most direct application personally, and do those. Cameron is sometimes is a bit dogmatic about alone time and solitude. I think it’s important to have personal creative space, but I think it can, and perhaps should be, incorporated into everyday activities (washing the dishes, going for a walk) in addition to more formal times of solitude, when possible (again, hours and hours are not necessary). She touches on this in the last chapter when talking about meditative exercise, but sometimes she’s a bit dramatic about “killing” the child artist within you. I recommend Thich Nhat Hanh’s little book on Mindfulness, which goes into more depth on Mindfulness practices. That’s really the only reason I’m not giving it five stars. That said, lots of useful stuff, and definitely worth reading!"

I must one day write a longer review, but for now: Several writer friends had recommend this in the past. A wonderful mentor-friend sent me this late October, 2021 after my work exploded, when I was wildly burnt out and did not know what to do. I don't typically read books like this; I bristle at anything resembling self-help. But late last year I was desperate to find joy in work and the tumultuous journey of life again, so I wondered what might happen if I read this, worked through the exercises, suspended disbelief, and took it seriously despite myself. I began morning pages December 30th, 2021 and diligently did them every morning for a few months. Afterwards, I continued them more haphazardly. Two weeks into morning pages, I had started evangelizing this book to all my friends; I must have convinced at least 5 friends to buy it and begin morning pages themselves. I genuinely felt much more clarity, a lightness in my body, an astonishment at how a leap of faith into trusting yourself and the world more could be so valuable. This was a very big part of my year, and in part precipitated some fundamental changes in my relationship to the world, to myself, to work. Very thankful! More thoughts to come one day on emergence, leaps of faith, existentialism, attention, etc."

I’m a deeply cynical person yet very sensitive at heart - expressing myself through art is something I both yearn to do but critique very harshly - so this book struck some chords but also some nerves. And sanded some jaded edges :’) I have some pretty big issues with “law of attraction” type spirituality that ballooned in the 90s, so some parts of this book felt a bit out of touch. There are very real structural issues that prevent access to art, time, materials, space etc and discrimination that is often glazed over in this type of thinking/spiritual bypassing. However! Many of the lessons and techniques (I love artists dates and morning pages!) we’re very valuable for reflection and intentionally carving time for subconscious creative space and play. Some of the tools and activities in this book really resonated with me and for those alone I recommend the book (just read it with a big grain of salt and supplement with good doses of structural race class gender theory ;))"

Much of the advice is very good and helpful, and even some of the spiritual mumbo jumbo stuff isn't totally off base if you look at it from a Christian perspective. However, there is a LOT of spiritual mumbo jumbo, and some of the worse advice boils down to ""be selfish, jealously guard your time even from your loved ones, and put your art first before EVERYTHING."" A lot of her ""self care"" talking points sound like they're straight off a ""wellness"" Instagram page; I actually wouldn't be surprised if this book is where a lot of the unhelpful modern conceptions of ""self care"" and ""self love"" originated. Again, not all of her advice is off base, and there are some genuinely helpful sections in here. I did write a lot of quotes in my commonplace book! But that good stuff is mired in a lot of new-age spirituality that can be difficult to wade through at times. Practice discernment with this one!"

I have picked it up and opened a random page to read on dozens of occasions. I reread the margin notes that I've written at various times. What I love about this book is that it uses art to talk about life. Specifically, it uses art and fear to talk about how our choice to have courage or not drives the degree of light you will manifest in your own life. The writers explore the human need for acceptance, fear of failure, communication sensibilities between your work and yourself versus your work and the outside world. In talking about other's ""magic"" in their work the authors write: ""Their magic is theirs. Your don't lack it. You don't need it. It has nothing to do with you. Period."" Stop coveting other peoples talent, skills, lessons. Find your own magic. Risk it. Earn it. Everything I read in this book could also apply to the art of relationship. The art of love. You could cross out the title word Art and write LOVE & Fear, and the same concepts apply. It's specific to art,yet universal. It's an easy read, barely over a hundred pages. Carry it in your backpack, put it in your purse, or on the back of your toilet. Read it. Return to it. Make your life your art. It's that simple and profound."

What separates artists from ex-artists is that those who challenge their fears, continue; those who don't, quit. Tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding. The risk is fearsome: in making your real work you hand the audience the power to deny the understanding you seek; you hand them the power to say, ""you're not like us; you're weird; you're crazy."" If is like a super deluxe 64 ounce mocha with flavored syrup, whipped cream, and a dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg on top, is like a shot of espresso. Both are like caffeine to energize your artistic career, and which you choose is really a matter of taste."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It starts out strong, very strong, and then falls apart in a semantic entanglement of mixed metaphors and pseudo philosophy that spends a lot of words saying very little. It's a bit frustrating to read, the section on art and science was a disaster, perhaps demonstrating the authors complete lack of understanding of science. The two authors refer to ""art"" in such a flimsy pretext that they not only fail to define it, they change the implied definition to suit whatever point is being made but then mix the definitions in chains of clumsy logic (sometimes to the fine art business, other times to any creative expression, other times to a limited set of work that is non-reproducible). They go further into neologic territory and leave the word ""art"" in an unusable state that lacks any coherent meaning. For an artist, the book is captivating in parts, especially in the beginning as it concerns execution and vision, and a discussion of common fears in the art making process -- excellent insights. But that's maybe a 1/5 of the book, the title is a bit misleading... By the end of the book, you'll likely be entirely confused and realize ""there's no definition of art"", and it's the artists (and art community's) own fault. Tirelessly extolling ""what is"" and ""what is not"" art seems to have ruined the word in our vocabulary... if it's going to become so subjective as to not have a communicable meaning, then... well it doesn't really mean anything. Anyway, it's a quick read and if you enjoy pseudo intellectual banter that lacks meaningful content then you might enjoy more of it than I"
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm an artist. This book is absolutely terrible. In the first chapter, the authors claim that that art came before consciousness and that prehistoric cave painters were not conscious beings. When they painted a bison on the wall, they had no idea what they were doing or why they were doing it. They didn't even know that they or the cave painting existed. So how the hell do you unconsciously paint a bison? If the prehistoric artists lacked conscious intent to create the picture, what exactly would prompt them to paint? Just automatic reflexes? Some sort of cave-decorating instinct that forced these unconscious humans to paint on auto-pilot? I don't think so. Obviously, the cave artists knew the bison existed and that it was possible to create a likeness of the animal using pigments. If they didn't, they wouldn't do it. The word ""creativity"" is not mentioned anywhere in the book, except in the tiny segment that points this out to the reader. ""Why should it?"" the authors ask smugly. ""Do only some people have ideas, confront problems, dream, live in the real world, and breathe air?"" Yeah, okay, everyone is creative - I get it. But not discussing creativity in a book about making art? What? That's like writing a recipe book and saying ""this book doesn't mention ingredients. Why should it? Do only some desserts have flour, sugar, eggs, butter?"" I have no clue why this book has such glowing reviews. The great majority of it is pretentious nonsense, obvious advice like ""don't worry about what other people think of your art!"", or just plain wrong information that the authors try to pass off as fact. I don't recommend it at all."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is about the challenges in making, or not making, art. Making art is difficult. Many times artists will stop making art and then feel guilty about not returning. Why? The is what the author says-- ""Lack of confidence and self doubt -- I'm not an artist-- I'm a phony; other people are better than I am; I've never had a real exhibit; I'm no good. Or maybe fear about what others say after looking at your work. Basically the only work really worth doing-- the only work you can do convincingly -- is the work that focuses on the things you care about. The individual recipe any artist finds for proceeding belongs to that artist alone-- it's non-transferable and no of little use to others. In the end it all comes down to this: you have a choice between giving your work your best shot and risking that it will not make you happy, or not giving it you best shot-- and thereby GUARANTEEING that it will not make you happy. It becomes a choice between certainty and uncertainty. And curiously, uncertainty is the comforting choice."""

The authors' basic premise is that you can and will only ever be you, and all the other people in the world will also only ever be themselves. It might seem obvious, but the logical corollary here is that it is a pity to not make art because you are the only person who could ever make the art that you make. A second corollary is that it is useless to compare your art to that of other artists. With that notion in mind, the authors explore different forms of fear that lead people to stop making art, and explain concisely why each one is silly, surmountable, and ultimately up to you to overcome. It's a beautiful piece of quasi-self-help that offers only blunt and useful considerations without any of the fluff and hand-holding with which self-help, as a genre, is infested. I loved this book. Its applications reach beyond the scope of art, and into any form of creative thought (whether in sciences, math, problem solving, etc), and should be read by absolutely everyone. I mean it.

Oftentimes, those who write, paint, sculpt or shoot fear discussing this topic with others, even other artists, at the risk of sounding pretentious or dull. To read this book, a slim, unassuming-looking little volume, is to feel freer in admitting: I am an artist, or writer. My work is important to me, even if it is unimportant to the rest of the world. It is important to my life and my peace of mind that I be productive. My work has a trajectory. Transcending this barrier often means the difference between shying away from the actual work and having the ability to sit down and, as one individual once eloquently put it, just do the fuckin thing. The book makes it clear that it is the product, and less the product, the artist's original conception of the product or the audience's review, which matters; hence, it is the process, sittin down and practicing, which matters most. As everyone who has ever written a paper realizes, the end result has most often made so many steps away from the original conception that it is more firmly rooted in the world for having been worked over and made real than in the writer's mind. The book also grants some wonderful advice for that difficult process of dragging your work out of your private cave, the most happy place where work is done in private, and into the world, where it has a better chance of survival. Look also for the guidelines approaching the best methods by which artists can work, and be inspired, by other artists (living and dead) in a way which is healthy and proactive as opposed to threatening. My copy is dog-eared and well underlined, and will sit on the shelf until I need another reminder as to why I'm broke and doing this with my life."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book was recommended to me and to all of my fellow art students by a professor, whose every word is normally golden. I must say this was the exception. When this small pamphlet of a book was published in the early nineties, perhaps it answered an urgent need of recent art school grads and artists struggling to stay productive when faced with the loneliness of the process. It's still true, outside of the nurturing environment of art academia, the level of disinterest in art, and the artist's particular work, is a sobering blow to the artist's sense of direction and self worth. All the tricks of convincing yourself to return to the studio and just churn out as much work as you can, inviting mistakes to happen - all that is still relevant. But its also advice easily gleaned from the art blogosphere, and reads as something akin to shallow pop psychology articles. It's not quite as redundant as the ubiquitous advice lists, but still it is a matter of getting someone else to tell you something you already know. I was expecting something revelatory for a book to be worth my time, but got a no-nonsense ""stop fretting about this and that and just do your work"" pat on the back. Which is fine. It is somewhat encouraging to have evidence that other artists have dealt with the very same setbacks, that the nature of the contemporary art world indeed cultivates unstable and broken-up sense of identity in most art-workers. But here are fears that are worth digging deeper. They merit a thorough treatise, not an advice column. Then again, I might just be the sort of person who enjoys 500-page books. To be fair though, I am already finding myself repeating to myself some of the key sentences from the book, that were particularly on point. For people who prefer laconic presentation of ideas, this might be perfect."

I find the very sight of its cover inspiring and must resist clutching it to my breast at all times like a talisman. The long review: The authors write that the book is the result of years of discussions about what artists -- regardless of the type of art -- have in common, and they come up with some very real, practical, and spiritual (in the best way) suggestions. The authors address the question of not ""why do we make art?"" but ""why do we stop making art, why do we quit, how do we keep going?"". They do it with such careful intelligence, compassion, and understanding that I am letting them get away with other things like capitalizing the words Art and Vision every once in a while. (If you're not Emily Dickinson, you don't get to do this, as far as I'm concerned.) I am also letting them get away with using the first-person plural (""we"") and referring to themselves as ""the authors"", because they also clearly have a wry sense of humor and genuine honesty that deflates gestures towards pretention. This book is basically about the craft of making art -- not the craft of writing a good sentence or painting a picture or dancing a pirouette -- the craft of becoming yourself, confronting yourself, mundanely holding yourself to the task at hand. It is genius, and I'm a little surprised it's not required reading in MFA programs. I certainly could have used its wisdom before now."

Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"First some words of introduction about why I read this book. Some people here on Goodreads know that I am using my retirement, which started several years earlier than is traditional, to concentrate on photography, a lifelong hobby that I have converted into a small business. And some of those some people know that, secretly, my passion is for abstract photography which I admire but struggle to create myself. Recently, however, I have signed up to a course. Well, it’s more like an on-line mentoring community led by my two favourite photographers, Valda Bailey and Doug Chinnery. Both of these two artists concentrate on Intentional Camera Movement and Multiple Exposures as a means of creating artistic and abstract images with a camera. This course comes in two parts. The first concentrates on technique and the second, more interesting to me, concentrates on helping people to find their “artistic voice”. As part of the community, there are a couple of “book clubs” running and this book is the first book we are discussing together. I have to admit to mixed feelings about Art & Fear. I liked that it was attempting to encourage people, me, to make art despite the uncertainty involved. It recognises that creating art is different to other “jobs” in that, if you do it properly, you put yourself on display at the same time as your work. All this is good to know, but is perhaps somewhat self-evident. But the book is annoyingly full of aphorisms and a lot of them are rather banal. Take “When you act out of fear, your fears come true” as an example. The book is supposed to be about what it means to make art in the real world. It explores how art gets made and what stops it being made. I am not an expert on art books, but from my own limited reading, I would say that if you want to read a book about making art in the real world, you should read by Sara Baume. I may come back and change my mind about this book after the discussion in my new “community”. Watch this space."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book was written by two working artists in 1993 to address the anxieties and concerns common to late 20th century makers of creative output such as visual art, literature, music, and performance. The authors cite that many artistic fears originate in places outside of their imaginations and supportive art-making environments. Prevalent social and marketplace attitudes about the value of art, who has a right to produce it and who will be recognized, praised and paid to do it are difficult for many artists to ignore and not internalize. Family, friends, laborers, and “professionals” all seem to agree that what artists do IS NOT WORK. Meanwhile, the artist hopes to make a living doing her own work but finds it at odds with what the marketplace demands, leaving her insecure about pursuing her intuitive art-making processes. Popular mythology casts artists as prolific geniuses made of eccentric tempers, emotional disorders, and more magical talent than everyone else. Such artists are often burdened with being expected to bear witness to all the world’s social ills, speak truth to power, and deliver soul-mending solutions to problems of every ilk. Inundated with such forces, some artists become paralyzed or find other reasons to abandon making their work. I recommend this book for artists who are feeling discouraged and wondering why they ever began their lines of artistic inquiry. These “observations” have such a definitive-sounding quality I nearly forgot my sense of humor but I don’t think that is a reflection on Bayles & Orland. It points to my own erroneous ideas that artists are supposed to be brooding, “deep,” profound, and only trifling with the most serious issues of the day. Looked at this way, there isn’t much about an artist’s life to be enjoyed; rather, it’s just a dilemma-filled endurance test! Hip-hop culture, “outsider” art, and “new media” forms are not examined by these authors, but I enjoyed this observation: For me the resonances and intimacy of the first half of the book were more engaging than the second part. I did a lot of underlining and bracketing and---oh look! a note to myself on one page reveals that I started reading this book back in 2008 but set it to the side for reasons unknown."

I'm a fairly successful and prolific playwright, but over the last year I have been struggling with severe writer's block. I've unable to even muster up the courage to look at a blank page or screen. The paralysis has affected my confidence and belief not only in my own abilities but also in the field I work in. What this book has shown me is that this lull is simply part of the process and I have to learn to interpret the fears I am dealing with in terms of my own growth as an artist and as a human being. There are many quotable pearls in this book, but without context, they seem rather obvious. The authors are really just trying to remind us of those things we already know, but have forgotten as we have matured in our art-making. The book's not for everybody. It's certainly not for the lay person who may want to pick up this book up in order to tap into their creativity. It won't make sense to them, and in fact, it may piss them off. The authors refuse to romanticize the artistic process and insist on making us confront some of the contemporary cultural and economic challenges that artists face today. No, ""Art and Fear"" is for the working artist (by which I mean, the painter, the writer, the director, the dancer, the composer, etc.) engaged in serious inquiry who has lost his/her way. It's for people like me who are blocked and/or questioning their pursuit in this enterprise called Art. It's not written by psychologists, so there are none of the familiar catch-words or prescriptive solutions for our malaise. It's penned by a pair of working artists who have also fallen into the same hole that we all end up in one time or another. In that sense, it's a survival manual, a kind of lifeline. But it's beautifully and elegantly written, too, condensing some of the hardest issues we deal with into real-world artists' questions. For that reason alone, it's a book I will keep on my shelf for as long as I write, because I know I'll come to this point again. As for this writer's block, I'm letting it have its way, for now.

Some of the concepts are useful, and there were some very good points made. However, it felt as if the authors were trying to stretch a five-page essay into a book; it was redundant and, after the first chapter, waffling. It also seemed as though the book was aimed specifically towards artists looking to showcase their pieces in galleries, which isn't necessarily a failing of the book so much as a narrow target demographic. On a more personal level, I was rather frustrated that only one female artist was mentioned amongst the some twenty or twenty-five artists referenced. When the authors mentioned Watson and Crick, he failed to mention Franklin, and while that would have been a forgivable omission in 1993, the copy I had was a 2010 edition, and that should have been rectified. It might be a minor nitpick, but it's an example of a pattern of exclusion. There really wasn't any excuse not to reference more women. There are so many wonderful, talented, brave artists out there who would have made for better material than ""a friend of the authors"". It seemed like the book was aimed at male artists looking to have galleries. It's not something I would recommend to female artists, and certainly not to artists pursuing other careers.

Part of the problem may have been the sheer volume of recommendations I got for this little guy and to live up to those expectations it would basically have to cure cancer, so take that for what it is. First of all, there were a couple of gold nuggets in the book. I rather liked the anecdote of an artist who took dancing for fun, excelled, then had to relearn how to dance for others when the chance arose for her to be part of a performance troop. It was just interesting that she had to relearn a skill she already had with a different motivation. Unfortunately, other parts were very trite at times and didn't make a lot of sense at others. I think someone else mentioned that when discussing cave paintings, the authors said something like the cavemen were not intelligent enough to be self-aware which struck me as blatantly false. As is common, it's loaded with adages about how art is made by people who make art, not people who stop and how hard work is hard to distinguish from talent, and that most artists feel like frauds, but none of that struck me as anything special. I've heard that many times before. Perhaps is it was new information in the early nineties, but now it's so readily available, it just seems like a giant yawn. Finally I was really put off by the author's text in boxes. Basically from time to time, they'd have a small aside to ""explain"" something, but it really seemed more like snarking than anything else. For example: Q: Aren't you ignoring the face that people differ radically in their abilities? A: No. Q: [...If each person made their best work, wouldn't] the more gifted make better work, and the less gifted, less? A: Yes. And wouldn't that be a nice planet to live on? That's not addressing the issue! I was also rather perturbed by the authors' description of entertainment as mass produced, clearly meant derisively. They barely reference commercial art and then rag on how there are very few paying opportunities for artists. It seems like they're missing something there. Finally I didn't like their section on schooling. There is a lot of merit to learning how to draw the figure if nothing else, but they never address that school might give you the tools to address technical matters. Again, this may have been relevant at the time of publishing, but I can tell you that there are schools that prepare you for commerical arts for sure. So basically, it had a few gold nuggets that got it a second star, but it really wasn't a great read. It had the virtue of at least being super short."

One of the basic and difficult lessons every artist must learn is that even the failed pieces are essential…The point is that you learn how to make your work by making your work, and a great many of the pieces you make along the way will never stand out as finished art.” “Fears about artmaking fall into two families: fears about yourself, and fears about your reception by others. In a general way, fears about yourself prevent you from doing your best work, while fears about your reception by others prevent you from doing your own work.” “Talent may get someone off the starting blocks faster, but without a sense of direction or a goal to strive for, it won’t count for much. The world is filled with people who were given great natural gifts, sometimes conspicuously flashy gifts, yet never produce anything. And when that happens, the world soon ceases to care whether they are talented.” “Even at best talent remains a constant, and those who rely upon that gift alone, without developing further, peak quickly and soon fade to obscurity. . . Artists get better by sharpening their skills or by acquiring new ones; they get better by learning to work, and by learning from their work.” “The important point here is not that you have – or don’t have – what other artists have, but rather that it doesn’t matter. Whatever they have is something needed to do their work – it wouldn’t help you in your work even if you had it. Their magic is theirs. You don’t lack it. You don’t need it. It has nothing to do with you.

I like the authors’ honest approach to the art life. A lot of what they write is lessons that I’ve learned over the years through experience and obsessive over-analysis; I think it would have been helpful to have read this much earlier in my life, though I don’t know if I would have believed all of it until experience had proved it correct. Aside from a few comments in chapters near the middle of the book (which are a little too “of the moment, ca. 1990s”), I found everything here to be completely relevant and on the mark."

It's a comforting, feel-good read, centered around the authors' own fears and expectations and experiences - as such, it's useful enough. I have a few nice quotes, both from the book's main text and from the quotes the authors collected. Some parts of the book, about uncertainty, or habits, are definitely more universal than others - there's a whole chapter dedicated to academia, and I found it uniquely boring. Maybe back in the day (1993 was almost 30 years ago, after all) it was all enlightening; now parts of it feel dated, especially with regards to self-expression and the division between art and craft. An okay read."

All levels of artists and creators can benefit from reading this book. There’s advice for the novice and the master, artists who’re about start on their chosen medium for the first time and those who have engaged in it for years. There’s advice for the working artist and those who haven’t yet entered the industry and those who have retired from it. There’s even advice for getting started and getting work done and how to keep motivated. It’s amazing how much Bayles and Orland have packed into this little book that amounts to just over 100 pages. As such, it could be a quick read, but I took a week (about 8 days) to get through it because I wanted to pay attention and adopt some of the advice Bayles and Orland shares. ★★★★★ A wonderful, encouraging read that all artists and creators should read no matter their skill level. • “Making art provides uncomfortably accurate feedback about the gap that inevitably exists between what you intended to do, and what you did. In fact, if artmaking did not tell you (the maker) so enormously much about yourself, then making art that matters to you would be impossible.” • “Making art is dangerous and revealing. Making art precipitates self-doubt, stirring deep waters that lay between what you know you should be, and what you fear you might be.”"

Bayles's and Orland's definition of an artist is a broad an empowering one, with an emphasis on the doing. The overall message of is an encouragement to quit, to make lots of art (even bad art), to refine as you go, to find your artistic process and voice. The goal, as they see it, is to find your work and keep doing it. is an insightful little book. It's from 1985, but it holds up well. It seems like it would be relevant for anyone from a performing artist, to a painter, to a writer. I think its emphasis on ongoing practice and refinement would strike a chord with athletes too.

Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I found an audio copy of this book at my library and started reading it when I saw it on a recommended list for writers recently. Oh my. Is it ever a fabulous book for writers?! I wrote down a lot of quotes from the book to save and read again: “This book is about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people - essentially (statistically speaking) there aren't any people like that. But while geniuses may get made once-a-century or so, good art gets made all the time. Making art is a common and intimately human activity, filled with all the perils (and rewards) that accompany any worthwhile effort. The difficulties artmakers face are not remote and heroic, but universal and familiar.” “Art is made by ordinary people. Creatures having only virtues can hardly be imagined making art. It's difficult to picture the Virgin Mary painting landscapes. Or Batman throwing pots. The flawless creature wouldn't need to make art.” “The only work really worth doing – the only work you can do convincingly – is the work that focuses on the things you care about.” “The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the ""quantity"" group: fifty pound of pots rated an ""A"", forty pounds a ""B"", and so on. Those being graded on ""quality"", however, needed to produce only one pot -albeit a perfect one - to get an ""A"". Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the ""quantity"" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the ""quality"" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.” “Those who would make art might begin by reflecting on the fate of those who preceded them: most who began, quit. To survive as an artist requires confronting these troubles. Basically, those who continue to make art are those who have learned how to continue - or more precisely, have learned how to not quit.” “The function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars. One of the basic and difficult lessons every artist must learn is that even the failed pieces are essential.” “The truth is that the piece of art which seems so profoundly right in its finished state may earlier have been only inches or seconds away from total collapse. Art is like beginning a sentence before you know its ending. The risks are obvious; you may never get to the end of the sentence at all - or having gotten there, you may not have said anything. This is probably not a good idea in public speaking, but it’s an excellent idea in making art.” “A brief digression in which the authors attempt to answer (or deflect) an objection: Q: Aren't you ignoring the fact that people differ radically in their abilities? A: No. Q: But if people differ, and each of them were to make their best work, would not the more gifted make better work, and the less gifted, less? A: Yes. And wouldn't that be a nice planet to live on?” There are many, many more quotable quotes. I think I'm going to listen to this again."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Feb 10th: I finished this a couple of days ago, having skipped through most of Part 2, which reads as though the authors dictated it while sipping long drinks and congratulating one another; it reads as though the publisher said, Come on, I can't publish something as slight as this [i.e. Part 1] Which is a pity, because Part 1, apart from some wordiness, is full of lovely observations about art-making (as ranted over below). Part 2 is long-winded and boring, and features more than one jokey little aside that isn't very funny. But Part 1 is true and useful. Feb 7th: I almost never write marginalia in books. Certainly not library books, and not even my own, because I know that I'll regret it: one day I'll look back at what I thought were my perceptive or enthusiastic comments and wince. Plus, it looks messy and the transient nature of my thoughts-as-reading-occurs is at odds with the (illusory) 'finished' state of the book's text. Having said that, as long as it's not inane I sometimes relish others' marginalia, like the involuntarily humorous comments of the anti-Catholic who has read & written in one of Wellington Central Library's Muriel Spark novels (it wasn't the bigotry that was funny, but the fact that this reader thought s/he was smarter than Spark), or the stern-browed exegesis of my great-grandfather in his enormous, leather-bound student Bible. Anyway, I'm unable to resist marking the margins of this book with wavery blue-biro lines. There are so many passages that are entirely true. It's about making art, and all the things that can stop us, and what helps. Here's one from the last chapter I read: The authors are photographers, I think, and they draw their examples from almost all the arts: photography, painting, sculpture, writing etc. It's striking that it doesn't really matter in what medium you work: the issues are the same. I bought this a few years ago and have sometimes dipped into it, but this time I'm starting at the beginning and will read all the way though."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"If you know me, you know I write songs, a lot. I've written about three albums of solo material and one black metal EP, not a bad output (I would think?) for someone who's been doing this rather steadily for only about 5 years (although I wrote perhaps 20 songs in high school, but never did much with them). Enjoying the smell of my own farts aside, I definitely come across a common problem when I'm writing (or rather, trying to write) songs. I often feel inhibited, have self-doubts, and worry about how other people will react to what I perform or record. Apparently I am not alone in this! The authors of Art & Fear have, without resorting to self-assuring new age crap, have made me feel a good bit better about the progress I've been making in my art-making, and have given me a set of tools to move beyond self-doubt and just, you know, _do the work_. I won't give away too many of the gems in this kind of self-help book for artists, but I will mention two points that really hit home with me that I've thought for years. 1) Once in a blue moon I write a song that somebody else really enjoys. That is totally worth it for me, even though I know maybe 5 people in the world will hear my music. In this rare scenario, I'm asked quite regularly ""how do you write such catchy songs?"" and I invariably reply ""I had to write a lot of shitty ones first, and I continue to write a lot of shitty songs."" This is confirmed in this book, quantity eventually yields quality. The example they give is great and I don't want to ruin it by spelling it out here. 2)You can learn a lot from your own work by going back and looking for patterns. This point really helped me out, because after I read this book, I immediately opened up my notebook and reflected about lyrical and structural themes within my songs. I identified five lyrical themes that recur over and over again, two or three broad musical/structural themes, and a few harmonic and melodic themes too. These patterns create boundaries which are kinds of points of resistance from which progress can be made by making small variations around the boundaries. A few years ago, I was chatting with a friend about how I wanted to make an album in a particular style of music, and I was asking him how he conceives of his albums. He said he just does what comes naturally, and this book kind of inadvertently emphasized that point. The inner editor provides a resistance that is ultimately blocking to creative 'flow', and taking home some of the messages in this book may help you to find the right strategies for blocking out the inner editor and just doing your work, because that is the most valuable part of what you do as an artist, or at least it should be, because that's what you likely spend the most time doing."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Good, comforting kernels of advice. I especially liked the emphasis on uncertainty, and how the ultimate key is to find nourishment within the work itself, as opposed to the finished product or its reception. I also really liked the chapter on art & academia, and the role of teaching and learning in terms of artmaking. Sentences I particularly liked: When you act out of fear, your fears come true. (23) Not many activities routinely call one’s basic self-worth into question. (65) Healthy artistic environments are about as common as unicorns. (71) Occasional competitive grousing is a healthy step removed from equating success with standing atop the bodies of your peers. (72) What we really gain from the artmaking of others is courage-by-association. Depth of contact grows as fears are shared—and thereby disarmed—and this comes from embracing art as process, and artists as kindred spirits. To the artist, art is a verb. (90) While good art carries a ring of truth to it—a sense that something permanently important about the world has been made clear—the act of giving form to that truth is arguably unique to one person, and one time… No one else will ever be in the position to write Hamlet. This is pretty good evidence that the meaning of the world is made, not found. (106) Artists come together, in the knowledge that when all is said and done, they will return to their studio and practice their art alone. Period. That simple truth may be the deepest bond we share… Only in those moments when we are truly working on our own work do we recover the fundamental connection we share with all makers of art. The rest may be necessary, but it’s not art. Your job is to draw a line from your life to your art that is straight and clear. (115) Art is hard because you have to keep after it so consistently. On so many different fronts. For so little external reward… In the end it all comes down to this: you have a choice between giving your work your best shot and risking that it will not make you happy, or not giving it your best shot and therby guaranteeing that it will not make you happy. It becomes a choice between certainty and uncertainty. And curiously, uncertainty is the comforting choice. (118)"

It feels as if the authors peered into my mind and took every fear and insecurity I have about making art on paper. I would read thirty pages, fall into a miniature crisis, then pick up the book again a month later to repeat the process. An excellent read I would recommend to anyone who makes art."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Art & Fear is unlike The War of Art or Steal Like an Artist. It isn't as short and full of aphorisms. Orland and Bayles start by defining the problem of fear and reluctance in art making. This book will demand your attention. You cannot dip into it whenever you want. Rather you need to concentrate and give it a close reading. The authors quote many artists and give their examples on various issues of making art. There is one anecdote that I loved and I have incorporated it in my writing if not in the drawing. The anecdote goes like this: An art teacher halves her class into two at the beginning of the term. Students in one group have to turn in only one sculpture and they would be graded on that at the end of the term. Whereas the students in the other half have to turn in as many pieces as they can and they will be graded on the total weight of their produced works. Surprisingly, at the end of the term, some of the best sculptures were made by the students in the volumetric half. They had practised so much in producing more and more sculptures that eventually they got better at it. The students in the first group learned a lot about art, aesthetics, and theory but while striving for perfection, they did not practice enough by making sculptures that they could get better on the back of that practice. This has led me to practice my art every day, no matter how little. The authors also warn of not adhering to superstitions the way Truman Capote did. He used to write 10 pages every day. If he finished his novel in three pages, he would write seven pages of a new novel. Orland and Bayles reject the idea of making art only when inspiration strikes. Here they agree with many other professional artists. W. Somerset Maugham had said that he only wrote when inspiration struck but inspiration struck him every morning at 9.

This book is mainly about the things artists struggle with, afraid to fail, afraid not to be noticed, afraid to get in a boring routine, no longer selling, heck even art school was discussed, which was for a lot of artists (me too) not a fun experience at all. I agreed with all the struggles really, that's why I read the book until the end. But besides the 'do it anyway' advice, the book didn't motivate me. To me it felt like listening to a long conversation in the pub, where everyone at the table agrees with the one talking... and everyone keeps nodding and nodding until they leave. But what comes after? When you get home, you still have the same challenges, the same issues, the same blocks...the only difference, you now know you are not alone in this. Good to know, sure. Useful, maybe. Will it make you paint more? Honestly, maybe the opposite because you are reminded of all the bagage you carry as an artist. But the title gives what it promises: Observations. Not advice, nothing motivational, just observations which sound true for most, of not all, artists out there."

It was developed over 10 years? It's a very thin pamphlet! It's one of those self-help (ish) books that's full of a lot of self-evident truths, with here and there an interesting application or thought. I believe it's aimed primarily at fine artists; if you're working just for your own satisfaction, or directly for a client, a lot of the obstacles described in the book aren't going to pertain to you. For instance. Unless you're putting together shows, you're not that worried about people ""getting"" you. If you're doing it for yourself, then no one else NEEDS to get it, and if you're working for a client, they'll tell you exactly what they want. And then change it 3 or 4 times, but that's beside the point. It was okay. There were a couple of points in it that I found of interest."

I've been studying Expressive Arts for years now and this is the first book that effectively addresses the daunting task of what those in EXA are asking participants to do. It is filled with wisdom, understanding, and acceptance of why many people claim they are not artists. Additionally, it's a quick read that goes down smoothy-free of pretentiousness and jargon.

One really helpful concept that will stick with me is that ""work is often terrible right up to the final revision"". Darkest before dawn. One can't expect an improvement after each edit like plodding up a mountain, it's just a change, and all the drafts might be awful until the final one, that makes it good.

I read it in 3 days. This for me is unusual, but it means, I like it. I absolutely give this the thumbs up. Observations on the Perils and rewards of Art-making The subtitle is exactly what you are going to get; a straight up honest account of the perils and rewards of being an artist. This is not only aimed at Artists in the painting sense, it often speaks of writers as artists, which is what appealed to me. I'm a bit of a writer with an artistic /musical streak. An artist can be described as anyone with a desire to , write, dance, paint sculpt, whatever. A desire to create. The authors explore the notion of what art is and why we bother. What do we expect/want from it. It explores fears about ourselves. The fear of not being good enough. Among other observations, the notion that a high tolerance for uncertainty is perhaps one of the roots of acceptance. To create is to error. you can start by asking questions and to quote Pablo Picasso ""Computers are useless all they can give you are answers"" It is about committing to making choices and finding your own work. In the end it all comes down to this. YOU have a choice, or more accurately a rolling tangle of choices. Between giving your work the best shot and risking that it will not make you happy or not giving it your best shot and thereby, GUARANTEEING that it will not make you happy. It becomes a choice between certainty and uncertainty and curiously uncertainty is the comforting choice for an artist. forever living between expression and doubt. This is an excellent read for anyone that doubts themselves as an artist of any kind. Anyone who yearns to do something creative but isn't sure if they are good enough, or have what it takes.

Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"For a book published in 1993, Art & Fear still has many relevant points for artists today. Outside of writing, I haven't read many books on art, so this falls more into what I'd consider the inspirational self-help than about the technicalities of the craft. That being said, it's applicable for any type of creative. Bayles and Orland begin with the central premise that they're addressing ""ordinary art"" which they define as ""art not made by Mozart,"" but by ordinary people. I suppose depending on the artistic circles you connect with, there are snobs who only consider ""real"" art from geniuses, but those folks aren't the intended audience for this book and you as the reader probably aren't either. It doesn't matter if you're making a living off your art or a hobbyist, the ideas in this book can help you in your process. For starters, art is difficult. The process inherently involves uncertainty which is part of why we doubt ourselves or even considering quitting. Bayles and Orland address this topic along with fears about self and others. I read the first half of this book pausing frequently to take notes. The second half deals more with the logistics and practical issues of being an artists such as how it looks in the educational system. While not as fruitful and a bit redundant, I thought the first half makes this fairly brief book suggested reading for artists looking for inspiration and encouragement."
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is a gem of a book. It was recommended to me by a very experienced painter. ""It has a horrible title,"" he said, ""It doesn't make you want to read it at all."" Very true. I ended up taking notes and rereading, and it is the type of book, where many times you think, ""ah ha, really, I had no idea."" Only 10% of art graduates continue to make art after graduation for instance. This is a foundation book for making art, and practicing, and getting better and having habits, and continuing on, no matter what. For instance, ""the seed for your next work lies embedded in the imperfections of your current work,"" or ""only the maker with time knows how important small conventions and rituals are in the practice of staying at work. The hardest part of artmaking is living your life in such a way that your work gets done, over and over and that means finding a host of practices that are just plain useful...A piece of art is the surface expression of a life lived within productive patterns."" Bayles and Orland published this in 1993. It hit me at the right time 25 years later. I'd recommend this slim, 120-page book to anyone who wonders how to make art or why people do it."

During my exploration for artistic resources, I came across this book. “Art&Fear” was a born from the questions, “do artists have anything in common with each other,” and more relevant to my relationship with art, “why do so many who start, quit?” After all I’ve started each year with a resolve to draw only to find myself quitting in a month. I realized my reasons for art, why I was drawing was not yet defined. And until I figure out WHY I’m doing this, I’ll always end up quitting. Art & Fear didn’t just provide lessons on my art. Art and fear provided lessons on my life. I recommend this book to one who is looking for motivation to work on their craft and is in a slump. After all, it motivated me to stick with art for the entire year. Here are some of my favorite quotes: “Artmaking involves a skill that can be learned” “Vision is always ahead of execution - and it should be” “To require perfection is to invite paralysis” “The lessons I’m meant to learn are in my work” “Tolerance for uncertainly is the prerequisite to succeeding in art” “The world is not yet done” Main takeaway,” only work really worth doing…is the work that focuses on things you care about”"

Interesting from the opening intro: ""This is a book about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art NOT made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people -- essentially (statistically speaking) there AREN'T any people like that. But while genuises may get made once-a-century or so, good art gets made all the time. Making art is a common and intimately human activity, filled with all the perils (and rewards) that accompany any worthwhile effort. The difficulties artmakers face are not remote and heroic, but universal and familiar."" to the concluding paragraph: ""In the end it all comes down to this: you have a choice (or more accurately a rolling tangle of choices) between giving your work your best shot and risking that it will not make you happy, or not giving it your best shot - and thereby guaranteeing that it will not make you happy.

As a pretty fearful person in life Ive ironically found art to be a freeing way to explore the unknown in a controlled way. I can understand why, if you do not struggle with anxiety, making art would be anxiety inducing rather than freeing. I think this book has thoughtful things to say regardless of where you fall in this and thoughtful things to say about a variety of related topics. I wish it would dive deeper in to certain ones as at times it feels a bit like a checklist of things but I think it serves its purpose. At the very least, maybe it will help artists who take themselves too seriously to chill, and artists who do not think through their art enough to ponder more. (Which is the more common situation I think) That, Or its just fun to talk about art forever and ever the end."

Am I getting easy or simply better at picking the right books? This one was outstanding because its observations applied beyond art making to life. And it achieved profundity at times. The sections on The Academic World and Science and Art are particularly compelling. The authors are photographers, but their discussion applied beyond the visual arts to writing, music, and performance. Their premise: art making involves skills that can be learned by ordinary people with lots of hard work and perseverance. Most people quit making art because they don't understand that viewers care about the product, but you (and only you) care about the process, and you must make lots and lots of art because ""the function of of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is to teach you how to make the small fraction . . . that soars."" ""There is no clearer waste of psychic energy than worrying about how much talent you have."" ""Vision is always ahead of execution,"" even if you're Michelangelo or Vladimir Horowitz. ""Tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding."" ""The only voice you need is the voice you already have."" There is lots of craft in art, and craft can be perfected, but art cannot. So if you feel your control of your materials is improving but you're still not making art, it doesn't matter because ""Art lies embedded in the conceptual leap between pieces, not in the pieces themselves."" ""The hardest part of art making is living your life in such a way that your work gets done."""
Art and Fear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187633.Art_and_Fear/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm surprised this book has an average rating lower than 4. I imagine perhaps most of the reviews come from non-working artists (Casual hobbyists? Non creators? People just reading the book because it's something to read?) or something. Not that there's anything wrong with that; I just personally found nearly everything in the book to be relevant to me as someone who gets paid to sit in a room by myself full-time to make art-like things, which subsequently leads to doubts and questions about my entire existence as both an artist and human being. After all, is what I'm doing REALLY art or is it craft? I've battled with the art vs craft question for many years, and Art & Fear restates what I already know: with craft, perfection is possible. Artists usually begin with art and move towards craft to perfect that art. Of course, it's probably not possible for artists to be conscious of that fact during the process of shifting. As soon as that thought becomes solidified, we try to get rid of it, like skimming the fat off stock left in the fridge overnight. Or I suppose the takeaway is that we should constantly be reboiling, taking the fat and intermingling it with the rest of who we are. This book is for all artists who need a reminder that art comes from within our brains and habits and personal abilities to tell our own stories, not from both critically irrelevant external and internal criticisms. Imagination becomes execution becomes a finished product existing on a separate plane from the artist - the art is now a part of the world. I imagine I will be coming back to this one for reference in the coming years. I will have an open mind and take it as a review. There's some practical advice as well as some philosophical mumbo jumbo, and all of it is necessary and good to keep me in line with my life's work. We need to keep our passions alive amidst the feeling of inadequacy as we work and get paid to sell ourselves to survive. Who are we really, how does our work portray who we are, and how do we progress?"

Replace 'Art' with 'lab work' and every word will still ring true. I loved its emphasis on the normalcy of uncertainty, of failure and of fear in the field of art which can easily be transferred to scientific discovery. In the end, it's all about actually starting something, doing it all alone, failing at it and starting it over again. If you find yourself staring at a hard problem/ life choice/ career prospect- first, dive straight into actually working on it, and while you wade through those murky waters of uncertainty, pick up this book and give it a read."

The authors' emphasis: Yes, it IS hard for everyone, but the point is that you keep making it anyway. The only note I'd make about this book is that it could use an update--maybe a rewrite to spark it up a bit. It reads like it was written back before nonfiction and creative nonfiction fused (which it was), and hence is a little stiff. I think this book provides important enlightenment and encouragement to artists of any art discipline, but I think it would recapture a larger audience if its writing style were reinvigorated."

As someone who started doing art at the age of 30 and then stopped abruptly out of fear, I resonated with the book deeply. We'll see in a longer run if it helps me to come back to doing art (and for the moment I am hopeful). This book feels more like a collection of zen koans (like these paradoxes that make you think) rather than an actual manual or a framework. It worked for me, because I find art ineffable in its essence. So I needed a vocabulary and pointers rather than an actual map of the place. But this style could be discouraging for some. * In the end art lies on a crossroad of self-exploration (looking inside) and world-exploration (looking outside). W/o the first one you can't make smth meaningful for you and will be discouraged to work (but boy oh boy, it's scary to dig deep). W/o the other art loses its connection to the realness of life (and we'll all a product of the world around us to some extent). * Your reach as a viewer is always going to exceed your reach as a maker. * No one would care about most of your work anyway. It comes with a territory. * It's wise to give your work some time before showing it to someone. An insulating period of sorts to help you understand your work better. * 'Do more' is a better mantra for learning than 'do better'. * So cultivating small rituals that help you to do more work are important. * As you do more art, the knowledge of materials will grow. But it's a technical challenge in the end. So it's not the all there is to art."

He's one of the funniest artists around, and has taken graffiti to a completely new level. The paintings and installations just turn up, in the most unlikely places. Here's one of my favorites, which was discovered one morning on the wall of a family planning clinic in Bristol. (Note the thematically appropriate content). The local authorities were going to remove it, but the doctors asked if they were crazy. Erase an original Banksy? He's incredibly good at outwitting security. One of his greatest coups was the following exhibit, which turned up in the British Museum. They also decided to keep it! This book collects together most of his work, and is wonderfully amusing to leaf through. The thing I like most about him is his complete refusal to take himself seriously: what a contrast with Damien Hirst and the other pretentious idiots currently getting absurd sums for stuff that isn't any better than the pieces Banksy does for free. And although his main purpose is to entertain, he does have a serious side too. I'll give the last word to the man himself."

The identity of Banksy remains unknown, but his work is prolific. This title is the collected works of Britain's most wanted artist. His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls, and bridges throughout the world. Banksy displays his art on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and self-built physical prop pieces. Banksy no longer sells photographs or reproductions of his street graffiti, but his public ""installations"" are regularly resold, often even by removing the wall they were painted on. تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و سوم ماه اکتبر سال2010میلادی عنوان: بنکسی: دیوار و اثر هنری؛ مولف: بنکسی؛ مترجم و ویراستار ساناز فرازی؛ تهران کتاب آبان‫، سال1389؛ در240ص؛ مصور، رنگی، شابک9789648913767؛‬ عنوان روی جلد بنسکی؛ دیوار و گرافیتی؛ موضوع هنر خیابانی - دیوار نوشته‌ ها - از هنرمندان بریتانیا - سده20م کتاب، مشتمل بر ده‌ها نقاشی دیواری، و خیابانی، از هنرمندی «بریتانیایی» است، که به بخش‌های: «میمون‌ها»، «پلیس‌ها»، «موش‌ها»، «گاو‌ها‌»، «هنر»، و «مبلمان خیابانی» تقسیم شده است؛ در کنار هر تصویر، چند جمله ی کوتاه از نقاش، در ارتباط با موضوع تابلو، به چاپ رسیده است؛ «بنکسی» که فرزند یک تکنیسین دستگاه فتوکپی است، مدتی شاگرد قصابی بوده، اما سرانجام طی دوران «شکوفایی اسپری»، در سالهای پایانی دهه هشتاد سده ی بیستم میلادی، در «بریستول»، با گرافیتی آشنا شدند؛ او مردی ظاهرا سی و شش ساله‌، با نام مستعار، هنرمند فعال گرافیتی و منتقد سیاسی، کارگردان، و نقاش «انگلستانی» ‌است، که سال‌ها فعالیت پنهانی داشته‌ است؛ با وجود این‌که دیوارنگاری در «انگلستان»، به‌ دلیل آسیب‌رسانی به اموال عمومی، جرم به شمار می‌آید، او از سال1992میلادی، دیوارنگاری را، به صورت پنهانی آغاز کرد؛ هنر خیابانی ایشان طعنه آمیز، و هجویه‌ هایش جسورانه، و خرابکارانه‌ است، از این‌روست که مشهورترین هنرمند خیابانی به شمار می‌آیند، و امروزه، بسیاری از جداره‌ های شهری، در سرتاسر دنیا، اثر دست‌هایش را، بر خود دارند؛ «بنکسی» که دیوارنگاری را، از محله های محروم شهر زادگاهش «بریستول»، آغاز کرد، در عرض کمتر از ده سال، به شهرتی جهانی رسید؛ شهرتی که هر چه بیشتر می‌شد، ارزش آثارش را بالا‌تر می‌برد، و به گسترش ابعاد شایعات، و داستان پردازی‌ها، پیرامون ایشان دامن می‌زد شماری از آثار ایشان، بین پانصد هزار، تا یک و نیم میلیون دلار، در حراجی ها فروخته شده‌ اند؛ با اینکه بیش از ده سال، از فعالیت «بنکسی» می‌گذرد، تنها در سه چهار سال اخیر، نامش به رسانه‌ ها کشیده شده، و می‌توان ایشان را، محبوب‌ترین هنرمند نا‌شناس جهان معاصر دانست، که به خلق اثر در تونل مخروبه ای در «لندن»، «دیوار حایل بین فلسطین و اسرائیل»، تا «دیزنی لند»، پرداخته است؛ وی دستمایه‌ ی طراحی‌های خود را «پلیس‌ها»، «سرباز‌ها»، «موش‌ها»، «میمون‌ها» و «بچه‌ ها»، قرار داده است؛ او در این شکل هنری، انتقادی‌هایی روشنگرانه و جدی را، در قالبی عموما طنز آمیز، به دستگاه‌های امنیتی، و نظم نمادین مستقر در جوامع سرمایه داری، وارد می‌کند؛ «بنکسی» در آثارش، با ارجاعات مکرر، به کنترل‌های دائمی مردمان در شهر، که به‌ وسیله‌ ی دوربین‌های مداربسته، اعمال می‌شود، خود را به‌ شکلی «پارادوکسیکال (ناسازورانه)»، به‌ عنوان شورشی، معرفی می‌نماید، که علیرغم اشکال گوناگون چنین کنترل‌هایی، همچنان نا‌شناس، به فعالیت‌های غیرقانونی‌ خویش، ادامه می‌دهند؛ این هنرمند معترض، تاکنون در برابر دوربین‌های عکاسی، و تلویزیونی، ظاهر نشده، و کسی چهره ی ایشان را ندیده‌ است به‌ دلیل قدغن بودن دیوارنگاری در «انگلستان»، در نخستین روزهای کار، بسیاری از نقاشی‌هایش، چند روزی بیشتر، روی دیوار دوام نمی‌آوردند، و پاک می‌شدند، ولی در حال حاضر، با وجود منع قانونی کشیدن گرافیتی روی دیوار، رئیس شورای شهر «بریستول»، دستور داده، که نقاشی‌های «بنکسی»، به عنوان فرزند پرافتخار این شهر، باید روی دیوارها نگهداری شوند!

Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Disclaimer: Haters are not cool. I'm not 'hating' Banksy because it's the hipster thing to do (go grab an art school undergrad, you'll see what I mean). One problem with reviewing solo-artist art book is that you can't avoid talking about the actual artist, so here it is. I can't even be bothered to write about graphics. I mean, surely you're only considering buying this book because of the guy not the pretty layout right? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Why do people like Banksy? It seems like people either hate him or love him, and not the traditional oh-he's-so-controversial-edgy-can't-possibly-be-in-between kind. 'Serious' practicing artists loathe this guy because 1) he's an auction babe and 2) non-'serious' artists love him. His fellow graffiti artists have similarly divided opinion about him, ranging from the Robbo Vs. Banksy hatred to admiring him as the God of stencil art. A couple years ago when he first started doing those gallery stunts where he sneaked his own work in major museums (Brooklyn, MoMA etc) in that masked Sherlock Holmes outfit, I thought 'why, this guy is not a popular artist, what he's doing is clearly conceptual and bravo to someone who is expanding the boundary of performance art!'. Over the years as he got more public attention, Banksy became more reserved and civilised in the media. There is a trend in the rising street artists where the stereotypical persona of the rough, I'm-from-the-hood attitude is discarded for a safe, white bourgeoisie irony of look-I'm-fiddling-with-something-cool-and-dangerous-but-remember-drugs-and-alcohol-are-bad-for-you-kids! Remember ? Remember how bad-ass things were actually bad-ass, but now the symbol of rebellious angsty anti-authority icons are either Gossip Girls or Jersey Shore? (excluding ironic Che references) What Banksy does is arguably beneficial to the art community, in a way that he exposes the traditional obscure and anonymous operation of street artists to a wider audience. But he IS Edgy, Dangerous and c00l, you might say, look at what he did in Palenstine! Paris Hilton CDs! See, Banksy works best with a contextual focus rather than technical originality. In terms of fame and money, yes he makes a lot of those but he is by no means the first one (haters, please remember Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons are still out there). Andre, Basquiat and a bunch of other artists have benefited from the popularity of street art by boxing it into Sotheby's home. If you want to be more extreme, you can even argue Banksy isn't an artist at all. What he does is make statements and provoke his audience through civic sentiments. He is not consciously creating art. Even traditional graffiti tags have a narcissistic quality that is unique to art. Similar to , Banksy is another subject I avoid talking about. Yes, he's a serious artist and interesting phenomenon but many of his fans are obnoxious in labeling him as an academic artists because of this political nature and somewhat 'unconventional' genre. Banksy never publicly denounced other 'sell out' street or shock artists and I respect his unpretentiousness. Of course, people say 'well, I don't care if you're only into those 'serious' minimalists, abstract-nobody-except-your-art-professor-understands or installation art, Banksy is too cool for ""definition""'. However, you can't discuss the artistic merit of Banksy without including him in the circle, an exact contradiction to his principle. Well, now that he's widely accepted in the art crowd (I'm sure he doesn't have a problem with it, considering his generous rise in pay check) only complicates the matter. Is he still a serious 'street' artist? Sure he works with the same medium and similar themes, but his works are getting safer and more political for politic's sake. It is a shame considering the artistic merit of his works (although that is also debatable, some graffiti artists consider stencil art contrived. Personally I believe efficiency is important due to street art's, well, illicit nature of production) It is perhaps unfair to hate on Banksy for all the above reasons. After all, can you name one popular artist who hasn't been called a phony in recent years? The point I'm trying to make is that if you're serious about art, or street art for that matter, Banksy is merely credible and nothing unusual beyond that. Banksy is not 1) breaking new grounds, or rather, not that 'new' in the course of art history 2) technically/structurally innovative 3) authentic just because he works on the street and break laws and shit. I'm not saying he's not a good artist (if such thing exists), but I'm just going to avoid the next person that calls him the greatest 'artist' in the century, not that Banksy himself, I imagine, would care about this anyway, so why should you?"

As a graffiti artist and activist, he has a wicked sense of humor and lively imagination. Nothing appears beyond his satirical attention from Queen Elizabeth, the Metropolitan police, Disney, McDonald's, corporate brands and logos, historic monuments, livestock, and the Palestinian Wall. Smiley faced riot garbed police, rats in backpacks breaking into a safe, cavemen erecting street cameras, the grim reaper, painted cows, Mona Lisa shouldering a missile, Princess Diana 10 pound notes, and monkeys are just a few of his repertoire of images showcased in this book. He has left his political and social stenciled and sprayed commentary on sidewalks, buildings, and walls throughout the world. Whether you consider him an artist or a vandal, his body of work is impressive. He had the audacity to hang his own works in the Tate Gallery, the Louvre, the New York Metropolitan Museum, the New York’s Museum of Modern Art, and the British Museum with some lasting hours, days, or longer before discovery. His identity is unconfirmed but his street art criticizing war, establishment, and consumerism began in Bristol in the 1990s before moving to London in the 2000s. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the unauthorized The Art of Banksy exhibit that I saw in February 2019. The Coronavirus has not stopped him as indicated his latest work (in his home) as featured on Instagram. I tried to insert the image, but I don't know how to do it. The publisher included a note, “This book contains the creative/artistic element of graffiti art and is not meant to encourage or induce graffiti where it is illegal or inappropriate.” On the same page was a trademark announcing “Copyright is for losers.”"

The thing is, the Tate Gallery hadn't actually asked for anything of his. He just walked in (or had a friend walk in, or had a member of the collective walk in--Banksy's true identity is uncertain) and stuck it to the wall. This is just the kind of appalling disrespect that I think the world needs more of. Over the next couple of years, he made similar donations to the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Brooklyn Museum, MoMA, the Natural History Museum in New York and the one in London, and the British Museum. At least two of the museums have added these donations to their permanent collections. It takes a special kind of mind to tag Trafalgar Square with an enormous sign reading DESIGNATED RIOT AREA. Also to sneak into the penguin enclosure at a zoo and leave the message ""We're bored of fish."" And the Lady Di ten-pound ""Banksy of England"" notes are incredible . . . too bad he would face 12 years in prison if he actually distributed them. It's a shame that Batman and Wonder Woman aren't real, but at least we have Banksy."

In my head this most elusive of graffiti artists looks like Sean Bean and drives a Lotus Elan or something like that. This book spares the words and lavishes the photographs, letting Banksy's political statements, hastily and secretly sprayed onto walls, speak for themselves. If Banksy was just an anarchist, rustling with discontent, this book, and his art, would be unimpressive. But Banksy's art speaks with an edgy, wry, stylish accent. His spray-painted creations are no defacement. Instead, they're the graphic, unheard voices of those shouting ""something is wrong here!"""

Fallen angels, Cancelled Dreams, monkeys with signs reading “One Day I’ll Be in Charge”, SWAT Team policemen with smiley faces canvased on their heads, and much more. Banksy I think is a true rebel that expresses himself in art and stylistic graffiti that has messages of anti-authority, independent thinking, and even some self-criticism. What I like most about Banksy is that he doesn’t let it go to his head. Get this book for some awesome graffiti coming from the heart. “A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.” -Banksy"

Often the photographs have information with it: time, place, how long did it take to do it, how long it lasted - at least once in the last one the art was saved into a collection! Surfaces: walls, animals, on grass and beach sand, vehicles of road and water, street itself, some zoos. Themes: war, consumerism, thinking outside the rules, freedom, criticizing narrowness of 'what is art' definiton etc. Types: policemen/Buckingham palace guards, certain animals (monkeys, rats, cows, birds etc.), war machines, famous people, children, ""designated _ area"", and so on. As I've said, it's not always art: sometimes it's fake museum pieces, or sneaking art pieces (traffic cone art, decorating cameras with stuffed animals, putting 'shark fins' in park lakes, stickers etc.). I do have to admit that I don't like him spraying live animals, but him sneaking into zoos was amusing. He does most of his work in southern England, but has also done it in US and Israel, and it non-UK cities like Vienna, Berlin, and Paris. This is a good view into his art, thought-provoking and often amusing. As many are no doubt now gone, this is a good way of seeing them now. """""
Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Added later: I found it quite moving, his description of being drawn to graffiti the outside of the walls imprisoning the Palestinians and being told off in no uncertain terms by the inhabitants. To beautify the walls is to insult them. Of course. Obvious when you think of it. ---------------------------------------- I'm loving this, of course. And it's not that I disagree, exactly, with his messages, but a dominant one is this idea that Well, okay, but. There is lots of really clever, funny, aesthetically pleasing advertising out there and lots of crap graffiti. I like the following pictures, taken recently near where I live. I don't find the advertising displeasing juxtaposed with the graffiti. In fact, I don't understand why I'm supposed to find the graffiti pleasing either absolutely or relatively. Banksy's stuff is pictures which either contain words or read like words. I don't see why it is comparable to the first three of these pictures and nor do I see why these three are supposed to represent something more acceptable than the last. I think blank space is as important as silence. I don't understand why we have a desperate need to fill them up. Later: and I'm not very happy about this either: Sorry, Banksy, but this is bull. There is a literary canon. There is a notion of 'classical music', both of which are exclusive in exactly the same way you complain about Art. Just as there is popular music and popular writing, both looked down upon by their respective canons, so too in Art. There is a vast amount of popular art, including graffiti, including cartoons, including street art. People do that, they buy pictures being sold on the side of the road and they love them. They think they have purchased art. The mere fact that the governors of the Tate do not think so is neither here nor there."

Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Earlier this week Banksy's Devolved Parliament was sold for £9.9M. I am sure Banksy's haters wouldn't be too happy about it (ask their partners what they did that night :P) and Banksy would be having a hell of a laughter over this. My friend, a fellow Banksy lover, commented ""If you show people some (exquisite) meaning in what you do, they'll resort immediately to revaluing the entire thing in terms of money"" But of course this time he was talking about the strip club they went to, in the summer. That's the thing: if you did good, good enough, isn't everything art anyways?! But..but..but, Banksy doesn't get any of the money so you can take a breather. The title was first published separately as three different books. And it consists some of Banksy's works and words. It is great, you gotta give it a shot. This guy is an artist, we have established that, but he is a genius. Sheer fucking genius. And he's still alive. So let's not forget that we are known to only mourn a good artist after reading his/her obit. This time, we learn, I say. That is it about the book. What still fascinated me while reading this book was the auction. (My mind is a crazy place to live at) He has clearly mocked the government and I really have no clue how the art market works but it has gone on public record with the sale. Where I come from, this is friggin impossible. I cannot afford to speak against the government -- for the fear that tomorrow my family can go 'missing' -- let alone paint. Or sell for that matter. So if you're not a fan of Banksy and frustrated about this sale, and most importantly a citizen of Britain, US, Australia ('developed' countries) you have to understand that there is a freedom, the one you have, the one I can only dream of from here, you have taken that freedom for granted. True liberty lies in trivial things like commenting, discussing, protesting even. So my love for Banksy is not entirely about the aesthetics, it is about the politics and perceptions he holds of the society and what he stands for. Banksy to me is a conversation starter. ""Oh did you know about the wall in Palestine?"" (True story: I did not. Our media is garbage) and all wall artists represent a revolution: silent, not-so-silent yet constantly uprooting. Banksy sure got the deserved fame. If you need a glimpse into some of these, read the book. I am biased this way but it is okay. I am going to sober up in a while and delete all this to end up with ""good book. recommended by me. i don't know about you."" Wait for it. PS: I don't know why I bothered writing this review?!"

Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Provocative and clever, but I would argue ultimately vapid. Something like an underground cultural icon for urban youth today. I only see three basic techniques or themes in his methods: Irony. Soldiers painting peace signs, zoo monkeys holding homeless signs, traffic signs warning of more (or less) serious things. They're all clever enough, but ultimately just artifacts of a stagnant, consumerist generation that's well aware of its stagnation and consumerism. Like television commercials that poke fun at the fact that they're a commercial: it's witty and self-protective. This either leads to people hating the content and calling it a bastardization of art, or people loving it because they're in on the joke and they ""get it."" There's basically no message except, ""What's the message?"" Commentary on political decadence. Valid enough. But again there's no solution, no grappling with the actual complexity of issues. Just toting anarchy, non-hypocrisy, peace exclusively in terms of non-violence. His anonymity is fortunate because if Banksy were a real figurehead there might be some small shudders of revolution leading toward nothing real. Pranks/daredevilism. Gets him more laughs than respect, I'd say, except among disenchanted youth. There's a lot of ego involved despite his claims to anonymity and unpaid, unpretentious art. Why spray your tag across the world in challenging places if you're really being anonymous? He's an important figure for urban history, but he's not a hero and he's not a role model. He's full of talent (he wouldn't get this much attention if his art and stencils were ugly and untrained) and potential but ultimately has nothing to say and no real method of causing significant change. He's on a soapbox. On the other hand, though, because of the way he's popularizing the art, he's also an example of empowerment for the voiceless. But I would also suspect that his example has led to just as much useless or vapid graffiti as it has intelligent graffiti."

That was the epic moment when I got acquainted with his works. Banksy's works are thought-provoking. It's creativity and urban art at its best. He's not only a mere street artist but also an epic troll with a refined sense of humour. ""Wall and Piece"" highlights Banksy's works around the world. In a photography album look-a-like, he presents some of his street paintings in collage format, quick political thoughts/quotes, and stimulating stories about activism. Whether he uses stencil pencils to paint rats as an analogy for humanity or anthropomorphic pop-culture elements, all these works manage to convey a fresh message on social and political subjects. The ingenious stunt of exhibiting his paintings in the world most famous museums was a witty prank. A simple image, at the right time, is enough to grab anyone's attention and shock the viewer. Street art can convey strong and stimulating messages in an urban environment. We live so passively our daily lives that we forget about the reality outside our inner world. Art, in general, has the power to create an emotional impact on ourselves, especially in controversial topics. Some call him thick-witted and vandal. However, if he managed to grab your attention and convey his message, it already means something."

He's a brilliant man with a paint can, and a clever writer as well. I would recommend this book to anyone not familiar with his work. A few quotes of his I enjoyed were: Some people represent authority without ever possessing any of their own. The greatest crimes in the world are not committed by people breaking the rules but by people following the rules--it's people who follow orders that drop bombs and massacre villages. A recent survey of North American males found 42% were overweight, 34% were critically obese, and 8% ate the survey. We can't do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles. In the meantime we should all go shopping to console ourselves. We don't need anymore heroes, we just need someone to take out the recycling."

To me, the essence of Banksy's art incarnates this quote for it is humanistic and internationalist. Banksy is an English artist from Bristol and that’s all we know. He remains anonymous and is still hiding his real identity, like the awesome guys from the . He is internationally praised for having revolutionized the graffiti art, like the DP has did too with the Electronic Dance music genre in the mid-90s. However, the two french djs used to mix at parties with uncovered faces, whereas Banksy has never painted or appeared in public. Well, anonymous unless the recent surprising revelation by an investigative journalist turns out to be true. Craig Williams has published in the Daily Mail an article with a surprising revelation that is based on a long investigation. Williams claims that , member of the famous band , is the guerrilla graffiti star because art keeps appearing near their gigs in different countries. If this revelation turns out to be true, than I'll add it to the many other reasons behind my love and admiration for this band: - Their avant-garde Electro music - the remarkable and amazing appearances of immensely beautiful and talented actresses/models in the creative music videos of their latest album : ~ ( ~ ( ) who btw also happens to be painted by Banksy in a Warholish artwork () ... hmm could it be just another coincidence? ~ And the divine () More recently, a new article by The Independent seems to approve this hypothesis. It's all in the headline: [] However, Goldie could also be referring to , which was the claim of a «scientific» study conducted by academics at the Queen Mary University of London in 2016. This study relies on “Geographic profiling” (Geotagging), a technique used to catch serial criminals: ~ ~ Gunningham was first pinned by the Mail on Sunday as the elusive artist back in 2008. Most journalists are inclined to believe that Robin Gunningham is really the mysterious ‘graffiti bomber’, moreover since it is believed that he was caught on camera a few months ago The attempts to unmask his identity are numerous but none of the claims is confirmed and the saga of Banksy’s mysterious identity still goes on.. What i find irritating is how the artist's nickname, Banksy, has become a generic term, overused as a label and as an attribute. It is tossed off by most journalists every time the subject is related to the graffiti art. It is like making an analogy between my 3 years old niece's paintings with Picasso's cubism every time she draws straight lines. Very often, you will read articles about the Banksy-likes: + There are the 'Young Banksys', such as the 10 years old Solveig + The 'Rightwing Banksy', like 'Sabo', an American Republican Street artist based in LA + There are the 'female Banksys': -A graffiti artist called Aiku + And of course Bambi, the most famous one: On the other hand, Banksy has inspired many female artists to get involved in this form of art: Of course, in our capitalist mass-consumerist society, everything ends up being commercialized and measured by its money value. Art is no exception, as its creation for autotelic reasons by the artist seems to be an ongoing myth. Of course, I don't mean that an artist must work for free like those who consider that Art is a disinterested activity. I meant to point out the catastrophic monopoly exercised today by the art galleries in the nauseating market of Arts, pricing the artists' artworks (the one million dollars question: what are the criterias?) and appointed as the high authority who decides for the public what is good art and what is not (Exhibit A: that pseudo-artist by the name of Jeff Koons).. Most often, It's some clueless tasteless snobs who buy and sell these paintings as safe long-term financial investments (In the past century, the aristocrats used to finance the greatest artists (like the impressionists), but that's a long story), instead of having them displayed for the public in the more and more financially powerless museums. Anyway, that is another long debate.. The auctions at the prestigious Galleries that are featuring Banksy's artworks has no doubt tainted his reputation as a guerrilla-artist. Btw, The book description on GR has to be updated, the prices of his artworks exceeds 45k by far, this one was sold for the modest amount of one million and a half dollars. Banksy is a street artist. Basically, street art is defined as a - [Wikipedia] In 2015 Banksy has created a huge dystopian park called Dismaland (obviously lampooning Disneyland) in which he has installed huge creepy artworks . Banksy's art takes always the form of urban activism. He proved it again recently in 2017 with his new project, the Walled Off Hotel in Betlehem. It's an hotel packed with his artworks and with a horrible view on the concrete slabs of the separation wall * * Banksy's creations and epigrams are purposed, transgressive, provocative and subversive. The political messages and symbols that his drawings and murals deliver are powerful, particularly those on the Palestinian side. He has even sneaked undercover in 2015 to the war-torn Gaza and painted a series on the rubbles and ruins of the demolished buildings in the devastated areas. ~ Some of his works in Gaza during the Israeli strikes in 2008.. Unfortunately, they are still relevant today: Again, what does paint? - [The Guardian] This says it all, she is a prominent artist worthy of Banksy's legacy because thinks so. Or is it the other way around, he bought her 'amazing' works because an Art gallery has said they are? Anyway, I'm not interested in the evaluation of her artworks, my point is to show how much ridiculous I find this analogy is."

Some people enjoy hating on him because he makes loads of money out of stencilling these days and his messages are sometimes vaguely anti-establishment. I remember Charlie Brooker once dedicating a whole article to how much he thinks Banksy blows nuts and it's the only time I've found myself disagreeing with my personal Jesus. This is because if we focus on the artistry rather than the personality, then the sheer scale of his work and just how public it has been over the years is phenomenal. Anyone who has made a stencil bigger than A4 or has tried putting up graffiti in public places will tell you that the technical aspects of what he does are jaw dropping. Even if he gets planning permission (which I'm pretty sure he doesn't given the content of what he's put up), the scale alone is incredible. And call me a moron, but I actually appreciate the images. He has kept with the historical spirit of political stencilling as a form of protest. Contrary to what Wikipedia tells us, political stencilling was around during WWII - often employed by fascists and the resistance movements to spread propaganda messages. From what I've read and seen over the years political stencils have always been vague because they're supposed to be provocative; they're not supposed to be academic essays with footnotes and bibliographies. So, yeah, I like this guy. There are better books on graffiti and stencilling out there, but this is a worthy read if you appreciate what this fella does - either technically or through his vague anti-establishment messages."

He's against the global soulless corporate machine, but his art is by nature a quick hit, the artistic equivalent of a Big Mac. It's incredibly refreshing and accessible and it's art that actually means something. In a wander through a museum like the MoMA or the Tate Modern, you see some interesting designs, the occasional piece that's quite clever in concept or execution and a lot of pretentious crap. Banksy as an artist is a reaction to the high brow direction of art over the last hundred years - he makes art that's relevant to, accessable to, and understandable by the average person. Also, his work is damn entertaining, usually showing a great cheeky sense of humor. This book is, if nothing else, a great introduction to the man and his work. I highly recommend it, especially to those that really like art, and those that really dislike art."

Banksy was in town, and in true clandestine fashion, the location of his show was a secret until just hours before it opened. I was impressed. I had never heard of Banksy, but his highly successful, clandestine, guerilla marketing intrigued me. I did a Google search on him and was even more impressed with the images of his work. He was a famous graffitti artist from Britain, but the work I found also included beautifully altered oil paintings from the previous century -- work that conveyed intelligence, humor, and political intent. Who was this guy? The LA show was dominated by an elephant in a room. A live elephant, elaborately painted in pink, in a staged living room. Brilliant! I loved every page of Wall and Piece. Banksy’s work encompasses different styles and techniques, but all capture the mind of an engaged and passionate artist. Every image evokes a reaction from me.

I gathered from the summary and people's reviews that, more or less, HE was worth the read, if not the book itself. I love art, it's my vessel to any interpretation I choose to have, and if you truly love art, there are no lines that a person can't cross. There are no lines that an artist can't draw, no limits. I firmly believe artists also think differently than normal people. More often, it is the artist who is the introvert or extreme extrovert, the mysterious, the most imaginative, the more thoughtful and always the most perceptive. So really, this book makes me think that he is a scatterbrained person, as most artists are, who do not work well with organization but rather impulse, which I happen to like...it's easier but at the same time quite difficult. The compilation of this book was amusing and pretty rebellious; I just got this feeling that it wasn't voyeuristic in any way. And I wasn't inspired because it had ideas of ""revolution"" or ""F*** pigs"" and a singular, slightly irrelevant (in the way that only artists can get away with) reference to the Nazi camp and how through a lipstick tube, individuality sprouted. The issue I had with the book was how the ideas were inputted in a quote or two and expressed in pictures, but the pictures following were all the same (rat, rat, rat with gas mask. policeman, policeman, policeman urinating on the wall) so I couldn't develop my initial interpretation. His art is wonderful to see, he is truly an artistic soul. He is witty and thinks outside the box, then cuts the box up with daggers. (referenced) It was interesting and recommendable. My friend told me this changed the way he viewed art, but I would've thought that the concept of art displayed anywhere, art that is different and rebellious against authority, art in a different medium, is not foreign and not necessarily unique. He graffitis in the security of knowing it is true art, and it is risky because of the places he chooses for display. I thought the ""f*** pigs"" on the pig was predictable, the security cameras in the woods relatively blah, tagging cows, the defacing of other people's art pretty lame. I don't know for sure if he cares to have respect for graffiti art, but if he does, he's going from the angle that other art disrespects his art, instead of their artists, in this book. I read/interpreted it, carefully and with perspective. Again, cool cool art. But in the end, it just didn't read me. But I liked it! Don't take any of these reviews to heart. Art is art. Art is like people. Interpret away. That's why I'm focusing more on the book as a whole, not just his art. That's why it's a book review. Now I'm off to check out Banksy reviews!"

It's great fun for anyone with a bit of an anarchist bent to their personality. Even if, for some reason, you strongly disapprove of graffiti, you gotta admit Banksy's stuff is pretty cool (I think you do anyway, but who am I to tell you what to think). He may be too well known and hip for his political message to be heard now, unfortunately... I'm not sure, but it's my sense that to a lot of folks once it's 'cool' you can like it without paying attention to what's being said, like Rage Against the Machine... do you really think that whole heaving crowd of baseball cap wearing humanity in audience at Lollapalooza is cognizant of the plight of indiginous people in Mexico?

I cannot say I am a fan of graffiti, but this title looked interesting. Who knew? I was facinated by the photos of this artist and author's work. So unique and enigmatic. So unexpected! The book was divided into themed sections and there were a few pages of text that told his story, briefly. He seems to have been all over the world and tagged his name everywhere. Banksy uses stencils to do his unique work. He said he developed this after he realized that it took him too long to do his pictures and he was getting caught too often. What he does is not just common graffiti one normally sees scrawled on fences and walls. It is not gang art. He has a purpose and theme in mind for his work. His stencils must take hours to come up with and cut out, to enable him to create work that can take as little as 18 seconds to spray on a wall. He makes signs. He pokes jibes at police and museum art. He pokes fun at people. He paints pictures in places right under the noses of police cameras and manages to paint scenes on walls like the wall in Palistine. He paints on live animals, right under the noses of gun toting farmers. This IS art and I am glad I got to see it."

Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I held off on this book until I had gotten at least halfway through Will Ellsworth-Jones' unauthorized biography of the street artist/cultural phenomenon, Banksy, because I wanted to soak in some of the biographical context and to imagine the pieces and the circumstances of their creation and, to some degree, build up a little suspense before visually confronting them. (Update: My review of the bio is complete; SEE ). This well-printed art/picture book with accompanying snippets of captioned humor, wisdom, and impertinence penned by the artist has sort of been the bible of Banksy fans for a decade. Anyone who is already in the choir will not need preaching about this book, or about Banksy, of course. My knowledge of him came late and in a roundabout way that I'd normally keep to myself, but here it is: One of his pieces was appraised on the TV show, . Yes, I used to watch it occasionally on visits with me Mum. The piece featured on the show was not very impressive, but it led me to read a little about him and thus lately I've been having a catch-up Banksy marathon, checking out two books and watching Banksy's Academy Award-nominated 2010 documentary, . I'm not completely sold on Banksy as a great artist, but there can be no doubt about his stature as a leading artist of his time, at least in terms of influence, and certainly as a provocateur. Banksy's , from his enforced anonymity, working methods, political agenda and contribution to the zeitgeist (including the conversation he has stoked about the role of art/commerce, what is authentic vs. what is a sellout, rebellion vs. conformity, as well as the possibility that all of these can co-exist uneasily and provocatively) all seem to swamp Banksy's actual art. What this book seems to prove is that Banksy is mainly a culture jammer, manipulating the system and laughing all the way to the bank. Getting in digs at the rich while taking their money. Many of his pieces are simply cleverly placed ironic bits of text or simple graphics (a gaping alligator painted on a no swimming sign, for instance). Both the internet and a book like this are a necessity for any street artist wanting to preserve the most fleeting of art forms, and Banksy, for all his pronounced nonchalance about the survival of his illegal outdoor art has spared no effort or expense to make sure his ephemeral works are immortalized after their supposed demise. Banksy is, after all, ironic, contradictory, arguably hypocritical, or simply playful in what he says and does and how he acts. Banksy plays the rebel but that does not mean he isn't one. The main thing that Banksy understands, in his art, in his life and in his actions, is that life is a game, that it's funny and that it can't be neatly labeled or put into a box. And that may be why his art bursts defiantly out of boxes, breaking a kind of fourth wall. If a street wall is a canvas, that does not mean the art has to only stay on the wall. Sometimes a piece can start on a wall, continue down a sidewalk, turn a corner and end blocks away in a fabulous punchline (see the work on page 32 of a policeman lighting a fuse with his cigar, for instance, and follow where the fuse leads). Banksy's art confronts life as if it is a joke, an absurd jest from the heavens, and his artistic japes at times seem feeble, almost resigned and helpless in the face of it all -- settling on tossed-off whimsical sighs at the world's injustices. When Banksy is overtly political, I do like what he has to say, and some of the writings in this book, though brief, are thoughtful and even moving. His political art, in my view, is uneven, though his heart is in the right place. His paintings on the Palestine wall in the occupied territories, for instance, want to make a statement about freedom and imprisonment, yet strike me to some degree as unintentionally mocking those imprisoned. A ladder painted to the top of the wall, or a beach scene bursting from it, may make a grand statement to the world and gained the artist a lot of press, but these efforts almost seemed to be painful, goading reminders to those local residents of an outside world they cannot access. To Banksy's credit, he quotes in the book a resident who basically affirms that. Banksy's hatred of camera surveillance (certainly something borne from years of eluding authorities while painting graffiti) results in some of his most striking and disturbing work. By placing surveillance cameras on altered duplicates of bucolic old pastoral scenes, for instance, he reminds us of what has been lost as well as what we might expect in the future. My favorite pieces in this book include a steampunk skindiver seeming to emerge from a public fountain holding a large drainage plug; two tuxedoed rats stenciled on a wall standing next to a rathole from which a painted red carpet extends over the curb and into the street; His Master's Voice dog aiming a bazooka at a Victrola; two cops painted on brick wall (one painting a large peace sign and the other guarding the scene with an automatic rifle). One sequence shows a blank wall where Banksy stenciled an official-looking government-styled ""designated graffiti area"" notice, followed by the results of street artists taking the notice at face value and filling the walls, and an email from one of the suckered street artists who was arrested falling for the joke. In one funny sequence resulting from Banksy's ""feuds"" with fellow street artists, we see a stencil of the hit men from menacingly holding bananas instead of guns. In the next photo we see it covered in regular graffiti by rival artists. In the photo after that we see the hit men restored, but this time wearing banana suits and holding guns. It's a wonderful way to turn a running gag on its head. Banksy's understanding of irony is often brilliant. On one page he quotes the infamous ""broken window theory"" forwarded by criminologists in the '80s that broken windows and graffiti can worsen neighborhoods and breed crime. Next to that, he prints an email forwarded by a frustrated local complaining that Banksy's graffiti has driven land values up, making his neighborhood less affordable to live in. This book is an art book but also a performance art book, and probably a bit of prank, and while it does give some insight into Banksy, it is not the end-all book to learn about him. The artist-author's lighthearted ironic captions won't satisfy anyone's ""curator-grade"" informational requirements. For what it is, I quite enjoyed the book, but recommend it as a supplement to other works, such as the biography aforementioned. (KevinR@Ky 2016)"

The copyright page of this book contains the label ""Copyright is for Losers"" along with the statement that ""against his better judgment Banksy has asserted his right... to be identified as the author of this work."" There is also a disclaimer from the publisher: """" The book itself is a collection of Banksy's amazing art work, both outdoor graffiti and installations as well as some of his drawings and altered oil paintings. Here and there you are also given brief glimpses into his thought process. For example: A few interesting facts (lifted from the wiki article): -Banksy came upon the idea for using stencils whilst hiding from the cops who interrupted an 'art making' session. He realized he could make his pieces in a much shorter amount of time with a stencil; less chance of being caught. -On 27 April 2007, a new record high for the sale of Banksy's work was set with the auction of the work 'Space Girl & Bird' fetching £288,000 (US$576,000), around 20 times the estimate at Bonhams of London. On 21 May 2007 Banksy gained the award for Art's Greatest living Briton. Banksy, as expected, did not turn up to collect his award, and continued with his notoriously anonymous status. -The owners of a house with a Banksy mural on the side in Bristol decided to sell the house through Red Propeller art gallery after offers fell through because the prospective buyers wanted to remove the mural. It is listed as a mural which comes with a house attached. -The Westminster City Council stated in October 2008 that the work ""One Nation Under CCTV"", painted in April 2008 will be painted over as it is graffiti. The council says it will remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that Banksy has no more right to paint graffiti than a child."

As Banksy himself states, you will love him, hate him or you won't really care. So, how you feel about this book will be very personal. Does it speak to you, or not? It did speak to me. I don't hold Banksy on a pedestal as some do, but I appreciate what he is creating. Art that challenges us. ""What we need in this race is a lot more streakers."" Or maybe just more provocative graffiti writers. Banksy is clever (probably too clever for his own good.) He is an artist in every sense of the word, creating pieces but also thinking and stretching boundaries. I particularly like that he doesn't take himself too seriously, readily admitting that the depth someone else saw in his work wasn't actually what he intended or that a group of ""revolutionaries"" robbing a cell phone store made his Che Guevara piece a little ironic . . . ""Why would someone paint pictures of a revolutionary when you can actually behave like one instead?"" I like that he admits that even the people he's writing for (specifically those behind the wall in Palestine) don't welcome his work. At the same time there still seems to be an arrogance in Banksy, his view of the world being above reproach. I may not agree with everything he preaches but I do like that he challenges everything we hold dear about society, because a complacent society is a dangerous place. His work can make you think and challenge your complacency, if you let it. He goes straight to the heart of our societal problems (money, war, obesity, consumerism & capitalism as the highest good, class inequity and the unequal distribution of food, water and wealth in the world) and makes these issues funny and frequently uncomfortable. He pushes art for the people pointing out something that I'd never really thought about before. ""We the people, affect the making and the quality of most of our culture, but not our art . . . The Art we look at is made by only a select few. A small group create, promote, purchase, exhibit, and decide the success of Art . . . When you go to an Art gallery you are simply a tourist looking at the trophy cabinet of a few millionaires."" It makes me wonder how Banksy feels about his fame, wealth and celebrity followers. I'd like to believe he simply doesn't care. The art makes me laugh and evokes strong emotional responses as I look at it. I wish I owned this book so I could look at it again and again. But, having said all of this, I still wouldn't want my son to grow up to be a graffiti writer. But, I don't want him to grow up to be an advertising executive either."

In the meantime we should all go shopping to console ourselves. ” I feel like Banksy has been an idol not only for street artists, but for most young people who wanted to change something when I was a teenager. Despite his constantly being chased by the Police, who labeled his art as vandalism, he constantly proves there is always an opportunity to create art, as long as you have something to say to the world. Anyway, the English- based artist actually has no need of presenting, so let me share my favorite works from Wall and Piece. The book is divided into six parts, including the famous Rats, Monkeys Cops / my favorite ones /, Cows , Art and the so- called Street Furniture. Some of the graffiti have lasted for a long time, others, like the installations in the Louvre in 2004 had unknown duration. Others have been removed in minutes. Who said authorities didn’t do their job? Banksy himself says “Your mind is working at its best when you’re being paranoid. You explore every avenue and possibility of your situation at high speed with total clarity.” Paranoid or not, Bansky is the symbol of a new era in modern art , yet again proving art unites people- even if it’s sometimes AGAINST something and serves a greater purpose than the early 19th century’s French “l’art pour l’art” / “art for art’s sake” ."

Art as in confrontational, public, political, and utter satire. He's a tagger/graffiti artist (supposedly anonymous) who bombs* London and the English countryside. *bombing is the sorta-militant, hip-hop term for ""defacing"" public areas with your statement in graffiti. For taggers - it's all about the 'get-up' - ie, how frequently you bomb- how daringly public it is (like on the wall of a London Police Station in the middle of the afternoon where millions will see it as opposed to a farmer's barn in the middle of the night when no one is around) and how difficult the task of tagging is- repelling off a bridge to tag some billboard over the freeway or in New York’s Metropolitan Museum or hell - on a live COW, rather than - wow, slapping a stencil on the sidewalk for 3 seconds and running away. Banksy takes public expression, freedom of expression, and urban blight to political extremes - and is very cheeky and witty about it. He speaks in the language of the street, and it's beautiful. It's very hard to encapsulate someone so controversial and brilliant, so just get the book. It's a coffee table size mix of both the art and his message - explanations written occasionally as to what he's trying to say, as well as how and when the pieces went up - and how long they lasted (because, in the eyes of the Public Works Department - and the Po-Po - he's a bloody vandal and should be jailed.) Check out his website, it's beautiful. Thankfully his work is captured for posterity in this book."

One of my favorite artistes...Yes, I mean to say that in French, because it sounds better. Anywho, Banksy, a classic Guerilla-Political-Mad-Skilled stencil artist-OK, so he's a graffitti artist. But in this book, you realize just from the photoes that he's a quick-witted guy, with a mysterious twang, which is really cool. His classic humor includes spraypainting on farm animals and a fetish for stencilling rats. My brother, a stencil artist who prefers painting his stencils onto classy tees, really looks up to Banksy. Imagine being so good at something illegal that sometimes workers with the law praise you for it. That's Banksy. He's so good at his job that he gets paid for it, has sponsors, and should he spraypaint near a neighborhood, the locals have an election to see whether or not Banksy's work should get destroyed or stay as an eternal mark of his art. I'm not sure he's ever lost! This book is very excellent, and it's quite the shame you can't see the back cover, but look for it! I purchased my brother this book for the hols and I must admit...I have swiped it and looked through it numerous times. I can't get enough of the one of Charles Manson as a hitchhiker with a sign stating, ""Anywhere"" craftily placed in his left hand. Pretty cool!"

There are examples of his work from the UK and beyond -- on the street, on walls, in zoos, and even in museums, where he cleverly poses his own work along side that of the masters or famous artifacts. For the most part, Banksy lets his images speak for themselves, although there is some writing here to explain his approach and views on the crass commercialism that blights our global landscapes. His imagery is what draws readers in, and I found it particularly interesting that he lists the times several of his images remained up. He also has an amazing ability to let some of his images blend seemlessly into their selected homes, as with the ""official announcements,"" so much so that they seem to belong. Only with a keen eye are some of these artworks apparent. The photographs, which often capture passersby's reactions, are works of art themselves. This is a book of joy and spirit, of clever repartee and statements about the state of the world.

Graffiti was a way for young youth to express themselves but it was just writing some made-up names on walls, or that was what I thought before seeing Banksy's works. The drawings and sculptures that Banksy made are really thought provoking with real heavy artistic values. They showed that art can be made in the street without the help of commercial art snob. I mostly enjoyed his work in Palestine. This book which is a little glimpse on what this amazing artist thinks and how he works was a magnificent work of poetry.

Ok, so my opinions about this book and Banksy in general are varied and complicated so bear with me. Before I'll devolve into a rant, I'll just say it's an interesting book that gets you to think. Give it a go. I'm a huge believer in graffiti, as in art that's placed around public places, not just random misspelled phrases. In fact, there's a part of me that believes that in an ideal world, there wouldn't be a need for museums because we could just cover all the wall of the world with art and people would be respectful enough not to destroy it. So I don't need convincing that graffiti is art. I guess my problem is what Banksy does. I mostly agree with him ideology wise but every time I see his work I want to scream at him ""OK YOU HATE CAPITALISM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO STOP IT?"". I want to ask him how he'd run the world differently. He's so incredibly critical and I can't help but wonder if those are his thoughts or if it's just a way to be edgy and gain a following. What does he propose? It's not enough to be critical. I also think it's strange how he kind of became everything he stood up against. Like Banksy is getting a following and slowly being perceived as a mainstream artist. It's what he stood up against and I wonder when and if they'll put his work in a museum, will he still be against it? I was also really annoyed by everything he did in Israel/Palestine. Why is he injecting himself into situations he clearly doesn't understand? It's not helpful to either side, it's just annoying. I feel like, as a person, I've grown tired of people who whine. And that's what I feel Banksy's work does. He's whining. Policemen are bad, capitalism is bad, modern society is bad, technology is bad, everything is bad. Okay, what's good? Or how can we make it better? I can't quite word everything that irritates me about his art but that's some of it. 1. Graffiti is cool. 2. If you place your paintings in museums, they will stay there for a surprisingly long time. 3. It is possible to make a career out of being cynical and critical."

Other than all that the concept of anonymity when it comes to art. Creating art for the sake of art, for a purpose, without showing of your brain and your name, I've been thinking about that for quite some time now. Banksy is a perfect sample to study.

Although I don't approve of vandalism generally, I can make an exception for someone who breaks into museums and installs his own paintings. This book collects snapshots of much of his best stencil/graffiti work (in London & around the world) as well as other pranks of varying nature. For example: -he breaks into the Barcelona zoo and gives the animals signs like ""HELP ME I'M A CELEBRITY"" -he posts fake but official looking ""Designated Graffiti Area"" signs all over the city -he goes to the West Bank and paints miscellaneous frescos on the Israel/Palestine ""security wall"" (and somehow avoids getting shot by snipers) Instead of pretentious long-winded essays by art scholars, the book has interesting and direct captions from Banksy himself. I enjoyed reading his explanations of and commentary on all the stuff that he's done. Some people say Banksy's too obvious, but those people are too obvious."

This is how I will connect the lesson to the umbrella concept of conflict as well. I will build on this enthusiasm by breaking students up into groups and having them discuss a choice of collaborative projects that they want to try from the online long distance collaborative teaching resource Epals. I will have the students select three projects that they would like to participate in and create one of Kelly Gallagher's comparison charts. Next, I will have the students research their choices in groups. Each group will be assigned a different project to research. They will share their findings and complete the chart. Finally, we will decide as a class which project is the best for our class."
Wall and Piece,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114683.Wall_and_Piece/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'll make this brief: Banksy has a message, and it is presented through his artwork. He is raw and honest, even admitting that someone read deeper into his meaning than he had thought it through himself; though he admits he went with it, he also presents the truth in this book. Many artists/writers are pretentious and won't stoop to just being a person who happens to have talent. Banksy seems real and seems to love art for art's sake. His paintings tell a story (see: Banksy painted on the wall at the Ramaliah checkpoint in 2005...his guide(s) weren't entirely forthright with him, p. 140) that is compelling and presents not only art, but an experience as well. Since some argue that art has become experience (Warhol; Duchamp; Salcedo; etc.), Banksy stands as a proponent of such a modern interpretation/presentation. Definitely worth the price/a look."

Still Brittain's most-wanted criminal graffiti artist, his work has gained him both international renown and notoriety, depending who you ask. The art in Banksy's work lies in how, regardless of who beholds it, every piece he creates elicits deeper thought than most 'classic' artists. His art is truly for the sake of art, not for money but rather for the masses, displayed anywhere from the crumbling walls of decrepit old buildings to the halls of The Louvre. (Although, in case of the latter as well as other such 'high brow' establishments, installed in secret without permission; such is his hallmark, so-called 'guerrilla' art. Long story short, if you only read one book on art your entire life, let it be 'Wall and Piece'."

A perfect example of this in the field of art is the anonymous street artist, Banksy. Banksy's true identity has been debated on for some time, and having students analyze his (or her!) street art without knowing who Banksy actually is would be a great lesson in how lack of identity also has an effect on one's work. I would have students pick one of Banksy's street art pieces and analyze the possible meanings of it. I would then ask students to reflect and write on how that particular piece of art could be interpreted differently if Banksy's identity were known (ie; if Banksy is a male, female, black, white, etc.)"

The polarization of opinions about his works are a testimate to how complelling and topical they really are. The last frontier of unadulterated expression left in the world is the kind that re-appropriates public spaces and speaks through universal images. P.S. Don't worry about the elephant.

If I was younger, I would have lived out life like this truly on the edge. He challenges all known concepts in the artworld, large corporations and politics at the same time and almost always with a humorous bent. The best part of Banksy is that he is the absolute master of humerous graffiti and art. You can never help but to laugh or smile at his work. His writing is quite good in this autobiography.

Banksy is famous for their guerrilla street art, and this book offers photos, short anecdotes and stories from several different countries. I think activism art is very important - Banksy advocates for peace, justice and freedom, and criticises capitalism, consumerism and the often elitist nature of the art world. My favourite pieces were the ones Banksy put up in art museums employing guerrilla tactics; it was interesting to see how long each piece lasted before someone realised it wasn't actually part of the collection. I also really enjoyed the vandalised oil paintings, I liked the mix of old and new."

He is a most prolific street/conceptual artist and although the book contains his works up until 2006, many of the art works are by now classic/timeless - and the book is definitely worth reading.

I love Banksy's art. This book, though, was disappointing. The argument that any public space is there to be painted is flawed. Not everyone has Banksy's skills. Sometimes a blank wall is better than one that has been defaced by artless tagging. The same argument could be used for silence. Should it be replaced by noise, however unpleasant? Advertisers pay money to people who own buildings in order to place their messages. It doesn't mean that their messages are artistic but at least they are regulated and removed if they are considered to be offensive. Banksy uses this book to spread his anti capitalist message, without giving an alternative. Anarchy may be his inspiration, but who would manufacture trainers and spray paint in an anarchic society? Or produce medicines? Or run supermarkets? We can't eat slogans. Unfortunately Banksy comes across as self righteous, desperate to appear hip (check the number of artworks in Hackney and Shoreditch) and delighting in his outlaw status - I appreciate the book is 10 years old but now Banksy would be allowed to paint freely while crowds applaud their house values go up by a zero. It's disappointing as I've always been a fan of Banksy's art, but in Wall and Peace, he just comes across as a bit annoying."

His work is usually more on the simple side, yet its message can be puzzling, complicated or sometimes just hard to accept despite the truth behind it. He is a modern day genius using a media not recognized or admired by all yet applicable to all at the same time. The thing I love about this book though, is not just that it showcases his work-but it shows where he got his inspiration from. Following the few most influential snippets of his life from being expelled at 9 to making his first piece in his late teens, it shows how he came to use the mediums he is so successful with today and also shows how he has thought of the ideas and concepts he has about society demonstrated in his work. Though it doesn't show much, the captions, the small pieces of text give all of us an insight into the mind of a genius-and that is what makes this book a five star book, not that it shows the genius through the work, but where that genius has come from."

The works are presented alphabetically by artist and each work is accompanied by explanatory information on it and its creator. is For those fans particularly taken by any given work of art who might like to find an opportunity to see it in the flesh, each work and, of course, each artist, is cross-referenced with an international directory of galleries and museums to visit. A sublime bit of toilet reading for me. At two or three paintings per trip to the washroom, the enjoyment will last for the better part of a year! How nifty is that? Paul Weiss"
The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Plain and simple: This was the book that made me fall in love with the visual arts. Almost every time I went to the library as a girl, I would borrow this book. I would sit and look at it for hours, never getting bored with it. I still haven't purchased this book for my collection, but I am planning on it soon!"
The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book sets out to present one work of art from 500 different artist. This sounds good in theory, but since all the artists and their one work of art are listed alphabetically, the end result is eclectic and chaotic. This would have been a much better book, had the same contents been arranged chronologically or at least thematically. As it stands though, the paintings (there are a few sculptures and installations here and there, but I will mostly refer to just paintings) jump all over the place in time and subject. It also seems unfair to have some amazing, iconic painters reduced to just one work of art, which is hardly representative of their overall contribution, whereas others (especially some of the more contemporary artists) could easily have been left out of the book altogether. The print quality might have been ok 20 years ago (my copy is the 1994 large format coffee table version, not the more recent 2005 pocket size edition), but is below average by today's standards. The resolution is acceptable, but the colours are quite dull. Also Many of the photos also display a strange yellow and orange colour cast, making the paintings look worse than they should. The captions provide adequate details both about the paintings and the artists. You will learn a detail or two about the paintings, the lives of the artists and even a few fun facts every now and then. It is somewhat sad though to read references to all sorts of other paintings done by the same artists. The format of the book dictates that we can only see one painting per artist and to see the rest, we would have to turn to other books or the internet. The selection of artists has a decidedly Western and Christian bias. There are a few Japanese and South-American artists here and there, but the overwhelming majority are from mainland Europe and English speaking countries. Also the depicted scenes (at least until the beginning of the 20th century) are from either Roman or Christian mythology or Western European aristocratic and everyday life. After a while, seeing the same scenes over and over again, even if depicted by different artists, becomes quite monotonous and boring. The book covers a vast range of genres. As a consequence, you may find your favourite genres either under-represented or too many examples from genres you don't care about. I found myself paying closer attention to the art from around the 16th until the middle of the 19th century, which I consider the golden age and pinnacle of painting. Art from before the 16th century is a bit too simplistic for my taste and with the rise of photography in the 19th century, painting seems to have lost focus and spiralled into an identity crisis, from which it has yet to recover. Impressionism was as an interesting experiment and the last of the tolerable departures from traditional painting, but everything after that - I just found myself turning the pages without even looking at the names of the authors of yet another solid cube, formless splatter or weird installation. It is a matter of taste of course, but I found too much art I didn't care for and thus will most likely not be keeping the book. There are also some fairly obvious errors in the book, where the captions talk about one painting, but the picture is of a completely different one altogether. One example is on page 98. The picture is of a beautiful landscape painting by the venerated landscape artist Frederic Church. However the captions talk about an active volcano Cotopaxi supposedly being in the painting, which actually is nowhere to be found. Only a Google image search turns out another equally impressive painting by the same artist, where a volcano named Cotopaxi can be clearly seen, but it is obviously a completely different painting from the one in the book. I caught the error purely by chance just by browsing around and I haven't read the captions of all the art pieces, so who knows, how many similar errors are in the book. In conclusion, with either a chronological or thematical arrangement, this would have made a passable art book. Unfortunately the paintings are arranged alphabetically by artists, which provides for a very chaotic reading experience. If you take it as a coffee book only to browse here and there, this book is ok, even if the quality of the repros is below average. If however you are interested in only certain time periods or art styles, you'd be better off purchasing a more focused book with better quality prints. If however you want to own just one book on art, I recommend the immeasurably better and magnificent ""Art"" by DK, which is my opinion is one the best books on art ever published."
The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was really an interesting concept. Hundreds of artists, drawn from many times, movements, places, one page spread per artist--one work, one short explanation, a little attempt to locate the artist in time and movement. I couldn't stay out of this at work--we kept going back, opening it up, arguing over whether the work chosen was the right one. That was a lot of fun. (Weeping Woman for Picasso???? Ceci n'est pas un pipe for Magritte? Really?) I must say, it did help that I was pretty familiar with most of the movements. It might have been tough to follow a narrative if I had had no idea about who was who. And one other caveat--this might not be a good choice for a conservative homeschool family. In addition to a large number of classical nudes, to which I have less objection, there are also quite a few more modern ones some of which I would not want my kids to see. But this was really, really fun and if you have a friend or two that knows a little bit about artists, you can have some really, really fun discussions/arguments/lively conversations about the artwork choices."
The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Small book but with quality, glossy pages. All the works are in color. What is interesting about this book (and by the way, I think there is a larger edition), is that, instead of listing artists and art chronologically, they are listed in Alphabetical order. Thus, a painting from the Renaissance is next to the work from a 20th century modern abstractionist. It makes for some interesting comparisons."

The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"So if you re-titled this, ""The (Almost Entirely Western) Painting and Sculpture (14th - 20th Century) Book, you'd know what you're in for - but it's not exactly pithy. Only the ""Painting and Sculpture"" part is openly acknowledged by the editors. The rest is deduced from what actually appears in the book, which is an alphabetically arranged list of 500 artists with one image each and a paragraph or two of annotation about the artist and the work displayed. There's also basic biographical details and information on the chosen image. As the editors note, the alphabetical arrangement leads to some startling contrasts since proximate works in the book can be separated by centuries and continents in terms of their actual production. This was actually quite fun, just look elsewhere for an education on how everything fits together conceptually, geographically and historically. 500 entries gives room for all the most famous artists (given the constraints of my alternative title) with plenty of space left over for people I had not heard of, some of whom piqued my interest. It was also pleasing to find women represented as far back as the 1600s, their work being of a quality matching that of the book generally. Great for flipping through - a perfect ""coffee table"" book."

So getting this book was a natural follow-up. It won Illustrated Book of the Year and is in the Top Five Popular Art Books on Goodreads. As stated in the introduction, this book is ""an A to Z guide to 500 great painters and sculptors from medieval to modern times."" It's that classic coffee table book--I even recently spotted it on a list for the best of the kind. I'm not the kind that collects those--in fact this is the only book of the kind I own. But if any such book should be part of every home, surely its an art book like this one, where the great Western artists and (alas only) one of their representative masterpieces is laid before you. This is also by far the heaviest book I own--you could do strength training with it--but it's worth its weight. A real keeper."

No, it's a picture book that gives almost twitter-like info on artists. Every artist included has one picture/one chance to make an impression on the public (art novices). The good things about it: the wealth of periods it hits on and the quality of the reproductions, to say nothing of its size (I have the pocket size version, in case there are others). I also enjoyed the little gimmick: listing artists in alphabetical order juxtaposes somebody like Lorenzo Lotto with Louis Morris. It reminds me of a similar encyclopedia of painting I used as a young teen. This might similarly spur young art lovers to explore further."

The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book made its first appearance in my life when I was about 9. Me and my mum went to a flee market where she bought it for me for some small amount of money, £2 maybe. I remember skimming through the pages looking at all the pictures and showing my parents my favorite paintings. It was my favorite book for maybe two weeks. I even carried it to school at some point in those two weeks. And then nothing. Eventually, it was just another book on the shelf at home for decoration. Fast forward almost 7 years, we've moved countries, I haven't got a single clue as to where my original copy is. However, I recently went to visit a family relative in Munich, who also happens to find interest in fine arts and such. So we walked around galleries, and I was hoping to find the book so I could finally get my hands on it again. But I didn't have any luck so we went back. She had a gift for me, she said she didn't want it anymore and that it would have better use for me. She handed me a german book and we looked through the book all evening trying to see if we could figure out the meaning behind paintings without reading the description. I really started to like the book, i studied it for days. I have only found out now that the book is the same book as the one I owned , just in a much bigger format and in another language. And I am BEYOND thrilled. Im only at the very start of my journey, so this book helps me tremendously to familiarize with all the basics like important artists, styles, historical periods and techniques. People much further down the line of the art world might criticize this book and say that it's useless, and badly written or whatever, but for me, this book is clearly written and extremely helpful, so i am forever grateful. I believe that even those who not take interest in arts should have a copy of this book, you don't even have to read it, you can just occasionally skim through it and you already feel so much more knowledgeable and inspired about the topic. It also might spark something in you, you never know. Maybe somewhere down the line i'll change my mind about this book, but for now my opinion still stands and it will always have a place in my heart. If you're thinking about getting or reading this book, do it!!!"

The Art Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I think this is perhaps the best format for art books introducing artists. A couple of lines about the artist, a couple of lines about the artwork, a couple of lines about the historical context, and that's it, the art can speak for itself after that. A small detail, I wish the artwork dates were moved from the bottom to the top (next to the artwork's title and artist's name), so one has seen all the info/context before checking out the art. Reading the book, it's difficult to ignore a theme which comes up repeatedly, so many artists seem to be even more manifesto loving, social driven creatures than some stereotypes suggest. So many times, the artist is described to follow philosophy/school A, then switches to philosophy/school B, or idolizes artist/mentor C, then switches to artist/mentor D, or creates a clique E, then switches to collective F, and so it goes. I don't think you get to see that so much in other art forms (for example, with writers or even musicians), where usually, the serious artists dislike (or at least claim to dislike) the notion of genres, tribes or ideology. Anyway, art is different, it requires technical skill (well, see subsequent paragraphs on that), and comes from a tradition of manual workmanship, perhaps it makes sense that when the apprenticeship system weakened amidst the social changes of the modern age, substitute forms would take its place. Another observation, from someone with a lack of knowledge in art, it's interesting how artists seem to fall either above or below a very narrow threshold. Above there are a relatively small number of very familiar names, classic and (semi) modern artists such as Botticelli, Chagall, Dali, Van Gogh, Hogarth, Klimt, Matisse, Miro, Munch, Picasso, Turner. And then there are so many names (in a book that's supposed to be a very basic introduction as well), which to this layman here at least meant almost nothing, usually not even a feeling of vague recognition of the name. It's for such an audience/reader that this book is great, to get acquainted (to pick a sample of names) to ""older"" (say, born before mid nineteenth century) artists like Hendrick Avercamp, Honore Daumier, Atkinson Grimshaw, John Martin, Jean Francois Millet, and also more modern ones (again, a biased sample of some I found extra memorable) like Max Beckmann, Victor Brauner, Edward Burra, Paul Delvaux, Otto Dix, Raoul Dufy, James Ensor, George Grosz, Gwen John, Wifredo Lam, Laurence Stephen Lowry, Roberto Matta, Paul Nash, Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, Alfred Wallis, Carel Weight. For one who knows most of these names, I doubt this book will be of value. What makes the book loose seriousness is the tendency of the editors to select laughable modern or conceptual art. I don't blame them, if the art world considers some artists as masters, then who am I to judge. OK, I judge. Especially since the rest of the review is more of a rant, for personal indulgence/reference, including funny/pretentious quotes from the book at the end. The inevitable juxtaposition of different eras/periods (since the entries are alphabetical), creates an unintentionally comical and sad effect. You get the high art of Caravaggio's ""doubting Thomas"" followed by Caro's ""rape of the sabines"" (or for a better title, ""a hoarder visits a scrapyard""). To quote an amusing and absurd part from the description, ""Caro didn't transform his materials into something else"". So what did he do? While reading this book, I couldn't help but drag the ""joke"" with more ""better title"" aphorisms, this got boring quickly but I write some here. Beuys, felt suit (I didn't feel anything, suit yourself). Buren, two levels (I sentence this column to ten years in prison, for contempt of the court of aesthetics and public opinion). Arp, leaves and navels, I (navel-gazing, I). Broodthaers, casserole and closed mussels (too much to handle, pun-ish me now). Burri, sacco (something fundamental is missing here and it's not Vanzetti). Albers, homage to the square (dommage, to despair). Andre, zinc magnesium plain (tile rust elaborate). Baumeister, mortaruru with red overhead (Willi by name, Baumeister by nature, or vice versa, just too easy, so no retitling. You'd think someone with such a fantastic three in one name would be extra self-conscious to do serious work). Boltanski, reserve of dead Swiss (your reservation has been cancelled. Is that even legal by the way, using photographs of dead people from local newspapers for the unauthorized purpose of an art installation? I'd normally laugh at the artwork's description but considering the topic, the blurb angered me instead ""in previous works, Boltanski had used photographs of Jewish children. Here, by using images of the Swiss, a race associated with neutrality rather than a specific and terrible fate, Boltanski lays greater emphasis on the universality of mortality""). Calder, lobster trap and fishtail (interesting to see the use of the word mobile in art in a pre cellphone era. ""Calder was the inventor of the mobile in 1932"". What is more of an abomination, comparing the older or recent creation, I can't decide). Another amusing/sad detail, you can tell from each entry's blurb how good/bad the art is going to be. If the blurb is actually describing the painting or has some psychological/social context, chances are something imaginative or skillful follows and that something is from the nineteenth century or earlier. If the blurb is talking about symbols, concepts, ideas and the philosophy of the artist, chances are something ridiculous follows and that something is from the twentieth century (with exceptions of course, the century has had its share of impressive artists). I guess I'm being narrow-minded at best or philistine at worse, anyway these are old criticisms that others have expressed better. I vaguely remember many eloquent, fun lines from Tom Wolfe's ""painted world"" on the topic. Although in the spirit of negativity in this review, I also remember extremely repetitious blah blah, and what should have been a brief, fun, ranty article, not a ""proper"" book. Yet, let's find something good to quote from it from Wikiquote (and as it turns out, even the quote on its own is repetitive). ""In the beginning we got rid of nineteenth century storybook realism. Then we got rid of representational objects. Then we got rid of the third dimension altogether and got really flat (abstract expressionism). Then we got rid of airiness, brushstrokes, most of the paint, and the last viruses of drawing and complicated designs"". ""There, at last, it was! No more realism, no more representation objects, no more lines, colours, forms, and contours, no more pigments, no more brushstrokes. Art made its final flight, climbed higher and higher in an ever decreasing tighter turning spiral until... It disappeared up its own fundamental aperture. And came out the other side as art theory! Art theory pure and simple, words on a page, literature undefiled by vision. Late twentieth century modern art was about to fulfil its destiny, which was to become nothing less than literature pure and simple"". But ironically, the editors and the artists themselves unashamedly express the same points in a language/philosophy that's more ridiculous than any writer's satire. I copy here some of the earnest fawning quotes/blurbs from the book. Excerpt. [The ""artwork"" is an arrangement of plain, identical boxes, attached to a wall like shelves]. This sculpture [...] demonstrates Judd's simplification of shape, volume, colour and surface, and reduces art to its basic essential, the cube. Minimalist in style, like all his other pieces, the work is deliberately intended not to represent, imitate or express anything. Nor is it composed in any traditional sense. To achieve minimal personal contact with his work, the metal or plexiglass boxes he used were put together in a factory, spray painted and placed in position by other people. All his pieces were called untitled and were as plain as possible because he believed that a work of art should be looked at as a whole. Malevich was the founder of suprematism, a system which strove to achieve absolute purity of form and colour. For him, this method constituted an expression of pure artistic feeling, or what he called non-objective sensation. In 1918, he took the development of non-objective art to its logical conclusion in a series of works entitled ""white on white"", consisting of a white square on a white background, the abstract to end all abstracts. Realizing at this point that he could take the concept no further, he reverted to figurative paintings. Merz was an exponent of ""arte povera"", a new form of conceptual art developed in Italy in the 1960s, which aimed at disassociating artistic creation from the notion of high culture. As the name suggests, the defining criteria for arte povera were poverty and lack of refinement, whether of means, materials or effect. Banality was raised to the level of art and commonplace objects were invested with metaphysical significance. Noland leaves a large area unpainted in order to achieve maximum visual intensity. He was one of the first artists to exploit the possibilities of bare canvas in this way. This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so. Robert Rauschenberg. [The telegram sent by the aforementioned artist when requested to paint a portrait, which since then is considered to be the ""painting""]. Also a theoretician and teacher, he was adamant that art should be completely separate from life, and life from art, saying ""art is art as art and everything else is everything else, art as art is nothing but art"". [On another blank canvas. The trick never gets old]. Fasteners form an integral part of the blank composition, which aims to rid the painting of any trace of painterly illusion. The work provides the spectator with an ecstatic tranquillity that's constant in its intensity. It also demonstrates the unique interaction between the flatness of the picture's surface and the wall plane behind. The work's connection with minimalism is demonstrated by the lack of emotion and illusionism in the painting's construction. Ryman's work concentrates on emphasizing the qualities of the materials used, both the paint itself and its support (canvas, plastic, aluminium and so on). From the mid 1960s, he's used exclusively white paint, so as not to distract attention from these concerns. He continues to experiment with a wide range of media and brushstrokes."

This book is an A-Z listing of some famous artists. Some you will most definitely have heard of, many you have not. The book has ALL types of artists...sculptors, performance artists, traditional paint. They are put back to back in this book, organized only by their last name, so you will see some interesting contrasts in their styles and presentation. Each entry has a brief text on the piece, some history on the artist, and the location of where the artist was born and where they passed if they are not alive, as well as where you can see this piece. This is a wonderful book for art fans, as well as those who are art curious. The price point is very affordable. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"

It presents 1 piece from each of 500 artists with a short paragraph about each. It's not particularly in depth or detailed but personally I find it a great starting point if I'm going to research a particular focus. It's easy to be able to flick through the pages and find artists who paint in similar styles or works about similar topics when trying to build a theme. Another great thing about this book is that for each artist it lists a couple of related artists that were either part of the same movement or painting at a similar time which is really great for being able to relate different pieces in context. I got my first edition of the art book when I was doing my art GCSE, but I still refer back to it today."

My education thus far dealt very minimally in art and art history. And I'm the worse for it. It's taken some maturity, international travel, and personal initiative to teach myself a little. That said, this book is a great book for beginners. I liked it because it allowed me the opportunity to see numerous schools, techniques, periods, artists in a way that was not overwhelming. Each piece is visually well-produced and contains a short description on the artist and the significance of the work. It also works well (at least my edition) as great coffee table piece to impress your cultured friends."

Some direction to other artist are given (in the same art movement, an influence (or who the artist influenced), or otherwise), and information about the piece (size, its making/material type, when made, where it is – sometimes in a private collection). At the end is a glossary of technical terms, and one on artistic movements (with artist examples), plus a directory of museums and galleries (address, phone, but no online sites) worldwide with some examples of art found in them. A good variety here, though its clearly centers on European/American artists. Some of course I have seen before (Mona Lisa, duh), but there were some surprises, including in what had been chosen for some artists as the art shown here. Sometimes I felt certain types of art were a little grouped in the pages, but that must’ve been just a coincidence due to names. A bit heavy to hold, but I read the book slowly and enjoyed it a lot. Well deserves to be paired with the Photo Book (which I also have read, and recommend."

With over 600 pages, the book features 500 of the most significant artists throughout history, providing a concise yet informative introduction to each artist's life and work.

I was 9 years old at that time I believe and I certainly wanted the book. I asked her but she refused. She was not reading it so that is why I asked her to give me the book for me to read but in the end, she refused. One day while she was content and peaceful, I asked again while in the class and she mumbled “Fine” and I immediately began reading and looking at the artworks inside. She was grumpy and furious all the time so finding her happy was a rare occasion indeed. The book was surely excellent. Would recommend but it is I believe rare to find these days.

That's the first problem, lack of representations. Phaidon Press should have also included selected works from ancient times, e.g- Roman and Egyptian arts. Apart from that, this book contains little to no work from Asia (3 Japanese and 1 Indian work), and none from Africa. And another huge problem is the arrangement of the artists in alphabetical order rather than categorizing them by different artistic movements.

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“I heard voices outside our front door - a woman's, bright as polished brass, and a man's, low and dark like the wood of the table I was working on. They were the kind of voices we heard rarely in our house. I could hear rich carpets in their voices, books and pearls and fur.” When the Vermeers came to visit Griet’s home she had no idea they were there for her. Her parents had decided, given their near destitution, to find Griet a position as a maid with a wealthy family. Her older brother had already been placed in a Delft tile factory. It was now her turn to earn the food that made it’s way into her belly. She was, after all, seventeen. Johannes Vermeer was a master painter, recognized even in his own time as one of the best, but he was a slow painter. He would only paint when he was inspired to paint. An empty purse or a rumbling stomach were never enough inspiration to make him paint faster. He averaged only two to three paintings a year. As someone who has always admired his paintings I do wish he had been more prolific with his brush, but the fact that there are so few paintings by Vermeer make them all the more precious. Griet is thrown into this chaotic household. The house is brimming with children, too many children even by the standards of the day. Catharina, Vermeer’s wife, liked being pregnant and though the added burden of a new mouth to feed each year places extra financial stress on her husband and her mother Maria Thins she is oblivious to the consequences. Their fortunes wane and fall based more on the property incomes of her mother than on the commissioned paintings of Vermeer. Each year the purse strings get pulled a bit tighter. There is one patron, a man who has bought several Vermeer paintings, who they all have to curry favor with...Van Ruijven. His wealth infuses him with an air of entitlement. He is used to getting what he wants and when he sees the wide eyed beauty who has just joined Vermeer’s household he decides he wants her. Vermeer has found from the very beginning that Griet is different. She sees the world as a painter sees the world. He finds reasons to have her help him by grinding paints and assisting with the objects that populate his paintings. It is only natural that a young girl would start to have feelings and dreams regarding a man such as Vermeer. He is not only talented, but he is also attractive with those gray eyes that see so much more than anyone else. She becomes very adept at lying so she can spend more time in the studio. Van Ruijven, like odious men always seem to be, is adept at finding young women alone. He is not wanting to gossip with her or exchange thoughts about the weather or to woo her or to cajole her into parting with her charms. His hands with fingers like hooks push against her clothes weighing the curve and shape of her. She has to fend him off without offending him. Griet has another man in her life, not one that she would choose, but one that is infatuated with her. Pieter, the butcher’s son, wants to make her his wife. Being the wife of a butcher is a dream for many women because she and her family will always be well fed. A butcher is miles away from dream landscape of being the wife of a master painter. Tracy Chevalier has deftly conceived the possibility of being a maid in the Vermeer household. With each new revelation the tensions between Griet and Catharina tighten like lute strings pressing into tender flesh. Maria Thins, a realist, runs interference between all parties as best she can, but Catharina beset by jealousy and churlishness has difficulty seeing the bigger picture. I’ve read where other reviewers were disappointed in this book. They felt that very little happened, but they must be the same people who think baseball is boring. I was on the edge of my seat while reading this book as if I were watching a ten pitch at bat in the bottom of the ninth with two outs. The deception of the pitcher trying to outmatch the quick hands of the batter. The shifting of the outfield depending on the ball the pitcher intends to throw next. The subtle communications between the catcher and the pitcher. Add a base runner at first and now the situation feels like Griet trying to maneuver her way through a world of lust, deviousness, and deceit. Does she run or does she wait for something to happen? There are lots of moments that need no dialogue as Griet experiences impossible longings… There are things we can’t say because they can not be unsaid. The painting that Vermeer paints of Griet is a compromise to Van Ruijven who wanted much, much more. With her direct gaze at her audience and the slight parting of her lips this is an acceptable form of pornography, slightly scandalous, fodder for gossips, but not anything that could bring unwanted attention from the authorities. It gives Griet a shiver to think of her captured innocence resting under the lecherous eyes of Van Ruijven, but better a painting than losing that which she wishes to give her future husband. I bought a canvas copy of The Girl With the Pearl Earring last year. The print is gallery wrapped which gives the painting animation as if it can jump away from the wall and walk into this life. She is hung over the staircase with enough light from the window over the door to show off the skill of Vermeer to illuminate. When people walk in the door they are struck as millions over centuries have been struck. People who don’t know a Vermeer from a Dali have to take a moment to access and appreciate her lustrous beauty. From where I sit to read I can see her and occasionally she catches my eye, a flirtation that makes me feel years younger.

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Another one of my wife's recommendations (I read a lot of books that way), I picked it up from the bookshelf the night we came back from seeing the film with Scarlett Johansonn and Colin Firth. I loved the movie--it was just so incredibly sumptuous--and was curious to know the story in the novel, which I knew from experience, and from my wife's continuous comments, would be different, more detailed. I was right. Chevalier has won a place in my heart and bookshelf. Her novels are well-crafted, simple to follow, and addictive; Girl was no exception. The story of the maid Griet in 1600's Delft, Holland, was amazing in its simple prose and endless emotion. Completely fictional (no one knows who exactly were the models for any of Vermeer's paintings), it nonetheless possesses a veracity that makes you believe Chevalier found the long-lost journal of this unknown woman and wrote her novel based on it. The details of seventeen century Holland are rich; you feel you are walking the canal-lined streets of Delft, smelling the pungent scents of the Meat Market, holding your breath as Vermeer paints next to you. Griet is a wonderful protagonist, taking you into her world, yet retaining a few secrets for herself, especially where Vermeer is concerned. Girl is one of those novels that truly invites you, and almost kidnaps you, to become part of the story, to walk next to the characters, to share in their lives, to feel as they feel. Watch the movie, by all means (the photography is absolutely incredible), but then read the novel and get the whole story. You will not be disappointed."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I know almost nothing about art, but even I can tell that Girl With a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer is a brilliant painting; 'captivating' is probably the best word to describe it. One presumes that Chevalier agrees with me, and this is what lead her to write a novel about the painting, its subject and its creator. So, is the novel as captivating as the piece that inspired it? The short answer would be 'no'. Now for the longer answer... Chevalier is probably one of the best-known historical novelists of the last ten years, with this book always in the foreground when she is discussed. As far as historical information goes, I think she does okay with it. I had a pretty clear picture of the Netherlands in the seventeenth century by the time I was done with the book (whether or not its accurate or not is another matter), but I felt at times that there wasn't that detail that critics proclaimed about on the cover. The characters, I feel, are never truly developed. Vermeer himself remains a mystery throughout, even to the protagonist and narrator, Griet, who appears to have some connection with him. Griet meanwhile, is what I would describe as a stock teenage girl character. She is similar to many characters I've read before, and yet she does not really advance on that. The narrative style is one that I would have adored at 14, but by now find to be pedestrian. This is first person narrative at its simplest (and blandest) and I don't feel that we gain anything from it - the novel may just as well have been in third person and would not have suffered for it. It may even have benefited from it. The structure is interesting. Split into parts that represent years, rather than having chapter breaks makes it difficult to find a stopping place at times, and it is this more than anything else that makes a page turner of the novel. Meanwhile, the entire thing seems to be building to the inevitable moment when Vermeer will paint Griet. The scenes are handled with less intensity than I had hoped for from the build up, and once the painting is finished, Chevalier seems to want nothing but for the novel to be over too, and closes it down rather too quickly. Perhaps the fact that little is known about Vermeer's life would imply that a fictional version of it would be easy to tell. Sadly, the gaps in knowledge seem to be too big to fill. At the end of the novel, I had discovered how this work came about, the girl staring out from it, but still had almost no real idea of the man behind it. It is, in my opinion, a failure in this respect. However, it is a good read if you're looking for something historical but not too heavy. Or if you like art there are some interesting discussions about colour in there. I can see why many people enjoy this novel, but I cannot fathom why some hold it in such high acclaim. I feel it will be some time before I read anything else by Tracy Chevalier."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Girl with a Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier Girl with a Pearl Earring is a 1999 historical novel written by Tracy Chevalier. Set in 17th century Delft, Holland, the novel was inspired by Delft school painter Johannes Vermeer's painting Girl with a Pearl Earring. Chevalier presents a fictional account of Vermeer, the model, and the painting. The novel was adapted into a 2003 film of the same name and a 2008 play. Sixteen-year-old Griet lives with her family in Delft in 1664. Her father has been recently blinded in an accident, and the family's precarious economic situation forces Griet's parents to find her employment as a maid in painter Johannes Vermeer's household. Becoming a maid casts doubt on Griet's respectability because of the bad reputation that maids have for stealing, spying and sleeping with their employers. It is not revealed how much of this reputation is earned. At the Vermeers, she befriends the family's oldest daughter, Maertge, but is not on good terms with Cornelia, one of Vermeer's younger daughters. She also becomes friendly with Tanneke, the other house servant, but is careful to remain modest and unobtrusive for fear of making Tanneke jealous. ... تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2001میلادی عنوان: دختری با گوشواره مروارید؛ نویسنده: تریسی شوالیه؛ مترجم: گلی امامی؛ تهر��ن، نشر چشمه، 1380 در 237ص؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان آمریکایی بریتانیا - سده 20م عنوان: دختری با گوشواره مروارید؛ نویسنده: تریسی شوالیه؛ مترجم: طاهره صدیقیان؛ تهران، کتابسرای تندیس، 1381، در 269ص، شاب��9789645757401؛ نقاشی روی جلد کتاب را، «یوهانس ورمیر»، در سده ی هفدهم میلادی کشیده است، حدس‌ها برای شناسایی نام این مدل نقاشی، بسیار گسترده بوده؛ و همه ی آنها، به علت عدم وجود مشخصه‌ ای ویژه، در «صورت»، «لباس»، یا حتی «محیط»، در حد حدس و گمان، باقیمانده‌ است؛ از جمله ی حدسها، به «ماریا ورمیر (دختر بزرگ یوهانس)»، «مدلینا ون رویژون (دختر دوست و حامی یوهانس، پیتر ون رویژون)»، و یا مدل گمنامی، که در خانه ی «ورمیر» به عنوان پیشخدمت کار می‌کرد، میتوان اشاره کرد؛ جدای از همه ی این حسها و تفاسیر، این اثر نقاشی از معدود آثاری است، که الهامبخش بسیاری از نویسندگان، نقاشان و فیلمسازان در سده ها پس از شکل گیریش بوده‌ است؛ از جمله همین نویسنده «تریسی شوالیه» نیز تحت تاثیر همین نقاشی، این داستان را آفریده است؛ داستان در «دلف»، شهر محل اقامت نقاش، و خانواده‌ اش رخ می‌دهد؛ رمان جایی آغاز می‌شود، که «یوهانس ورمر» و همسرش «کاتارینا»، به خانه‌ ی پدر و مادر «گرت» می‌آیند، تا او را ببینند؛ آن‌ها به دنبال خدمتکاری برای خانه شان می‌گردند؛ پدر «گرت» کاشی سازی است، که بر اثر حادثه‌ ای، بینایی خویش را از دست داده، و از کار افتاده شده؛ خانواده‌ ی «گرت» در شرایط اقتصادی بسیار بدی به سر می‌برند، بنابراین تصمیم می‌گیرند، دخترک شانزده ساله، به عنوان خدمتکار، مشغول کار شود؛ «گرت» دختری مذهبی است، و از اینکه باید به خانه‌ ی کاتولیک‌ها برود، احساس چندان خوشایندی ندارد؛ خانواده‌ ی «ورمر» موافقت کرده‌ اند، او روزهای یکشنبه، به خانه ی خویش برگردد؛ در ادامه‌ ی داستان، «گرت» توجه ارباب را به خود جلب می‌کند، و اجازه پیدا می‌کند، کارگاه نقاشی ارباب را، تمیز کند؛ از آنجایی که «یوهانس ورمر» اجازه‌ ی ورود اعضای خانه، به کارگاهش را نمی‌دهد، این مسئله، حساسیت برانگیز می‌شود؛ تا اینکه نقاش، تصمیم می‌گیرد، پرتره‌ ی دخترک را نقاشی کند، او از «گرت» می‌خواهد گوشواره‌های مروارید همسرش را، بیاویزد، و به جای مدل بنشیند...؛ نقل از متن: (حرف‌هایش باعث حیرت من شد، اما وقتی به چشمانش نگاه کردم، و در آنها گرسنگی را دیدم، دریافتم که چرا غرورش را، کنار گذاشته است، این گرسنگی را، پسر یک قصاب می‌توانست بر طرف کند دست کم در مورد دروغی که جلوتر گفته بودم؛ سئوالی نکرد؛ نمی‌توانستم به آنها بگویم، چرا «تانِکی» از من عصبانی است؛ آن دروغ، دروغی بسیار بزرگتر را پنهان می‌کرد؛ مجبور می‌شدم بیش از اندازه توضیح دهم؛ «تانِکی» فهمیده ‌بود بعد از ظهرها که می‌بایست مشغول خیاطی باشم، چکار می‌کنم من به ارباب کمک می‌کردم دو ماه پیش شروع شده بود؛ بعد از ظهری در ماه ژانویه، کمی بعد از تولد «فرانسیسکو»؛ هوا سرد بود؛ «فرانسیسکو» و «یوهان» هر دو بیمار بودند؛ سرفه می‌کردند، و به سختی نفس می‌کشیدند؛ «کاتارینا» و دایه کنار آتش رختشویخانه به آنها رسیدگی می‌کردند، و بقیه ی ما نزدیک آتش آشپزخانه نشسته بودیم فقط او آنجا نبود؛ بالا بود؛ به نظر نمی‌رسید که سرما بر او تاثیر بگذارد کاتارینا آمد و در درگاه میان آشپزخانه و رختشویخانه ایستاد؛ گفت: «کسی باید به عطاری برود»؛ صورتش سرخ شده بود: «مقداری دارو برای پسرها می‌خواهم»؛ مستقیما به من نگاه می‌کرد معمولا من، آخرین نفری بودم، که برای چنین کاری، انتخاب می‌شدم؛ رفتن به عطاری، مثل خرید از قصابی، یا ماهی‌ فروشی نبود، وظایفی که «کاتارینا»، پس از تولد «فرانسیسکو»، همچنان به عهده‌ ی من، گذاشته بود؛ عطار، پزشکی مورد احترام بود، و «کاتارینا» و «ماریاتین»، دوست داشتند، خودشان به آنجا بروند؛ چنین تجملی برای من، مجاز نبود؛ هرچند در هوای به این سردی، هر وظیفه‌ ای، به کم اهمیت‌ترین عضو خانه سپرده می‌شد؛ برای اولین بار، «مرته» و «الیزابت»، نخواستند مرا همراهی کنند؛ خودم را در شنل و شالی پشمی، پیچیدم، و «کاتارینا» به من گفت، از عطار، گل خشک اقطی، بخرم؛ «کورنلیا» در اطرافم می‌چرخید، و مرا تماشا می‌کرد، که گوشه‌ های شال را به هم گره می‌زدم...)؛ پایان نقل تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 04/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 25/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I approached this novel trepidatiously. How could I ever suspend my disbelief with this work? How could I ever believe such a ridiculous tale about Vermeer and one of his most revered paintings? I must admit that I opened this novel expecting to utterly detest the lies it weaves. By page two I realised that I was an idiot who should never be listened to. Griet is hired as a maid to the Vermeer family in Delft. This novel supposes that Griet the maid was the sitter for Vermeer's great work . However that is not the story, or at least it is only a small part of it. The novel mainly concerns the inner workings of the Vermeer household and Griet's attempts to keep everything in control. It is a fantastic character study and I do admire Chevalier's bravery in using the first-person narrative. Whilst I will admit that at times Griet's dialogue is somewhat stilted and some lines are just downright odd ('His smile made me grip my broom tightly' was one line that made me chuckle due to its utter ridiculousness), she is never an annoying or tiring character. I really enjoyed the subtlety and delicacy of the novel. The plot flows along nicely which causes you to really fly through the narrative. It is not a criticism that I often voice but I would have almost liked for this novel to be longer. I feel I will truly miss Griet. I must say that I am somewhat smitten with this novel. It genuinely surprised me. It's really great."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" by Tracy Chevalier was an interesting historical fiction concept! It was extremely cleverly how the author created Griet as the protagonist, maid and model for the famous painting 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. No one knows who the models were for any of Vermeer's paintings. So, I applaud this author's imaginative use of creating a story around the Master Painter's exquisite painting. Forced by her parents to become a maid to the Vermeer household, Griet is saddened to learn of the assignment. Hearing the news that she will reside with them and only be allowed to return home to her own family on Sunday's is heart wrenching for her. Regardless of her feelings, she diligently begins preforming her assigned duties of boiling, scrubbing, wringing, hanging and ironing the unmanageable heaps of laundry from this large and growing family. While the enormous pots of water are set on the fire to boil to begin the tedious laundering process, Griet often gets an early start on other assigned duties so no time is wasted during her long and exhausting days. However, Griet's most important duty as a maid in this household is the privilege of cleaning Vermeer's upstairs studio. To enter the artist's studio is considered an honor bestowed on few as the painter does not even allow his wife, Catharina, the freedom to enter. In cleaning the studio Griet is instructed that it is to remain exactly as the artist left it the previous day. If an item is touched to dust under it, it must be returned exactly as it was found. Failure to follow the rules set by the painter concerning his studio will cause her to be dismissed and sent away. Because Griet is allowed to enter Vermeer's studio, Catharina shows an immediate and obvious dislike for her. Her dislike transitions to jealousy and mistrust when the maid is asked by the painter to assist him in his studio attic for the process of grinding stones to create the colors for paints he plans to use. There seems to be an unspoken language, understanding and respect that develop between the painter and his maid concerning how they see light, color and the use of balance necessary for a finished painting. Griet is the planned model for a promised painting to one of Vermeer's older patrons who openly lusts after the young and innocent maid. As the painter nears the completion of the painting, he insists Griet wear Catharina's pearl earrings to add needed reflection of light to the painting. Although she agrees the painting needs the reflective light, Griet is hesitant to comply fearing the backlash from Catharina for wearing her earring. Griet finally relents but boldly insists Vermeer place the earring on her lobe. He does so with a sensual tenderness, touching her lobe, inserting the wire and pushing it through. Griet speaks of what takes place next: ""He did not remove his hand. His fingers brushed against my neck and along my jaw. He traced the side of my face up to my cheek, then blotted the tears that spilled from my eyes with his thumb. He ran his thumb over my lower lip. I licked it and tasted salt.” When Vermeer places the earring on Griet's lobe, she can only think of his fingers on her afterwards. It is clear she is infatuated by the quiet mystique of this painter. Perhaps he was also taken by her, discovering her ability to see the array of colors and light he sees in all things. Perhaps it was a longing of what could happen with the unleashing of forbidden desire. Vermeer chooses to move back to his easel and palette to finish the painting. A historical fiction novel, built around a famous painting, brought to life by the rich colorful written words from this author's palette. It is beautifully simple, where the unspoken, eye-holding looks that pass between Griet and Vermeer are suspended in air and left to the imagination of the reader. There is so much between the lines in this book one does not discover until many days after finishing. As I write this review, I continue to flip through the chapters and discover more and more that I missed on my initial reading. This is a masterpiece I will continue to savor forever!"
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"So the parts when Vermeer was actually being a painter were interesting. Seeing as I slogged through this on account of a recommendation that arose from an art-class lecture on Vermeer, I was hoping that the art stuff would at least deliver. But it's not a good sign when a book's most compelling moments revolve around two people grinding pigments. And, no: ""Grinding pigments"" is not a euphemism for artist-bangin'. It is, quite literally, referring to the detailed descriptions of how paint was made in the days before those fancy metal tubes replaced pig bladders as the paint-storing vessels of choice. This was the most predictable book I've read in a while, and that includes the two graphic-novel series that are simply retelling stories I know well in a new medium. I knew exactly where the plot was going within the book's first dozen pages. Every subsequent thread was introduced with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the writerly finesse of a 14-year-old's first attempt at fanfiction. It was also pretty obvious what stereotype everyone was going to play from his or her very first appearance. There really isn't a multi-dimensional character in this book. I understand that the first-person voice is a limited perspective by its nature, and I would write it off as just that if the peripheral characters were the only flat archetypes, but even the narrator doesn't carry any convincing weight. Griet is the protagonist because she's the main character. And because all of the characters with whom she has scuffles are inexplicably bitchy. Not giving characters any real motivations, not making them behave and interact believably, and generally preferring to tell rather than show all contributed to making this whole book feel sloppy, underdeveloped and rushed. If ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was maybe 200 more pages of really hammering out the story and its players, maybe then it'd be a more satisfying read. At least it's mercifully quick and mostly painless at its current length. I say ""mostly painless"" because there are some groan-worthy lines showcased here: While more pages would have maybe benefited the plot, there is -- save for a control-freak editor -- that could have improved the prose itself. I could not get past the clunky writing. It didn't take me long to get violently annoyed by the author's fondness for hitting the reader over the head with the most obvious attempts at subtle foreshadowing by way of forcing too much weight on these flimsy, laughably ominous one-sentence paragraphs. There were numerous other technical things that kept grating on me about the writing and its myriad shortcomings. Among them: Griet saying things like ""I always regretted that decision"" to indicate that she's looking back on a time that is very clearly written as the present; not one character shows any development throughout the novel; sixteen-year-old Griet, the daughter of a tile painter, somehow knows more about painting and composition than Vermeer, a professional artist who actually managed to garner some fame during his living years. Even when the book pissed me off (which was often), I will admit that I never found Griet herself to be irritating (maybe because I kept fantasizing about Scarlett Johansson to save my brain from oozing through my ears?) -- but I was irked at how it felt like Chevalier was Mary Sue-ing her way through the character. The way that every man whom Griet encountered in the whole! damn! book! fawned over and flirted with her, the way she was presented as being uneducated but naturally clever just because she sometimes spoke her mind and separated her chopped veggies by color, the way Griet's family was painted as these simple, sheltered little Protestants who knew nothing of the world around them.... there was far too much black-or-white for me to take anything about the book seriously. I don't care enough to write about this book any more. So. Every other gripe I have notwithstanding, here are three of the book's most glaring failures: -- Vermeer, for being the central male character, remains an enigma. It's not that he's shrouded in an air of charming mystery but rather that his personality is nothing more than a bunch of suppositions that Griet ""just knows"" about him. -- . Not. Once. It made her sound like a starstruck teenybopper and it undermined any sense of genuine affection between the painter and his maid. -- The similes. Oh, dear sweet Baby Jesus, the similes. I now know that I have a limited tolerance for the number of trite comparisons of faces and voices to household objects that I encounter in one novel, all thanks to the time I spent reading this book."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest Tracy Chevalier has been inspired by the artwork of Johannes Vermeer, and his most famous painting, the Girl with a Pearl Earring, that she decided to write a story of what she believes might have happened behind that painting. For me, when looking at paintings, this is one of the things that cross my mind – what is the actual story behind it, what was the relationship between the painter and the people on the painting, what were they all thinking and what did their lives look like… In this book, we are able to enter this world, where we see a story of what might have happened here, and this story is a wonderful experience. This is a story about Griet’s life. Griet lives in a house with her poor family, a blind dad who worked all his life to gather a bit of money for them, and a mother that always fought for the family. With their money running low, Griet has to go and work as a maid in the house of Vermeer, who is a famous painter. Even though quite young, Griet quickly knows her tasks, to iron, to cook, to grab groceries from the market, and the most important bit – to stay out of everyone’s way and do her job. In the house, things are not easy. Griet is not treated with respect, her family is worried about her, the plague kills her sister and the butcher’s boy wants to marry her. Griet doesn’t feel anything for this boy, but having meat on the table every day for her and her family is too big of an advantage to be just thrown away. I personally never liked the butcher boy, because he knew very well what his advantage was, and he kept reminding Griet how she depends on him to feed her family. But Griet has a secret crush on Mr. Vermeer, and a great admiration for his work. And Mr. Vermeer notices Griet’s curiosity and gives her tasks around the studio, which in the end, results in him painting her. Griet gets to be involved in his world, learning what he does, and working for him in secret, while his wife is bearing another child of his. Even though Griet secretly feels like she is betraying the wife, she can’t help but feel joj when Vermeer pays attention to her. Now, in the 21st century, it is normal for ladies to pose, and be painted, but in that time, it was a disgrace for a maid to be painted. Men didn’t have the respect towards women as they do now (some of them). And when Griet finds herself being painted, she knows the consequences, but as a maid, she has no voice to object. She knows this quite well. I have read the 20th Anniversary Edition of this amazing book, which was kindly sent to me by the publishers, The Borough Press, and Love Reading UK, in exchange for my honest review. | | | |"
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Vermeer's famous painting, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, allows Tracy Chevalier to imagine a special relationship between the painter and Griet, a young and pretty servant committed to the family's service. Unfortunately, proximity could make one think that the young servant served as a model for the painter of the painting, arousing Vermeer's wife's jealousy and causing a scandal in the Delft of the 17th century. Well, it captured the painter's universe and the Dutch society of his time; I agree with this story despite everything. The one who nicknamed the ""Sphinx of Delft,"" as his biography long remained obscure, and who painted only thirty-four pictures, some of which have become among the most famous in the history of painting, deserved better than this romance. However, Griet is not Tess d'Urberville, and Tracy Chevalier is not Thomas Hardy."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A reread. 4.5 Stars! Griet had not been told that she is to become the painter Vermeer’s maid, her mother only revealing the job to her after the Vermeer’s had already been, inspected Griet, and left. Griet has no say in the matter. Her father was a tile painter before a tragic accident, in which a kiln explosion claimed his eyes and trade. The family who were already struggling, treading water, now find themselves slowly slipping beneath the surface. Her father explains to Griet that she is to be a maid for the famous painter Vermeer. Cleaning his studio will be one of her main tasks. It is 1664, in the city of Delft, Holland. Griet has been brought up a protestant but the Vermeer’s are catholic and Griet wonders how life will change and what differences she will find in a Catholic household. The first time she sees the painting that Vermeer is currently working on, she is struck with awe. She has never seen anything like it in her life before. On the Sunday that she has free and returns to spend with her family she describes the painting for her father. These Sunday visits are soon taken from Griet as the area in which her family live is quarantined with word spreading that the plague has surfaced in the vicinity. She finds out from Pieter, the son of the butcher where she purchases the meat, that her parents are well but that her sister Agnes has taken ill. Pieter is a cheerful gregarious chap and falls for Griet. He does not hide his feelings and makes his intentions known to Griet. Griet tells him that she is only seventeen and has no feelings for him, however this does not dissuade Pieter. Griet’s parents decide, with Pieter being the son of a butcher, that he is a good match for Griet and invite him for dinner. Griet feels that she is helping the family by playing her role in securing their future, and a marriage could lead them out of penury. However, she is doing this out of family duty and harbours no feelings for Pieter other than friendship. One day Pieter tells Griet that Vermeer had a child with one of the maids in his painting. Alarmingly she asks him what happened to the maid. He answers her with, Before the quarantine is lifted Griet receives the terrible news that her sister has passed. Griet is grief-stricken. At first Griet barely sees Vermeer. He is nearly always locked away in his studio studiously painting. One morning the baker’s daughter is ill and Vermeer asks Griet to stand in for her in a painting he is working on. From this day on, Griet and Vermeer grow closer. Vermeer starts showing Griet how a painting is created from scratch. Griet, is utterly entranced. She has never seen a painting being painted, never met a master painter before. Her feelings start to grow stronger for Vermeer with each passing day. Griet shows an unusual talent for colour and arrangement and Vermeer is quietly surprised and happy. Vermeer then teaches her how to mix paints but as she grows closer to Vermeer, she becomes aware that all this can be taken away from her in an instant. Vermeer’s wife knows nothing of this work Griet is doing for him. Griet becomes used to this new way of life and it is not until Maertge, the eldest daughter, tells her that she is going to be moved from the attic, where she mixes the paints, back to the cellar, that she realises what she will be missing. While Griet has been working at the Vermeer’s household she has picked up an unwarranted admirer. A powerful, and rich admirer. He is Vermeer’s patron van Ruijven and he has his eyes set on Griet. Although Vermeer is a famous painter, the household is in debt. Vermeer’s extreme slowness in painting leaves him with only a few paintings to sell each year. So, when his patron van Ruijven requests that he paint Griet, Vermeer has little choice but to comply. Griet is trapped, she does not want to sit for the painting, but Pieter sums up her situation in a sentence, The painting of Griet has an almost pornographic taboo feel to it. It feels as if lines have been crossed and that boundaries have been broken. There is no illusion that Griet thinks she is in love with Vermeer. Griet is seventeen and naïve, apart from Pieter she has never been courted by a man and is blithely unaware of her beauty. When Vermeer sees Griet with her hair down, freed from the cap that has always remained on her head. He realises that he may be falling in love himself. There is always a sexual tension, almost like a charge of electricity, between the two. But will this tension result in action? And if the two do engage in a clandestine affair whare does that leave Griet? What hope is there for her? She is placed in an impossible situation with no positive outcome in sight. This novel makes the reader think about the relationship between master and servant. How Griet, only seventeen and very naïve, is caught up in the grey area that exists between the two roles. She sways back and forth like a ship in a storm, one minute reminded of her humble life while working on the household tasks, then a completely different world, mixing colours and helping Vermeer with his painting. Griet’s place in the Vermeer household is never secure, she seems to be always teetering of the verge of being thrown out with Vermeer himself the only tether keeping her safe. How is Griet going to get herself out of this situation, and is she more than just the naïve country maid that everybody thinks she is? This was a reread for me and it has lost nothing in the years since I read it. Not much is known about Vermeer during these years, so Chevalier had a great deal of license to play around with, and she has done a wonderful job, creating a believable and enjoyable novel. 4.5 Stars."

September 2022 is ""Historical Fiction Month"" for me. Another story based on a piece of artwork (think by )! Author 's research effectively took me back in time to the Dutch Golden Age of the 1600s. I felt like I was living along the streets and canals of Delft, Holland, seeing the tile makers working at their kilns, and meeting famed artist, Johannes Vermeer as well as other notable Dutchmen. The view of the art world, including famous paintings, visualizing colors in various objects, and learning about the intriguing methods for making paint were all vividly described. Why do authors insist on using the trope of making the wife such a b*tch in order for the reader to rally behind the ""innocent"" poor girl? In this story, fictional MC, Griet, because of her attention to detail, is hired to assist Vermeer by cleaning his studio, among other household chores. It may surprise many readers, but I had more empathy for Vermeer's wife, Catharina, than I did for that young upstart! First of all, Griet comes across as pretty ""high-falutin'"" for an uneducated maid, not only in her speech, but she even makes suggestions to Vermeer on how he should paint a scene! But because of all the weird ""secrecy"", I could clearly imagine what was going through Catharina's mind when she saw that painting! Besides the rage at seeing earring in this girl's ear, the idea of ""Just what the h*ll was going on between my husband and her?"" would be first and foremost in her thoughts. Griet was constantly imagining that Vermeer had the hots for her, so I had to laugh when she thinks that Catharina distrusts her ""for no particular reason""! Ha! Call it women's intuition, because ALL the women didn't like her (yet ALL the men are infatuated with her.) And what was up with her being so afraid to show her hair? I expected something heartbreaking, but nope! She just has long, luxurious hair. Whoopee! Overall, Griet's actions and reactions to various characters and situations were not only unlikable, but so over-the-top unbelievable! And as for Vermeer's character - he is such an enigma! Although I saw glimpses of his artistic vision, I would have liked his character to be more fleshed out. Chevalier chose an interesting premise by creating a story about this so-called ""Dutch Mona Lisa"". Her graphic descriptions of 17th century Delft, Holland were so lifelike. I only wish her ""stock"" characters were true to life as well. I was really hoping to love this story! Two ⭐⭐ = okay read = I'll be donating this to my library's book sale! Read this book if you like: - light historical fiction; - artistic creations using color and light; and/or, - young things chasing after your man!"

The popular fame obtained by this book and its subsequent movie version starring Scarlett Johansson... *two hours later* (Sorry, I was daydreaming)...had me expecting a tumultuous romance, a grab-ya and hold-ya reading experience. But this...I don't know what was, but it wasn't exciting in the least. is about a maid, who becomes a model, who gets her picture painted and attracts the notice of a few men. The painter is famous, so that's interesting. His patron is rich, of course, and expects to get what he wants, so there's your villain...kind of. Really, our protagonist's main enemy is jealousy. But that enemy's effectiveness is quashed by another force: money. And that leaves us with a less dramatically, emotionally affecting book. I read through to the end, expecting something bigger to happen the whole way, but even though it never did, I did still manage to get through it all, so there's something to be said for that. In the end, however, this book has to say about as much as does a picture of a beautiful woman. Not much. My overly sensitive and irrational wife would like me to take down my Johansson picture collage homage from the ceiling over our bed. But as I've explained, ScarJo needs the support of her #1 fan!"
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Girl with a Pearl Earring Tracy Chevalier Plume, 2001 The “Girl with a Pearl Earring” is a painting done by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, around 1665. Not much is known about Vermeer which gives Chevalier creative license to develop what I believe is an interesting story. The painting is currently on exhibition in New York, at the Frick Collection. The exhibition is scheduled to be there until January 19, 2014. The story told in first person by Griet the protagonist starts in Delft (South Holland), in 1664, when she was sixteen (16). Griet is the daughter of a tile painter who has recently lost his sight. Griet parents hired her out as a maid to the Vermeer family. Griet was expected to help out her family by bringing home the fruits of her labor. In the first few pages of the book there is considerable change in this family. The father has lost his sight, her brother Frans (thirteen (13)) has left home to start an apprenticeship, now Griet is leaving home to work. Her younger sister Agnes is upset because she will be without both siblings. Griet is concerned because her family is Protestant and while the Vermeer’s are Catholic. When the Vermeers visits Griet’s house to determine her suitability for the job as maid they each looked at her differently. Catharina, Vermeer’s wife was concerned about Griet’s physical ability to perform the job while Vermeer noted how she had laid out the vegetable she was cutting up for a stew separating them by color, in a circular pattern. The Vermeers have five (5) children with one on the way. Vermeer’s mother-in-law, Maria Thins, also lives in the house. There are a couple of other servants who assisted in running the household, which gave room for more conflicts in the story. Griet’s main job is doing the laundry and cleaning Vermeer’s studio, but, she also helps with the kitchen and taking care of the children. Griet was challenged by many conflicts primarily with Catharina, Cornelia (one of the children), and Tanneke (a long term servant). She also has to fight off Vermeer’s patron, van Ruijven. He is married but has a reputation for chasing young maids. Griet later took on more responsibility which included purchasing food for the family. She noted that the Vermeer family use Pieter for their butcher. She was to shop for the family daily and purchase the meat for the day. Pieter had a son who showed interest in Griet, which was at first not returned. Griet showed interest in Vermeer’s painting and asked him questions which he seemed to encourage. He later showed her how he made his colors for his paintings. Griet later became the subject of a portrait which he was commissioned by van Ruijven to paint. I think the author struggled at times to write as a sixteen (16) year old would think. However, I enjoyed the book."

This novel about a pretty maid who appeared in one of Vermeer's paintings is easy to slip into, didn't ask much of me, and kept me entertained for a few days. Is it great literature? No. Was it turned into a decent movie? Yes. Would I recommend the book? Depends. The plot skips along well enough, and I enjoyed how the author invented stories for some of Vermeer's famous paintings. My copy was a deluxe edition that included pictures of his artwork, which I appreciated. However, the writing is competent but forgettable, and I didn't find any exceptional quotes to share. If you like light historical fiction or stories about artists, you may enjoy this. Or you could just watch the movie."

A quietly gripping tale of what might have been. The story is a fictionalised account of the circumstances surrounding the painting of Vermeer’s masterpiece ‘Girl with a pearl earring’. Griet, the central character, is a strong, honourable, modest and likeable character and the events that overtake her, because of the sensibilities of the age, are tense and exciting. The writing is smooth, exact and fluent. I would often flick to the cover to look at the painting, adding extra life to this great novel."

No? Then, have a look at it: I hadn't seen it until a few months ago, in a class I was taking at the university called “film appreciation”. My professor wanted to show us the movie that goes by the name of this painting because he wanted to illustrate some concepts present in the movie and many other things. Well, at the end of the movie, in the credits (yes, I read the credits; besides, the music was amazing), it said “based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier”, so I told my self “why, it was based upon a book, therefore I should read it”, and that's why I decided to read it. was an interesting book to read. First of all because it features a famous painter, Johannes Vermeer; secondly, because the story is narrated from their maid's point of view; and finally, because we get to see how society was back in the seventeenth century. The story follows Griet, a young girl who gets a job as a maid in Vermeer's house. Since she first came to the house, she is hated by her mistress, Tanneke (the other maid) and Cornelia (one of the uncountable children Catharina had), but she gained something far more precious. She gained Vermeer's interest. Our heroine –Griet— is one of those characters who develop in the course of the story. She starts from being completely innocent and shy, and grows from there. At the end, she's still innocent, but she has changed. She has a particular obsession in hiding her hair with a cap, because her not showing her hair makes her be herself. Without her cap, she is “one of those women”, and she is not like that. Vermeer is great. I loved him and his dedication. I also loved his relationship with Griet. It's not a romance, mind you, but it was obvious he cared for her, and the same applied the other way round. His personality was very intriguing too: He was always so calm and isolated from the world, even when there were many people in the same room as him. It always felt as if he was alone, and I don't know, that made him stand out. The writing is beautiful. Simply brilliant. You could feel as if you were present in 1600's Holland. The details were enough to please you, but they were not overwhelmingly enough to tire you. It was perfect. I'm glad I gave this book a try, because it surely deserved my reading it. A good fast read that will remain with me. I hope someday, when I'm older, I cross paths with this book again, because I would want to re-read it eventually."

It is easy to find her weak compared to today, but you must put yourself in her shoes. Tracy Chevalier does a phenomenal job of trying to make this happen for her reader. I wanted to fight for Griet and protect her from her 16-year-old naivete through the age of 18 through the majority of the story. She faces problems on all sides, especially in terms of male persuasion. But Griet is not without allies, even if their hands are tied in many ways. I am sure that Griet's story is not so dissimilar from many young girls of this time period, and I can completely understand her to need to take the only control she felt she had when all felt lost in the control of her own person, It wasn't until after reading this that I realized how much creative liberty Chevalier took from this painting and the created story behind it. Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on a painting of the same name painted by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, sometime around 1665. Chevalier decided to give a story to this girl where one was lacking, and it was well done. It is hard to know who this girl really was, but Chevalier did a fair amount of research into the time and location. Interestingly, she decided to go with Griet rather than a woman of higher standing. I wonder what a story would be if this were about a lady of a house instead. Overall, this was very well written, and the story wove its way into my mind. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5."

I'm glad I did. What a wonderful book-- captures the essence of a young girl's first infatuation and the disappointment of reality. It also captured the time period artfully-- and I loved the character of Griet and how she grew in the short time the book covered. I was slightly disappointed in the ending-- I think it would have been more powerful to leave the reader with the choice of which path Griet's life would take her. Another plus-- this was a quick read, despite the languid descriptions, it was only a few hundred pages-- perfect for turning off the TV early! (Reviewed 2/24/09)"

GIRL WITH PEARL EARRING is a beautiful story, engaging, well-drawn characters, art and historically interesting. The story is about one painting, a young girl who forces to works as a maid in Johannes Vermeer's house (1632-1675), a Dutch painter.

It provided me fascinating fodder, a really good read, and a good grade on my paper. This is a wonderful study in repression and tiny details. There are some beautiful passages. I absolutely love the study done of the character of Vermeer. At one point, a character tells Griet (the imagined Girl with a Pearl Earring) to be careful, since Vermeer does not see her, but rather the painting that she will make. The artist sees the world only as paintings, not as people. This is shown as incredibly selfish. He loves only those things that fit into his sense of light and shape and color and tone. He has no interest in that which does not add to his work. And it is for one reason only I will say that the movie was better than the book: that we are able to see his imaginings in front of him, rather than have them described. The movie was an endless series of portraits in motion, and a huge motif and focus on Vermeer's eyes. Colin Firth is known for his ability to play the quiet loner (see: Mr. Darcy) and it's brilliantly done here. Well cast, director. Well shot. It's one of my favorite movies. I do warn that it is incredibly quiet and intimate, and not a lot happens. Many people may be bored by it. But I think if you read this book in the first place you're the kind of person to like the movie."

WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, everyone I know?? I found the prose artificially concise (as if she had purposely limited her vocabulary by a factor of ten, or as if the narrator was Dutch but just learning English), the characters completely flat and unbelievable, and the rise in drama both ill-explained and uninteresting. I did not like or feel compassionate toward a single character, I didn't feel any catharsis about ANYTHING, and I understood nary a motivation. Chevalier set up the Vermeer household as a jealous, gossipy, backstabbing mess, yes -- but she shouldn't have expected that to explain why the main character felt she'd ""be ruined"" if the lady of the house found out that she was excelling at her job. And also, good god, please don't over-explain every single metaphor, image, and implication. ""The butcher said one thing, but I think he may have been implying another -- something I was meant to catch onto. I just wonder what it could be! Oh, perhaps..."" just doesn't sit so well with me. I understand what the butcher said. If the narrator is as unflinchingly, humorlessly intelligent and perceptive as she is made out to be, she understands too. This is literature-lite. I kept turning the pages, and I did enjoy the time spent on my butt, eating cookie dough, with the book in my lap -- but the awkward prose never let me engage with the story enough to stop criticizing it."

Even though the novel spans more than a decade, not too much of note happens besides Vermeer's painting. The book is more like an historical account of an ordinary life with occasional excitement sprinkled in. I got a little bored at times. I thought Tracy Chevalier spent too much time describing commonplace objects and scenes (washing clothes, dusting, shopping) and not enough time giving insight on Griet's character and the household drama. However I was never so bored that I considered DNFing this book. The plot was always moving forward, even if it was subtle. I adored the author's prose. She liked comparing intangible concepts to tangible objects. For example: Those similes and metaphors were very well done. Tracy Chevalier did a wonderful job of centering the story around Vermeer by only ever referring to him with pronouns. Griet would think of Vermeer solely as ""he"" (or very rarely ""my master"", but his name) and it gave the impression that Vermeer was the only man in the world to Griet. The author never outright stated Griet's feelings for Vermeer in the book, but made them clear through occasional hints: There were many aspects of Girl With a Pearl Earring that the reader had to infer from hints. It wasn't an easy read but still a very good one."

Griet is competent, intelligent and observant. She possesses the laudable ability to maneuver 17th century Delft in a shrewd and practical manner while still retaining her love of art; finding beauty in even mundane things. Griet has a first-rate mind, concealed in the body of - essentially - a peasant. This poor maid is the only person who truly understands Vermeer's work. The relationship she develops with the painter is satisfyingly subtle; a nuanced understanding which never falls into the trap of passionate declarations or overwrought pining. In fact, the thing I like about Griet the most is that she never even flirts with self-pity or self aggrandizement. She knows who she is. This book is the most successful(and in my opinion the best)of Tracy Chevalier's fictional works, which focus on the lives connected to the production of famous works of art. I do not recommend the movie, however. Scarlett Johanssen plays Griet like someone not used to housework, Colin Firth's Vermeer obtusely has puppy dog eyes for Scarlett, and Cillian Murphy is just too Metro to be believed."

It's like a chilli con carne without chilli - just mince and rice, because that's really all it is without the kick and this book had no kick whatsoever. Secondly, the setting begins in Netherlands 1664, then jumps about a bit and ends in 1676. That sounds like an amazing, unique setting for a novel, does Chevalier make use of it? Nope. Most of this novel is set inside the house, whenever she goes somewhere, like the 'Meat Hall', there's hardly anything described between them or on the way. This book felt as if it had about three sets and they weren't connected at all, just floating in some weird ether. Why wouldn't you take advantage of trying to conjure up the Netherlands in the 17th century? How interesting would that be? Finally, it took most of the book to get to the thing the book is 'about'. I felt as if I read 200 pages of being a maid, washing and drying and hanging things out. I didn't care for the main character, or any of them. She even made Vermeer boring. In conclusion: chilli con carne sans chilli."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},what an amazing historical fiction novel! i loved the creative liberties tracy chevalier took when creating a life and story behind the girl with the pearl earring paining. i’m so lucky to have seen her in real life yesterday in den haag at the mauritshuis! it was beautiful and i loved thinking of the painting as griet from this book!!!

I don't say that often enough about a book. I was impressed with the writing, completely invested in the story and pleased with the ending. It's not easy to tick all those boxes, especially in a relatively short story. What more can I say."

This book took me awhile to get into this book, but after I really got into the book I could not put it down. This book basically follows a young girl. I really felt the character came to life while reading this book. This is moving building story and slow moving, but I did enjoy it. There was times while I was reading this book that I wish it would move along a little bit faster. I won a paperback copy of this book from a goodreads giveaways, but this review was 100% mine own opinion."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is gorgeously written. I love that Chevalier makes up all these lives to give a back story to just this one painting. Well, that's not true. We actually see the painting of three or four of Vermeer's 35 through Griet's eyes. I know that I had to constantly pull up images of his paintings as I read to actually see what Griet was describing. I must also say that I have never been much of a Vermeer fan, but having read about Vermeer through Griet's eyes, I see his paintings as much more complex and studied than I had before. I hope Chevalier got the process right because it would be a pity if he actually painted some other way. Vermeer hires Griet as a house girl for his wife and five children. The Vermeer/Thin family are Catholics and women of that standing do not nurse their own children so there are likely to be more and more children. Griet is sorely needed. Vermeer and his wife Catherina come to Griet's home to meet her and the initial meeting comes across more as his hiring her for his own mysterious ""pleasure"", but when Griet arrives in their home she truly is a house girl. Nothing else. It takes much time for Vermeer to begin to use Griet to not only clean his painting studio but to eventually run painting errands, mix colors, help him ""see"" the painting in hiding, and eventually to model for him. Griet is the girl in the pearl earring. An earring, in a previously unpierced ear, belonging to Catherina. Talk about a scandal in the making. There is more to the story. Griet's family falls on sad and hard times. Griet is wooed and eventually married by a nice young man, but none of that matters. The painting is the thing and Chevalier brings this (and other) paintings to life in a way I have never before experienced. I would compare this book to the Doctor Who episode ""Vincent and the Doctor"". We care about the art because we are made to care about the artist. Chevalier does a beautiful job of this."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Strange that I have never read this before, nor have I seen the film. I don’t know much about Vermeer but as I was reading this I kept looking at the paintings online as they were described. I loved the detail about the lighting,techniques, the colours , how the colours were made. Griet, a teenage maid becomes the model for his most famous painting . Told from her point of view , the hard work of the maids in a household is told in detail. Sounds boring but I was engrossed, as her fascination with the painter grows (her master, though she finds it hard to name him), and he in turn is fascinated by her as she also seems to have an eye for what works in his paintings. This was well written, and the attention to detail including customs (paternity cap!), religion, clothing, the markets etc was wonderful."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Gorgeous painting, deeper appreciation of art; mediocre, annoying book This is a book that fictionalizes what might have been behind the famous Vermeer painting, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". Griet's family is destitute, and now she must work as a maid in the Vermeer household, cleaning up the famous painter's workstation. Slowly, she grows more interested in her master, and her master in her. I am not what you would call an artsy person. I make an effort to decorate my home nicely, I can pick out nice yarns for knitting and crocheting (according to a pattern), and I am fairly decent at picking clothes that don't clash, but that is as far as my ""artistic abilities"" go. You wouldn't find me in an art museum for fun, unless my sister, the artsy one in the family, drug me there. So when I say that this book made me look up Vermeer, analyze his work, and actually grow more appreciative of it, I think it's a somewhat big deal. And, though I really hate to say this, that is the biggest reason I am giving this book two stars. Because a book that makes me look up a historical figure, investigate his work, and actually start to like it deserves to have SOME kudos. If you take that aspect of the book away, you are left with a medicore book, populated with annoying/cliched characters with virtually no plot to speak of. Griet is our protagonist, and there were several times I was hoping she would drown in her washing or set herself on fire or accidentally fall between the butcher and his blade. I understand she's young, but I didn't realize she was A) a 10 year old child (she acts way younger, more sheltered, and more immature than her 17 years would indicate), B) a spoiled, wealthy child suddenly thrown into poverty (though her father lost his trade, I never got the impression they were wealthy before this book), or C) hideously emo (she tends to wangst about not seeing her parents, about the ""secrets"" she has to hide, and she faints after piercing her ear). Her first day working for the Vermeers, she whines that the first time she smiled all day is when she saw a familiar butcher's face. Booohooo. She is stupid, keeping an expensive comb anywhere within a 12 mile radius of a bratty child who wants to wreak havoc on Griet's life. She is dense as a brick, selfish, ungrateful, and unemotional (she is never shown loving or caring at all for Pieter, which makes the ending seem weird). And yet somehow, this girl garners the attention of THREE men and the hatred of SEVERAL women. She's better at cleaning, cooking, caring for Vermeer's studio, making paint, buying meat, AND arranging items in Vermeer's paintings (yes, it is SHE that comes up with the earring idea for the titular painting and rearranges the cloth for another painting). Griet, come on down, you've won the Mary Sue of the Month award! The other characters are two dimensional at best. Catharina is a b!tch, mean to Griet just because. I am really sick and tired of this cliche: of having the female of the house hate the ""poor girl"" just because, well, that's what the female of the house is supposed to do, I guess. I ended up feeling SORRY for Catharina, because I felt she was desperately trying to win her husband's attention by having so many children. Cornelia is a demon; her actions venture way beyond ""Terrible Child"" into ""Spawn of the Devil"". One character dies just to include some more angst and a thin relation to the Plague. Vermeer is a complete enigma. I can understand retaining some mystery around him, but when you finish the book with as many questions as you began, something is wrong. I have no idea what he saw in Griet, how he felt towards her, and who he was. Van Ruijven is a stereotypical CAD; Tenneke is stupid (she can't tell when Griet is sucking up to her?? Yeah, right!). Pieter started out a nice guy, but when he feels up Griet against her will, I just felt cold. Their entire relationship is awkward: he seems really keen on her, very nice, yet she wants nothing to do with him. But then, after Vermeer sees her hair loose, she is okay with having sex with Pieter??? Huh??? The story is so bland and stereotypical, it's absurd. How many times have we seen the ""X must take a job because X's father/provider can't work"" or something along these lines? It wouldn't be bad if there was SOMETHING to make it different, but Griet never gives an indication of what she is missing out on nor does her story make this plot line interesting. Instead, all she does is whine about how rough her hands are, how much her back hurts, how much work she has to do, how bloody the butcher is, how all the women hate her, etc. And what makes Griet so special that Vermeer pays her any mind? I got a glimpse when Griet arranges vegetables, and I actually liked a scene where Griet and Vermeer discussed colors in white, but other than that, there is nothing between them. Well, there IS Griet's feelings for Vermeer, but because I saw so little of Vermeer, I always got the impression she had a major crush on Vermeer and he was just smitten with her in an artistic sense. As for all the secrets...come on, people, what gives? Why is it such a big deal that Griet helping Vermeer create paint? Why do they go to such efforts to keep it a secret? Why the big deal about the painting Vermeer does of Griet? Is it because of the possibility of an affair? If so, why did Catharina have no problem with Vermeer painting the butcher's daughter or van Ruijven's family? Vermeer is painting her to get paid; you would think Catharina would have enough sense to be okay with that, but apparently, no! (In fact, if she were a REALLY interesting character, she might see Griet's painting potential and FORCE her to sit so they could make more money!) If people actually TALKED to each other, instead of hiding stupid things like this, there wouldn't BE a story. The ending actually isn't bad. I liked how she moved on and wasn't still harping (too much) on Vermeer. Though there were still a few things that bugged me (SPOILER FRIENDLY: her marriage, what she did with Vermeer's final gift to her). I suppose if you are really curious about Vermeer and his background and don't mind a fluffy, almost Young Adult approach to it, this is your book. But if Mary Sues, flat characters, and an almost non-existent story hold you back, you may want to skip. I will give this book credit: it was a fast listen (I ""read"" on audiobook) and made me more interested in the artist. UPDATE 9/12/11: I recently watched the movie starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth and was pleased at how well it was adapted to movie format. This isn't something I often say, but I definitely preferred the movie over the book."

I listened to the audiobook from Recorded Books, narrated by Ruth Ann Phimmister, who I thought brought something delicate and beautiful to the story that might not have otherwise been there. I very much recommend the audiobook version. This story is of Griet, a sixteen-year-old maid who enters the VanMeer household in 1664 to save her own struggling family. She faces many wordly obstacles for the first time: the hatred of other servant class members and their underhanded scrabbling for power and favor, her mistress's unfounded suspicion, even paranoia, which she embodies in accusations of theft, the lurid attention of powerful men who take what they want one way or another, and perhaps most importantly, her own characteristics to never stand for being abused. Her time as a maid, while transformative, is not definitive--or is it in a way? You'll have to decide for yourself, as the reader, when you encounter Griet's destiny, and her fate. I loved this book, and I loved it especially because the whole time I read it, I thought to myself, ""My mom would adore this book!"" She is a fan of the classic painters and paintings. (Come to find out, she has read it, and did enjoy it very much.) I was disappointed with the ending, as I found it anticlimactic for the character I had come to know in Griet. I am uncertain, however, that the frustration I felt at the end was not unintentional on Chevalier's part. It is indeed a remarkable novel and I recommend it.

Years of hauling water, wringing out clothes, scrubbing floors, emptying chamberpots, with no chance of beauty or color or light in my life, stretched before me like a landscape of flat land where, a long way off, the sea is visible but can never be reached. If I could not work with the colors, if I could not be near him, I did not know how I could continue to work in that house. Poor Griet just wants to anchor herself in the orbit of Vermeer and his otherworldly (but also beautifully ordinary) paintings, but circumstances and even Vermeer himself will come to make that impossible. Not much is known about Jan Vermeer's life. He married a woman from a wealthy family and converted to Catholicism (an unusual thing in 17th century Holland) and lived well, if beyond his means, for a time as a painter and art dealer. He lived in Delft, Holland all his life, rarely leaving it, and died in debt, exacerbated by the drop in patronage during the Franco-Dutch War, in 1675. He only painted 35 (or 34, depending who you read) paintings, with a few others whose attribution cannot be established. Because we don't know a lot about Vermeer's life (and much less about most of the young women who sat for him), this is a fictionalized imagining of how one of his most famous paintings came to be. When teenage Griet's father is blinded in an accident, she is sent to be a live-in maid at the Vermeer household. Life there isn't easy: Vermeer's wife takes an immediate disliking to her, one of the daughters is a malicious brat, the other maid resents her, Griet misses her family whom she now can only see on Sundays, the family is Catholic which her Protestant backbone finds vaguely distressing, and the work is back-breaking. What makes it bearable are the paintings. Griet, the daughter of a tile painter, has an eye for light and color. As she learns to mix raw materials to make his pigments and watches his subjects evolve daily on the easel, they develop a kinship. Alas, this also sows the seeds of her eventual departure. Poor Griet is too smart to be a maid and too lacking in other options. Like countless, nameless people throughout history, she is forced to work a job she hates and be entirely dependent on the capricious impulses of the wealthy. She is groped by Vermeer's patron, used as a pawn by Vermeer's mother-in-law, and ultimately seen as little more than a prop by Vermeer himself. I wasn't sure while reading this if it was a three or four star read, but I feel this book is going to stay in my head for a while so four stars, what the heck.

Brings to life Delft in 1664. How accurate was the period described, I don’t know, but it came across as true. The description of time and place added a layer of texture to the story, without detracting or distracting. The Vermeer household and associated lifestyle was all the more believable because of how it fit into the various classes within Delft society: better off than some, but still clearly struggling to make ends meet. Griet’s relationships with the various people in her life, the changes in those relationships and the machinations of the Vermeer household make for an engaging story. The story is appropriately like a wonderful painting, rich in details and layers. The other thing I got from this novel: I looked at Vermeer’s paintings. Amazing. I knew nothing about him or his work before."

Central character is a servant in the house of golden age Dutch painter Jan Vermeer and is used as the model for the painting 'Girl with a pearl earring'. Plainly the story has a niceness to it - the private story behind the public painting, but doesn't have anything more to offer than that. In a way I think it demonstrates the risks or the problem of historical fiction - which hating a void inserts itself in the lives of the obscure, creating a story, or explanations often were there is obscurity or indeed silence. Such stories like a Pseudoscience may not be disprovable - because so many lives are silent - but that does not mean they are true or plausible.

The story is subtle making it the perfect example that less is more in a story. Some of my thoughts as I read: 1. The society of the time classified everyone as a ""have"" or a ""have not"". For a girl who was in between it was a matter of time before she was forced to one side or the other. She never fit in either world. 2. Clearly this girl had a raw, undeveloped talent for art. Had she lived in a different century would she have been the artist instead of the muse? Her role was so defined she didn't even question the possibility herself. 3. The fictional Vermeer was a coward. I hope the real one was not. 4. I didn't blame the wife. Would you? She had eleven children and a husband who cruelly excluded her from his art. 5. Be careful of the passion you feel for a painter with OCD tendencies when you're eighteen--it never lasts. 6. She should have kept the earrings and worn them with pride. 7. The painting is captivating. 8. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the groping."

Griet's family is struggling financially as a result of her father's accident. In order to cope with the rigid social hierarchy, Griet carefully cleans, cooks, and monitors the busy everyday activities of the household. Vermeer gets captivated by her because of her humble nature and strong eye for detail, and she quickly finds herself dragged into the artistic world that he creates. Griet becomes the painter's improbable muse, assisting him with the preparation of his studio and with the mixing of paints. A mutual understanding between the two that develops in silence helps them to overcome their social differences. But this relationship doesn't go well with the other household members, especially with Vemeer's wife, Catharina. This is a well-written book that covers a very interesting era and revolves around an intriguing character. It fascinates me that the author drew inspiration from the painting and developed a tale that centers on the artist who created it. The book tackles many important themes from that period of time, be it social class, the nature of affairs back then, or how poverty used to be. Although the ending felt somehow ambiguous, it didn’t affect my enjoyment of this novel. If you read this novel and liked it, watch the movie adaptation because that one is fantastic too."

Speaking of it, I'm sure there were many details left out, it's hard now to tell which, but it was definitely an advantage to put a face on the characters. My interest in art over the years was quite inconsistent and I started by liking the modernists and surrealists, and by the time I met Vermeer I considered the Dutch masters (and many others for that matter) to be too old and classical for my taste. It was only in the last decade that I acknowledged them and still cannot put my finger on when I began to like Vermeer. Truth be told, is not a painting I particularly like, I tend to favour those that are sunlit, usually set in front of a window, like , or , which later led me to love in the most absolute way the Danish trio, Ilsted, Holsoe and Hammershøi and their ""Sunshine and silent rooms"". But back to the book. I don't remember if the Protestants VS Catholics issue was much focused on in the film version, but it was quite interesting to follow it throughout the book, and from what I've read, Chevalier's first novel went even deeper into it. I terribly liked how Vermeer was always , or for Griet and the Master and Servant relationship was very much to my taste! And I'm back to the film: having Colin's face and voice in mind really helped, sometimes my imagination needs help with faces but mostly voices. And now I must choose something as gripping as this or else I will end up struggling to finish Fry's memoir."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I went into this book hoping for an interesting read, nothing more. I have a BA in art history, and have studied art of the Dutch Golden Age in depth. However, I was not looking for a book to be accurate, or even very much about Vermeer. I just wanted a good story. This book isn’t even palatable. Griet, the narrator, is completely insufferable. She is full of contradictions, and not in the complex character way one would expect in a well written book—instead, she seems a collection of rather unrelated personality traits that barely hold together under the pressure of this novel. Griet manages to be completely naive and annoyingly worldly at the same time. She is somehow very humble, yet is about as arrogant and condescending as can be. She somehow is both modest and religious, yet remains in a state of sexual arousal for a married man for years on end. She is an unskilled, uneducated maid, but somehow has a better artistic eye than one of the most skilled artists to ever paint, and has to help him arrange his paintings. Her telling of the story seems so dramatic and over-wrought that it is hard to focus on anything but poor Griet and her drama most of the time. Even if Griet weren’t a complete turn-off, the rest of the novel would be. Other characters (with the sole exception of Maria Thins) are equally as confused and poorly written. Most characters seem to be thinly disguised motivations or plot devices, and at times I started to wonder if something much more philosophical was going on. Symbolism is laid on to an almost farcical extent—spinning knives, for example—and the build-up of plot moves from painfully slow to unsatisfying brisk. The climax seems completely rushed, and is somehow boring in both its blandness and predictability. The final portion of the story, set ten years later, seems to exist more as a bizarre plot twist and Mary Sue…I mean Griet getting even with everybody than as an integral part of the story. While the world it took place in seemed rather meticulously researched, it was presented in such a way that you almost felt the author was smacking you across the face with it—for example, a handful of articles of clothing were really well researched, but those were the only clothing mentioned and each was brought up a half dozen times in detail. Griet’s bonnet is accurate and wonderfully described. Nearly every woman would have worn a bonnet in 17th century Delft, but not once is anyone else’s headgear mentioned—excepting one passing reference to a pair of hats, and a comment on a man wearing a hat (as a way of identification). Yet since Griet’s bonnet was both an important symbol and plot device, we heard more about it than we could ever want. This book read like something an immature, first-time writer would create in an early draft—it has the elements of a good work, but lacks refinement, consistency, or a more advanced sense of style. I would expect this of a teenage girl who had watched the movie Secretary a dozen times, not by a (at least by reputation) talented author like Tracy Chevalier. I’ve seen the defense of many of these criticisms that Chevalier was leaving things intentionally vague given the lack of information about Vermeer’s life, but I don’t buy that. I've also seen that Chevalier was trying to create something other than a typical romance story of an artist falling in love with his muse/master of the house taking advantage of a maid. In the end, however, that is exactly what she wrote, and if she had just gone about it in the traditional way, it might have actually been interesting. I think this is a poorly written romance novel that uses a fig leaf of art history for publicity. In short—don’t read it. Read just about anything historical fiction instead. Pick a title at random, it is bound to be better."

Over 2 years a quiet and obedient maid named Griet goes to live as a servant for Johannes Vermeer and his family. It is hard for Griet not to like this good and obedient protagonist, for she struggles with universal yearnings such as love and an escape from poverty. Her life is a fairly solitary one as she finds herself growing apart from her family while living as an outsider in another's home. The Vermeer family, with the exception of the painter himself, is not fond of the strange Protestant girl; and as Maria Thins, the grandmother, says, ""Never so much trouble with a maid before."" The real trouble comes, however, when the artist takes a liking to the young girl and allows her to assist him in his work. Griet is granted the privilege that no other family member has -- helping Vermeer in his studio. Not even his wife Catharina is allowed to enter the studio, so this arrangement causes a great deal of tension within the household. Griet begins her work by cleaning still life objects that Vermeer will paint later that day. She also is given the responsibility of grinding the paints and even purchasing the colors from the apothecary. As if these ""privileges"" were not causing enough disquietude within the family, matters only get worse when Vermeer agrees, at a friend's request, to paint Griet. The moments in which Vermeer paints Griet are the most spellbinding of the book. We feel Griet's nervous emotions as she sits as still as possible under the close eye of the awe-inspiring man she has grown to love. Her inner struggle is augmented by jealous Pieter, the butcher's son, who has made no secret of his intention to marry Griet. The young maid, however, seems devoted only to her master and obeys his every wish. When he tells her to wear his wife's pearl earrings for the painting, Griet agrees even though she knows it could lead to her downfall. (Also really liked the 2003 film starring Colin Firth and Scarlet Johansson.) Vermeer (1632-1675) left no more than 36 paintings - and the attribution of a couple of those is in doubt - and no drawings. Vermeer was not a totally unsuccessful artist. He became a head of the Guild of St Luke in Delft and his paintings fetched high prices, but he died in debt, and his Catholic wife Catharina Bolnes had to declare herself bankrupt."

And by the way, if you're like me and say the names mentally as you're reading them, and you don't know Dutch, this book will be a challenge. As I said in my status update, this book reminded me of why historical fiction was one of my first loves. I think I read at least half the historical fiction books in my high school library. To be truthful, the plot of this one is something of a soap opera, but I enjoyed reading about everyday life of both rich and poor in the seventeenth century. If you like historical fiction, and especially if you enjoy art, I highly recommend"

I have read most of Tracy Chevalier's work so I appreciate her ability to craft a good story. After his death Vermeer and even his paintings fell into obscurity for two centuries, so Chevalier had a free hand to paint the fictional picture of the artist and the story surrounding the painting, The Girl With a Pearl Earring. She did so beautifully and with respect, to the muse, the artist, and the painting. The only romance in the novel was hinted at, but sometimes that makes it even more endearing. When you look at the face in the painting, it is easy to imagine it is a look of love that she is returning to the painter."

Well, try picking up this book. It should put you to sleep in 10minutes flat. The story about the most boring people in the world, told by a girl who has the most boring thoughts and ideas in history. Even while getting groped in the alley, she thinks of the clouds! I mean really!!! At times, I liked some of the description used, but at others it was so wrong I wanted to poke my eyes out and burn the book. Characterisation does not seem to be something Tracy is familiar with, all of the characters (including Griet, the protagonist) were flat and boring and stock standard. There is only one word I can use to describe this book: BORING!"

The need for Griet to be obedient and silent as a girl, a housemaid, and later as a model, makes visual observation her key feature as the narrator.

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Finished: Excellent writing. Each character was portrayed with depth. I kept thinking that I should quote this line or that, but this was impossible without giving spoilers. You must read the book to get into each of these characters and to submerge yourself into their lives. The book is not only about thes principal characters but also about what motivates an artist to create. Who is an artist? Isn't it someone who simply cannot stop himself from painting, or playing music, or sculpting shapes, or catching just the right image on the film, or simply a dancer who physically CANNOT stop dancing..... There is an urge within that is stronger than everything else. I am so sorry to close the book's covers and leave their world. Through page 152: I will start with a quote and then explain my thoughts: ""Whatever she saw or understood, she decided it was time to stir the pot once more (sir up trouble). For no particular reason but a vague distrust, she did not like me."" People tend to feel more at ease with some rather than others. All of us tend to like some particular type of person over another. There is nothing strange about that. But my question is why do some people have to cause trouble for those they for some inherent reason simply don't like? The movie was a total failure in its ability to convey the causes of the characters' emotional undercurrents. It is the examination of these undercurrents that makes this story so marvelous. The movie was very pretty, yes, but that's all. I remember specifically leaving more confused and empty after seeing the movie. Sort of with the question: what was that all about on my lips?! The book has enticed me to go to Delft and see the city where Vermeer worked. It is only 1.5hr from here. This is a ""must-do"" now. I love the book. I wonder what I will find out. And OMG some people are yucks! Through page 106: What is the relationship between Vermeer and the maid Griet? THAT is the primary question underlieing this book. This is made clear in the foreword. It arises b/c the painter has managed to make the expression of Griet so intriguing - is she sad, thoughtful, enticing or laughing. Look at the painting and you can see several emotions. So what is going on between the master and the model - some relationship must exist, but what exactly is the nature of that relationship? Known historical facts are lacking. We can only hypotehsize and make conjectures, but thinking about the possibilities is the impetus that caused Tracy Chevalier to write this book. Here follows a quote: ""Sleeping in the attic made it easier for me to work there(near the studio), but I still had little time to do so.I could get up earlier and go to bed later, but sometimes he gave me so much work that I had to find a way to go up in the afternoons, when normally I sat by the fire and sewed. I began to complain of my not being able to see my stitchinging the dim kitchen, and needing the light of my bright attic room. .....I began to get use to lying."" ""Once he suggested that I sleep in the attic, he left it to me to arrange my duties so I could work for him. He never helped by lying for me, or asking me if I had time to spare for him. He gave me instructions in the morning and expected them to be done the next day."" ""The colors themselves made up for the troubles I had hiding what I was doing. I came to love grinding the things he brought from the apothecary....I learned that the finer the materials were ground, the deeper the color....Making it and the other colors was magical."" From this quote you taste the simplicity, the calmness of the language. You see the love and interest Griet had for the paints and their colors. Questions arise about Vermeer - how could he fail to understand that his additional work demands pushed Griet into an awkward position and even jeopardized her employment in the household? Through page 36: You are right there, in Delft, Holland , mid-1600s. You smell it - the food cooking, the linseed oil in the painting room; you feel the fabrics, the air on your skin; you hear the sound of washing and ironing and cooking pots boiling and children playing and you see all the details you've seen when looking at paintings of this time period. Absolutely marvelous depiction of all the household items, market squares and canals and the paintings hung in every room of Vermeer's house. You feel Griet's fear of the paintings depicting Catholic beliefs - she is Protestant and there remain few Catholics in Delft after the Spanish were defeated. You know I was putting off reading this b/c I was scared that I would be disappointed. Everybody praises this book and as long as I didn't read it I could stick to the belief that I would probably like it too. I didn't want to loose that hope, so I put it off! Dumb huh?! Well, I am not at all disappointed. Make sure you read the deluxe paperback version; it has beautiful pictures and an excellent foreword by the author."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Most of us know the painting, if not by name, but by sight at least. You might have even watched the movie starring Colin Firth (!!) and Scarlett Johanssen. Many of us might have heard of Johannes Vermeer, the artist behind this painting. But have you ever wondered, who is the girl in the painting? What is her story? What lies behind that indecipherable expression? Ever since I read The Birth of Venus by Sarah Dunant, I have loved books which involve art and artists. I don't claim to have much knowledge about art, but as a layperson I can say that the book, Girl With a Pearl Earring is evocative and mesmerizing. Johannes, Jan or Johan Vermeer (1632-1675) was a Dutch painter who specialized in exquisite, domestic interior scenes of middle class life.The painting Girl with a Pearl Earring is one of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's masterworks and as the name implies, uses a pearl earring for a focal point. Today the painting is kept in the Mauritshuis gallery in the Hague. It is sometimes referred to as ""the Mona Lisa of the North"" or ""the Dutch Mona Lisa"". (Source: Wikipedia) Girl with a Pearl Earing by Tracy Chevalier is the story of Griet, a young girl who is sent to work at Vermeer's house as a maid. Her father is no longer able to support the family, following an accident that leaves him blind. As a result, Griet is uprooted from all that she has known to a completely unfamiliar environment. Griet is in charge of cleaning Vermeer's studio, a place where hardly anyone, not even his wife Catharina, is allowed to enter. For Griet, the studio is like a mysterious and enchanted land. Even before she has met him, she is drawn to Vermeer and his paintings. Soon, Vermeer is enamored by this quiet and scared young girl. Thus, starts the journey towards Vermeer's most celebrated painting. Girl with a Pearl Earring is a fascinating portrayal of the mystery behind the painting. Somehow, reading this book, makes the painting more magical and beautiful in my eyes. Perhaps, the actual story will forever remain unknown but Tracy Chevalier's take is enough to satisfy one's curiosity about the painting. I felt for Griet right from the start. Griet, in her innocence, unknowingly causes conflict within Vermeer's family as the artist's obsession with her grows. At the same time, she's as captivated by him, as he by her. One of my only problems with the book is that the author fails to create a very vivid portrayal of 17th century Delft. However, there's so much eloquence and passion in the way the author describes Vermeer, his paintings and his relationship with Griet, that it's easy to overlook any flaws. The book's premise is what won me over and kept me engaged throughout. One of the best parts about the book are the diverse characters. There's the mysterious Vermeer, his jealous bitter wife, Catharina and his powerful, controlling mother-in-law, Maria. The author has depicted the power-play, class system, poverty, the terrible conditions of the poor, religious prejudices and women's position in 17th century Holland. It may seem like a simple story, but it has so many complexities. There's so much left unsaid between Griet and Vermeer that it breaks your heart. Till the end I kept on asking myself - What is it between the two of them? It did not seem like love to me, but more like an intense longing and desire. I think everyone will have their own take on this. The movie, I think, captures the beauty and sensuality of the book. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most book-to-movie adaptations. According to the author : (Source: Tracy Chevalier's Website) Overall: An entrancing take on the story of the girl in Vermeer's most famous painting Recommended: Yes! Historical Fiction fans will enjoy this."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I've seen many mixed reviews about this book over the years. Like many people, I admire Vermeer's (few) works and enjoy reading historical fiction, so it was just a question of time before I settled down with the novel. I'd seen the movie adaptation years ago and found it excellent. Some readers fault this novel for lacking depth. I didn't set high expectations, and looked forward to getting an insiders view into the masters household and studio. Greet is a young protestant girl who must find work as a maid after her father is blinded and cannot continue to support the family as a guild member in the tile works. She has a fine eye for capturing detail, colour and light, something which Vermeer catches in her from the way she's arranged a plate of chopped vegetables in preparation for a stew. Going to work as a maid is unpleasant to Greet, but doing so in a Catholic family where there are paintings of crucifixions and religious subjects is all the more jarring to her. And of course there are the women of the house to contend with. While master sees potential in Greet as a studio assistant, eventually helping him mix colours and sort his things with a delicate touch, the painters wife isn't happy about having a pretty young maid in the household, and Greet must do her household duties and double as an assistant in secret, as Vermeer wishes to avoid explanations. According to this version of events, the circumstances in which the portrait is commissioned and comes to be created are the cause of much trouble in the household and in Greet's personal life. I appreciated the observation of detail as seen through an artist’s eye, in this case, Greet's, as she took in the world around her with her wide eyes, from dusty streets along the canal to meat market stalls, and of course, Vermeer's works and studio."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A sharp, sensitive and absorbing novel of 17th century Netherlands, combining history art and fiction. The remarkable author Tracey Chevalier fleshes out and embellishes the story who the girl in the painting by Johannes Vermeer could be. Griet, a 16 year old Dutch girl in the town of Delft from a poor Protestant family is hired out as a housemaid to the wealthy Catholic painter. His household include Vermeer's vain and jealous wife, Katharina, Katharina's cordial and wise mother, Maria Thins, Tanneke, the Vermeers' other older household servant and the Vermeer children. Griet is wooed by Pieter, the handsome son of the local butcher, while Griet's parents worry she is losing her soul in the ostentatious Vermeer household. Griet's sister dies of the plague, and things grow more difficult for Griet, in her place of work, and in the circumstances of her family. which become more desperate. But the novel reaches its climax when Vermeer coerces Griet into being the model for one of his most ambitious works. Things spin out of control though for Griet there will be happy ending. Heartwarming, in parts amusing, a fable of self and disparate components, and hope and despair. A sterling piece of literature form a master novelist."

You know the Doctor Who episode with van Gogh? I always wondered what would've happened if Amy had stayed back with can Gogh. Intimacy can take different forms. Intimacy can mean different things. The difference of a few centuries definitely changes how intimacy is perceived. I have thought about how artists of the days of yore got their inspiration. I have also wondered about the kind of relationship they shared with their muses - with the men, and especially women who were made to sit or stand in the same position for days, months, years, so that the world's next great masterpiece could be produced. is a fictionalised report of an artist's relationship with his muse. Of all the Dutch artist's great paintings, the eponymous one is the best known, and in this book, Chevallier spins a wonderful, gripping story about the girl herself. Sixteen-year old Griet lives with her parents in Delft, in the vicinity of the now famous Johannes Vermeer. Her father, a tile painter, loses his eyesight, and by extension, his livelihood, following an accident at the kiln. Helpless, Griet has no choice but to work in the employment of Vermeer and his family - his wife Catherina, mother in law Maria Thins, and his vast brood of children, amongst whom is the psychopathic Cornelia. Thus begins a tale of longing and intimacy, the kinds of which we have read before, but remain to be fascinated by. For his own reasons, Vermeer chooses Griet. Perhaps it was the way she arranged vegetables for the soup when they just met, sorting them by colour; perhaps it was her big round eyes and her innocent beauty. Most likely, it was a combination of both; to say he wasn't drawn to her as she was to him would be a lie. In her, whether he saw a protege, a lover, a companion, an equal...or all of these, we will never know. That is a secret that died with him. What we do know is that she made him paint faster, and for now, that's all we need to know. is wonderfully poignant, beautifully tragic, and superbly sublime. The language complements the story, its simplicity and its depth. A story which taught me that intimacy is perhaps more than what we make it to be."

Luminously written. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but these thousand words paint a magnificent picture. I went to a book-signing in January 2001 and Chevalier said she wanted the reader to fly through the book with breathless anticipation. That's certainly how I read it the first time. But then I read it again - slowly - to savor each perfect word. I prefer the slow read, and I told Chevalier that. Our book club had a lot of discussion on whether the book should have / could have ended earlier ... when she is in the center of the square deciding in which direction to go. There is a scene in the book where Vermeer is trying to get Griet to ""see"" the colors in the clouds. At the end of that scene Griet says ""After that, I could not stop looking at things."" I felt the same way on reading . Just typing this review makes me look around and really observe the world around me. Quite simply a magnificent book."

Things started to pick up when she assisted Vermeer. The relationship between Griet and Vermeer was vague as he was such a mysterious man. 3.5 stars. Sad to say, I wasn't impressed.

My eyes just swim in it. Obviously, I am not alone. But while I am captivated by the woman’s eyes, the author, Tracey Chevalier, must have been consumed by them. Not surprisingly, the author writes her historical novel like she was there in 1664 Holland, and I can’t give her a better compliment than that. I am also partial to this novel because the author gives the painted woman life. We know Vermeer's painting and his brilliance, but we don't know anything about the subject he painted nor if he was a good or bad man himself. It’s an intriguing premise. In this novel, the woman is no longer merely an object of desire but a fleshed-out human being, flaws and all. It’s like watching an Instagram Influencer create a beautiful photograph of herself and share the moment on social media. What happens after she puts away the camera? Is she just as happy as she was in the photo? Does her smile fall flat? The same goes for this painting. Does the woman’s look of innocence change once the artist puts down his brush? Because of this novel, one of the most famous unnamed women in history now has a name, Griet, and better yet, a coming of age story. It begins when 16-year-old Griet has to leave her home when her father gets blinded in an accident and cannot work. Indebted, he pays his debt through his daughter, and she must live in Vermeer’s household as a maid. Vermeer’s sensuous talent naturally attracts the young Griet to his studio. While there, she develops a talent for mixing colour for Vermeer’s paints and soon gains a deeper appreciation of his art. Meanwhile, Vermeer is stuck in an artistic rut, and his household suffers. Art means food on the table, and even though they are aristocratic, they live beyond their means. But Vermeer is only inspired to paint when a licentious patron fixates on Griet, and Vermeer strikes a bargain with the man to paint her as a means to protect her. This temporary fix results in a cost to all. The wife’s cost is having Griet around her husband when she senses her husband wants something more. The cost to Vermeer is to paint for a man he abhors. The cost to Griet, who has no stature in this house, is far worse. Forced to navigate a world of jealousy, pettiness, and regret, she must walk a fine line between suffering and loneliness, contentment and belonging. The choice she makes affects them all. While the pearl earrings she wears in the painting plays a part, it is not what you think. Her eyes tell you more. Check it out."

I was really hoping I'd enjoy this book, but I did not think I was going to love it this much. Considering it's only a little over 200 pages, this book took me a lot longer than I thought to finish it - because I simply didn't want it to end. I read it painstakingly slowly to be able to absorb every word and every detail - and that's when you know I'm REALLY liking something. This book hooked me right from the very first few pages. This is a quiet story about a young woman named Griet who is hired as a maid for the famous 17th century painter Vermeer, and she is brought into his world - having to deal with his wife, his children, and his customers as she cleans his studio and tries to deal with her own hardships. When Vermeer decides to paint HER, her entire world flips on its head. Again, a VERY quiet story - if you want plot, then don't read this. This is definitely a character study and a character driven story, considering the plot of him painting her doesn't even happen until 75% of the way through the novel. But I ADORED this, I loved every character and I loved learning about each and every one of them - the obnoxious Catharina whose constantly pregnant, Tanneke the maid who seemed to have two sides to her, Cornelia the obnoxious little brat you just want to smack, Agnes the first character that makes you cry, Pieter who I can't decide my feelings about, and finally Griet who just wants to survive, love and be loved and Vermeer whose just as quiet and alluring as this book was. Now, I'm going to say something that will have anyone who knows me going 'WOAH WHAT' but... this book reminded me of Three Souls. I know, I know, I know - that is a BIG proclamation seeing that Three Souls is my favorite novel of all time. And no, this book isn't even close to touching Three Souls in my love, but it REMINDED me of it. It's just as quiet, and very much a woman's story about discovering yourself, discovering your sexuality and coming to terms with the fact that life isn't always perfect and doesn't always go the way you want it to. Not every story has a happy ending with a bow, sometimes life sucks but you have to make the best of it. Overall, I very obviously recommend this and I'm very happy I picked it up!"

I was torn between giving 4 (for a slight irritation with it) and 6 (for its brilliance). Fortunately, half way between the two is five. I loved it. Being someone who has dabbled in painting and constantly seeks to understand emotions, this book does well to provide a little insight into the process of painting and the complexities of life, especially the layering of paint and complexities with capturing light and colour of subjects. I often think writing is a very similar process, at least to myself – a word here, a paragraph there, a blotting in of items which help the senses come alive when reading a scene. The story itself is simple to read and only took me two nights to complete. I was engrossed with the writing, characters, setting and plot. Set in Holland 1660s we meet Griet, whose family is struggling to survive after her father, a tile painter, has an accident. She goes to work as a maid for the growing family of the artist Vermeer. Part of the irritation I had with the story revolves around the earring, and I don’t want to give away any of the plot to say what it was, and the other was I couldn’t help when I finished the story, of shouting out “WHY didn’t everyone just tell the wife the truth?” We have Griet falling in love with Vermeer, that is clear, and then him attracted to her, that becomes quiet clear, and during it all a wife constantly having children and seething with jealousy from the onset of the young maid coming into the family home. Part of the brilliance of this story was that I couldn’t stop thinking about all that is unsaid in this book, all that is implied, all that is imagined, and the complexities of relationships and what actually makes one unfaithful. I image readers will perceive so many different things with this book, as with layering different colours on a painting, life is full of emotional layers settling into our minds, emotions that change from day to day… some we never speak of, some are only meant for us to sort through, to find understanding, some are never thought of again. Bringing a painting to life, requires one to imagine, sort through all that we see, to find the very core of an object or thought. During and after reading this book I wondered the following: Is simply imaging being touched by a married man, unfaithful to his wife? Is a husband unfaithful to his wife when he has never said a word of encouragement to a young woman who day dreams about him, but does something he knows his wife will perceive as being unfaithful? How is it that a wife can sense the onset of what might become unfaithfulness, if only a mental unfaithfulness or what she believes is unfaithfulness? The answer to those questions aroused in myself I think are answered when we see what happens to those earrings at the end of the book. The complexities of bringing a painting to life, in particular the Girl with a Pearl Earring and the fictional account of how the painting could have possibly have happened, is mixed brilliantly with the complexities of love, jealousy, relationships, loss, social expectations, and different stations in life. Ultimately, Chevalier draws the reader into the world of the masterpiece in a manner that is moving, mysterious and often very poignant."

Set in the 1600's it's a subtle but multi-layered read - I just loved this story and can't describe why it's so moving. Sometimes it just is. I feel like I took all of Griet's emotions that she couldn't express and lived them for her. She evoked outrage, sadness, shame and a myriad of other feelings that flooded me and yet the story was so conventional that such extreme emotions should not exist...what a talent! My only reluctance in awarding 5 stars is not the skill of the writer(so good I will be reading more) but my own frustrations with Griet who should not have been so pliable and let everyone get away with treating her so badly ! The story would have been so different and probably completely out of character of the time if I'd got my way so it's a good job I'm not a writer! I so wanted Griet to kick-ass though...grrrr!"

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In 1664 16-year old Griet, a protestant, joins artist Johannes Vermeer’s household in the Papist Quarter of Delft, Holland, as a live-in maid. The few coins she earns per 6 day week is to feed her own family after her father was left blind in an industrial accident. The Vermeer’s and their soon to be 6 children live with the wife’s mother and her maid, in a chaotic household, where furnishings and food are much grander than at Griet’s own home, yet she quickly becomes aware of simmering tensions and that the family, though well-respected, is not as wealthy as it seems. Vermeer produces only 3 paintings a year and is dependent on his patron, the sleazy Van Ruijven, and commissions from businessmen around the town. Griet is given a bed in the cellar, her main tasks to handle the household laundry - fetching water from the canal to heat on a stove; cleaning (she is fastidious and careful around Vermeer’s studio in the attic), and running errands to the market where she catches the eye of the butcher’s son. When the 6th child is born and a nurse moves in to feed the baby the household is even more crowded and Vermeer suggests that a bed be made for Griet in the storeroom next to the attic studio. We follow Griet’s progress over three years through personal loss, as she graduates from a humble maid to assisting Vermeer in the preparation of pigments, and eventually, secretly posing for him in the famous painting, wearing his wife’s pearl earrings. The book is written in the first person from Griet’s point of view, as a semi-illiterate girl in a small town. I was drawn in by her descriptions of Delft, famous for its painted tiles; the pealing of the bells of the New Church visible from the window in the studio; the movement of goods by canal and hand cart, the windmills, the streets and houses and the star with the points in the market square. The reader is given descriptions of the clothing – Griet always wears a starched white cap to cover her hair – and the grandmother Maria Thins smokes a pipe. But it is in the detail of how Vermeer painted that really caught my attention. There is an unspoken chemistry between the artist and his subject, but Griet knows that once the painting is complete, accusations will fly and her days with the household will be over. The book ends ten years later in 1676. Griet has married the butcher's son and born him two sons. Both the odious Van Ruijven and Vermeer have passed away and Griet is called to the house where his widow and the younger of the surviving 11 children live in reduced circumstances. There is a brief mention of a war that led to the family’s decline (the Dutch-French war 1672-78 when King Louis XIV invaded the Netherlands) by the wife who carries her hatred of Griet. Not my usual reading fare, but a fascinating read for anyone interested in Art or History."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"So... this is a book I forgot I read before... Brain haze, and in my defence, it's been such a long time, but for years I've had it on my TBR thinking I hadn't read it (despite it actually being on my ""Read"" shelf on Goodreads...) because the movie left such a strong impression that the book somewhat fell in the shadows. So yeah, I've read it for a book club and realized mid-way through that it's a reread - because I remembered what had annoyed me the first time. Johannes Vermeer remains a mysterious figure in art history, with limited biographical information and a relatively small body of work (which, besides the famous ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""View of Delft"", I've never been much a fan of - I find his portraits disproportionate), but he's famous for his interior scenes and the way he plays with light. As such, it's not surprising that people have tried to reimagine his life and uncover the secrets behind his paintings. In this novel, Tracy Chevalier imagines the story behind the ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" painting, which is housed in the Mauritshuis in The Hague. Griet, a young servant in Vermeer's household, serves as the protagonist, and the narrative unfolds as she becomes not only Vermeer's assistant but also his model for the iconic painting. The conflicts that arise within Vermeer's family, particularly with his wife and daughter Cornelia, add layers of tension and drama to the story, exploring the complexities of relationships and societal norms in the context of the 17th-century Dutch setting. While some may interpret it as a love story, the emotional dynamics are more one-sided, with Griet harboring feelings and imaginations while Vermeer remains primarily focused on his art. Everything is mostly in Griet's head - she develops an obsession of sorts with the painter and imagines things that are not really there, while he is basically a selfish artist who lives almost exclusively for his art, to the detriment of everything around him - his excessively jealous wife, his children, his economic standing. The novel concentrates multiple themes in a very small bottle, without veering into irrelevant content. The combination of social commentary, introspection, and exploration of color and light theory enriches the novel, offering a multifaceted experience. For an art lover such as myself, this last aspect is what really drew me in. There are many romanticized biographies of painters, but most don't really focus on the painting part such as this one does. Chevalier really dives into the artistic and technical aspects of painting, particularly the detailed exploration of color mixing, application, and the practical facets of creating a painting. She focuses on color building and how what we see is in reality a mix of many different shades - a yellow cape is never just yellow, a blue fabric is never just blue, and the white of the pearl is, in reality, a mixture of various shades that are not white. Vermeer's predilection for camera obscura and light reflections is another area Chevalier concentrates on - the way he created translucent effects, the way light falls on different areas of people's faces and of the environment. It was interesting to me the painter's refusal to have his studio windows washed, because that would draw in too much light and interfere with his setup. The exploration of historical perspectives and social commentary in the novel adds depth and context to the narrative, and it's interesting to hear how Tracy Chevalier uses Griet's point of view to analyze the Delft society of the 1600s. The religious tensions between the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority, as seen through the lens of Vermeer's family and Griet's own preconceptions, provides insight into the cultural and religious dynamics of the time. Additionally, the examination of the societal position of women in different strata — from the empowered and influential women of means like Catherina Vermeer and Maria Thins to the struggles of women like Griet, who face limited choices and agency — highlights the stark social disparities. This dual exploration of religious and gender dynamics enriches the historical context of the novel, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and complexities faced by individuals in 17th-century Delft. Now to what irked me, both the first time, and at the reread: - Griet's treatment by basically everyone around her. The challenges she faces, not only from Catherina's jealousy but also from her own family (who has absolutely no problems to take all her hard-earned money and treat her like garbage in the process), highlight the harsh realities of her circumstances. Griet's journey towards self-assurance and growth becomes a central aspect of her character development, and I felt both a sense of empathy and frustration on her behalf as she navigates these difficult relationships. - Griet's own treatment of Pieter. She is dragging him along, while at the same time being in love (though I'd call it more an infatuation) with Vermeer. Pieter deserved better. - all the family drama around Griet, all the hiding and the lying. I honestly felt sorry for Catherina, she may not have been the best wife (though we only see her through Griet's eyes and don't know the full story), but the way everyone around her, including her mother, hides things from her made me cringe. So, I'll maintain my initial rating. It's an amazing historical fiction, one of the best societal portraitures I've read, and also probably the best fictionalized biographies of an artist I've stumbled upon. The fact that art is as its center and not forgotten behind the drama is a giant plus. But the small annoyances made me lose some of the enjoyment."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},I'm tempted to give this one 5 stars. Excellent historical fiction. Great characters surrounding an interesting story. Longer review to come. (I'm glad Cornelia got slapped again in the end. Perfect.)
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},I hated this book. It's nothing but a trashy romance novel dressed up as literature because it happens to be based on historical facts. A complete waste of time. I only added it to Goodreads so I would have a forum to express my hatred.
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Meh. I was bored during a large portion of this book. It really only got interesting the last 50 pages or so, and by then I had already checked out."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I suppose there are a couple of vantage points from which you can view this work of imagined history woven around the famous painting with the same title as the book. Given the fame surrounding the oil painting on canvas by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer in 1665, an obvious point of interest for a reader of this book could be on the relationship between the artist and his subject. Or, to learn about Vermeer’s life, of which there is very little documentation available to illuminate his thought process and the motivations behind his paintings. Or, to know more about the backstory of the young girl who modelled for Vermeer. Tracey Chevalier through a deft touch of audacious imagination lights up the life of the anonymous young woman in exotic dress and a very large pearl earring in a manner mirroring Vermeer’s emphasis on purity of light and form in his paintings. The mystery surrounding the identity of the actual model who sat for Vermeer and her enigmatic expression have drawn comparison with Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. However, as the helpful Encyclopedia Britannica informs us: . In many ways, what Tracey Chevalier does here is to rescue Vermeer’s most famous model from obscurity and recast her as the central character in an imagined historical narrative. Through the journey of Griet, a young Protestant girl and the protagonist, from her impoverished surroundings to the household of the Vermeers, we get to see some interesting vignettes of life in 17th century Delft – economic and social class differences, religious schisms, and gender relations. It is also a social commentary of an era marked by the duplicity of how women were perceived and treated - Griet carries the double burden of protecting her youth and vivacity from the lustful intent of the males around her while ensuring conformity to the societal norms of behavior expected of people like her. This story is also one of Griet’s coming of age – her transition from a girl to a woman – and of empowerment, her growing self confidence and her ability to understand and express artistic sensibilities related to shades of colors and the play of light and shadow. It is not an easy task to place the plot and momentum of a 240-odd page book on the frail shoulders of a marginal character in a historical setting dominated by well known artist and his famous creation. But Tracey Chevalier has woven a simple but beautiful tale that gives voice and agency to an otherwise anonymous ‘sitter’ for a tronie - a stock character in costume. And I know that next time I look at her image, I can surreptitiously comprehend what those wide-set eyes and parted lips convey."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Many times I have the habit of seeing an object and wondering what is its history, how it was created, what effect it had on the people around it. The writer seems to be doing this by creating a story inspired by the famous ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" painting. Of course the work she takes over is everything than easy, both because it is such a famous work, but also because it is a work that is known to create very intense feelings to the viewer. Of course the latter is what can offer many ideas as the girl with her body posture and her look shows a lot about her character and her emotional situation when she poses and I imagine this was something that would make it irresistible to the writer to write this novel. But who is that girl? What woman was she? Under what conditions did she pose for this painting? The author imagines she was a woman innocent and shy, feeling uncomfortable under the eyes of men, who hardly looked up but when she did it she could say a lot of things. A woman who guarded her modesty but her body was seeking a tender man's touch. A servant who perceived her social position but deeply desperately wanted something more. As for the story behind the painting, the author does not imagine a story of intense erotic passion, at least not the way we perceive it now. More is a story of erotic intimacy that is gradually acquired and exudes a restrained sensuality. This sensuality brings the author into the art of painting itself, giving it an interesting dimension. Apart from these, however, the author is describing us in a very nice way the life in the Netherlands of the time, showing us the social and religious barriers that separated people, as well as the position of women and what society expected from them in public and private space. This shows that the book is, among other things, a product of historical research. In the end I can say that the author made a very good choice by trying to create such a book, the result is really excellent. I loved it very much, both for its interesting story but also for the very nice way the author gives it, avoiding excesses and too much tensions, focusing on what is essential. This self-restraint that shows, without the writing at any point becoming subdued, is what made me appreciate even more what I read and I am glad that this element also dominates its amazing film adaptation, which is why I was involved with this book. Πολλές φορές έχω τη συνήθεια βλέποντας κάποιο αντικείμενο να αναρωτιέμαι ποια είναι η ιστορία του, πώς δημιουργήθηκε, τι επίδραση είχε στους ανθρώπους γύρω του. Κάτι τέτοιο φαίνεται να κάνει η συγγραφέας δημιουργώντας μία ιστορία εμπνεόμενη από τον διάσημο πίνακα ""Κορίτσι με το μαργαριταρένιο σκουλαρίκι"". Φυσικά το έργο που αναλαμβάνει κάθε άλλο παρά εύκολο είναι, τόσο γιατί πρόκειται για ένα τόσο διάσημο έργο, όσο γιατί είναι ένα έργο που είναι γνωστό ότι δημιουργεί πολύ έντονα συναισθήματα σε αυτόν που το βλέπει. Βέβαια το τελευταίο είναι αυτό που μπορεί να προσφέρει πολλές ιδέες καθώς το κορίτσι του πίνακα με τη στάση του σώματος και το βλέμμα του δείχνει πολλά για το χαρακτήρα του και τη συναισθηματική του κατάσταση όταν πόζαρε και φαντάζομαι αυτό είναι και κάτι που θα έκανε ακαταμάχητο τον πειρασμό στη συγγραφέα για να γράψει αυτό το μυθιστόρημα. Ποιο είναι, όμως, αυτό το κορίτσι; Τι άνθρωπος ήταν; Κάτω από ποιες συνθήκες κατέληξε να ποζάρει για αυτόν τον πίνακα; Η συγγραφέας φαντάζεται ότι ήταν μία γυναίκα αθώα και ντροπαλή, που αισθανόταν άβολα κάτω από τα βλέμματα των ανδρών, που δύσκολα σήκωνε το βλέμμα αλλά όταν το έκανε μπορούσε να πει πολλά πράγματα. Μία γυναίκα που φύλαγε τη σεμνότητά της αλλά το σώμα της αποζητούσε το χάδι. Μία υπηρέτρια που αντιλαμβάνονταν την κοινωνική της θέση αλλά κατά βάθος επιθυμούσε δειλά κάτι περισσότερο. Όσο για την ιστορία πίσω από τον πίνακα, η συγγραφέας δεν φαντάζεται μία ιστορία έντονου ερωτικού πάθους, τουλάχιστον όχι με τον τρόπο που το αντιλαμβανόμαστε τώρα. Περισσότερο πρόκειται για μία ιστορία ερωτικής οικειότητας που αποκτάται σταδιακά και αποπνέει έναν συγκρατημένο αισθησιασμό. Αυτόν τον αισθησιασμό η συγγραφέας τον μεταφέρει μέσα στην ίδια την τέχνη της ζωγραφικής, δίνοντάς της μία ενδιαφέρουσα διάσταση. Πέρα από αυτά, όμως, η συγγραφέας μας μεταφέρει με έναν πολύ ωραίο τρόπο τη ζωή στην Ολλανδία της εποχής, δείχνοντάς μας και τα κοινωνικά και θρησκευτικά φράγματα που χώριζαν τους ανθρώπους, όσο και τη θέση των γυναικών και το τι περίμενε η κοινωνία από αυτές στο δημόσιο και τον ιδιωτικό χώρο. Αυτό δείχνει ότι το βιβλίο είναι εκτός των άλλων και προϊόν ιστορικής έρευνας. Στο τέλος μπορώ να πω ότι η συγγραφέας έκανε μία πολύ καλή επιλογή προσπαθώντας να δημιουργήσει ένα τέτοιο βιβλίο, το αποτέλεσμα είναι πραγματικά εξαιρετικό. Μου άρεσε πάρα πολύ, τόσο για την ενδιαφέρουσα ιστορία του, όσο και για τον πολύ ωραίο τρόπο που μας τη δίνει η συγγραφέας, αποφεύγοντας τις υπερβολές και τις πολλές εντάσεις, εστιάζοντας σε αυτά που είναι ουσιαστικά. Αυτή η αυτοσυγκράτηση που δείχνει, χωρίς σε κανένα σημείο το γράψιμο να γίνεται υποτονικό, είναι αυτό που με έκανε να εκτιμήσω ακόμα περισσότερο αυτό που διάβασα και χαίρομαι που αυτό το στοιχείο κυριαρχεί και στην καταπληκτική κινηματογραφική του μεταφορά, η οποία είναι και ο λόγος που ασχολήθηκα με αυτό εδώ το βιβλίο."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Johannes Vermeer is one of my favorite painters. He painted genre scenes which are scenes of everyday life. Have you ever seen his painting, Woman Holding a Balance? It is gorgeous. Just look at what he does with the light. I also like Girl With a Pearl Earring because it is so mysterious. There were a lot of things I liked about this book, but I was honestly a little disappointed. Catarina, Vermeer's wife, is jealous, controlling, and possessive, and she is constantly pregnant. Catarina was probably Vermeer's model for some of his paintings (no one knows for sure), but it's not like that in this book. Instead, the author decides to write that Vermeer refuses to use his wife as a model because he claims she doesn't understand, and that she is probably too clumsy t0 stand still. Vermeer hires his rich patron and some other women as his models. The story begins with Griet, a shy and timid girl who is hired to be a maid for Vermeer's family. Some things in the novel are very unlikely to have taken place. Tanneke is Vermeer's older servant who grows increasingly hostile towards Griet for unclear reasons. The artist's wife is increasingly jealous, and one child is named Cornelia, one of Vermeer's many children. Whenever Griet goes to the butcher, she sees Pieter, who has romantic feelings for her. Meanwhile, in Vermeer's household, she starts helping him in his studio, helping him grind paint, and of course, looking through the camera obscura. No one else is allowed in the studio, but he certainly lets Griet in. This clearly needs to be kept secret, but it isn't that easy. Maria Thins, Vermeer's mother in law, is a scheming old woman who seems to side with Griet all the time. And when he finally paints Girl With a Pearl Earring (Griet being his model, of course), it causes a great stir among the family. She was wearing Catarina's pearl earrings. His wife is enraged and nearly stabs the painting, then Griet leaves the house and all of a sudden the novel fast forwards ten years later where she is married to Pieter and has children. It was slightly disappointing, because Vermeer seemed very superficial. I never understood why Catarina and Tanneke were so jealous of Griet. Also, the ending is quite abrupt. On the back of the book, it says that the story is as elegant as the time it is describing. I agree with that, because I find the Dutch Golden Age to be very elegant. It was fun reading about the Dutch and how they lived, because Chevalier does a good job with research of the times, and I am fond of the Dutch Masters of painting. There are other really beautiful Vermeer paintings. The Astronomer (1668) Woman With a Pearl Necklace (1662-1664) Girl Interrupted at Her Music (1660-1661) The Music Lesson (1662-1665) Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window (1657-1659)"
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“I heard voices outside our front door - a woman's, bright as polished brass, and a man's, low and dark like the wood of the table I was working on. They were the kind of voices we heard rarely in our house. I could hear rich carpets in their voices, books and pearls and fur.” This book is about Griet, who, at the age of sixteen, becomes a maid at the Vermeers' to provide financial support to her family after her father has an accident at his workplace and is no longer able to work and support his family. Mr. Vermeer is an artist and doesn't like his studio to be messed with. One of Griet's jobs is to clean his studio and meticulously place the things back where they were initially. Soon Griet starts helping Vermeer in making paints and modelling for his painting which strains his relationship with his wife. This book is based on the theme of envy. As Griet works at the Vermeers', she starts to envy the wealth and social status that allows them to own luxurious goods and throw elaborate parties. she also envies Catharina, Mrs. Vermeer, for the romantic relationship she shares with Vermeer. Catharina, on the other hand, is envious of the fact that she is not allowed inside the studio due to her clumsiness and Griet is modelling for the her husband's painting. Irony is also used at many instances. Griet was employed because she could work without moving or disrupting anything in the studio but towards the end we see that she is the cause of a lot of chaos in the lives of Vermeers, traces of which linger even after her departure. Another example of irony is that Catharina becomes pregnant at frequent intervals in the novel, she does so in order to strengthen her bond with Vermeer. Her many children give her a sense of security and privilege. Ironically, however, the frequent pregnancies actually create distance between Vermeer and Catharina as she is often preoccupied with her condition, and the more children he is responsible for providing for, the more pressure is placed on him. The only thing which bothered me in this book was the character of Cornelia, daughter of Catharina. She is a well-written, vile character who you absolutely loathe. And she is meant to be hated. But in the majority of the novel, she is six to eight years old. It was difficult for me to digest the fact that an eight year old could be this vile and cause so much havoc in her family. Overall, it was a great read! 4 stars."

This was mainly because I appreciated the cleverness of Tracy Chevalier's writing so much more this time. Set in the 17th Century, the book imagines the story behind the girl featured in Vermeer's famous painting and how she came to be his subject and muse. We follow young Griet who begins working in Vermeer's household as a servant and develops a connection with him through her natural intuition for art and how she sees the world through an artist's eyes. However, for Griet, there are constant reminders of her vulnerability when it comes to lack of control and potential for exploitation as a servant girl. The atmosphere in this book is so rich and layered with a tension that slowly builds over the course of the story, leaving you on tenterhooks waiting to see what will happen to Griet and what will be her inevitable downfall. So much of the power of this story lies in what goes unsaid, both in terms of dialogue between the characters and what we as readers are shown or just given hints about. It is the brilliant writing that really brings this story to life and makes it a book you want to reread."

The descriptions of the painting process, and how Vermeer sees the world, are really eye-opening and beautiful. I never really liked the character of Vermeer, but I'm not sure you're really supposed to. Look up some of Vermeer's paintings, then read this book for the (fake but still interesting) story behind them. After reading this, I went and picked up because I wanted to read more of Chevalier's work. Long story short: is kind of a disappointment, and unless you absolutely loved , I advise you not to bother."

I was also very close to meeting the author Tracy Chevalier at a local literature festival close to where I live here in England but sadly missed her by a couple of hours. I've always been fascinated by the portrait of the Girl With A Pearl Earring and to hear that a novel of the same portrait name was published, I leapt at the chance to read it. The story is told through the eyes of Griet who becomes a maid to a famous painter, Johannes Vermeer. The writing has everything: scandal, excitement, romance, the importance of staying true to yourself. I thought that the scenes describing how Griet and Johannes was an interesting look into art in the 1600s. This was a nice, easy read and was left satisfied with the ending. Couldn't fault it. Would recommend to others. BIG NEWS: I had no idea there was a film of this too! Until my mum came in and asked me what I was reading, I can't contain my excitement! :)"

I didn't learn a lot about Vermeer. I also didn't like his wife, Katarina, or the patron, VanRuyvn. Katarina seemed too rude and self-centered for me. VanRuyvn was too forward by constabnyl showing his interest in the narrator, Griet, despite the fact that he was married and old enough to be her father or grandfather. I thought that the person reading the book, (we listened to the audio editor), was decent. I don't plan to read any other books by this author despite the fact I shelved them. Hopefully, the movie will be better if we ever watch it. As a side note, I felt that the author semed to focus a little too much on Katarina's pregnancies. I would also recommend reading biographies of artists if you are someone who is more interested in their actual lives than reading a fictionalized version that might only have a few facts throughout it."

There’s a lot of drama and Griet finds herself growing apart from her family and becoming a different person. ____________________________________________ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ➸ is described as intelligent, beautiful and modest. She’s not the most reliable narrator as she is still in the process of maturing. Griet is uneducated but shows her knowledge of art from the very beginning, without her even realizing. She quickly becomes fascinated by Vermeer and their relationship is the main conflict of the book. The way she always refers to him by pronouns suggests that Vermeer is the only man in the world to her. ➸ is a painter. He is a complete enigma and stays like that throughout the whole book. I still have no ideia who he was, what he thought and how he felt towards Griet. I think he is one of the most selfish and self centered characters I’ve ever known. He clearly has no respect for his wife since he completely disregards her feelings. He doesn’t really see Griet as a person but rather her potential as a painting. The only thing he cares about is art. ____________________________________________ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ➸ The ending was realistic and it felt like she was finally moving on and letting go of her past. I don’t think she should’ve ended up with any of the two men because neither were right for her. Ultimately, her decision symbolizes the renunciation of art and a world full of beauty in exchange for financial security. I felt extremely sorry for her. ____________________________________________ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ੈ✩‧₊˚ ➸ There are so many things going on in this book. The main theme is clearly . It’s what draws Griet and Vermeer closer. By showing Griet’s artistic spirit, the book suggests that art can be found within everyone no matter their class or gender. ➸ The of the characters is extremely relevant. Griet comes from a working class family and that’s the only reason why she went to the Vermeer household in the first place. It also makes her more likely to accept Pieter’s offer. Griet is intelligent but her class position defines how people perceive her. Because she is a maid, the other characters strongly believe that her only purpose in life is to serve and please them. ➸ What moves the characters is . As Griet becomes familiar with the Vermeer household, she starts to envy their lifestyle. She also envies Vermeer for being able to dedicate his life to art, and Catharina for her romantic relationship with him. It makes sense for Griet, who is a maid, to be jealous of her masters. But then, the book shows that everyone can experience jealousy. Van Ruijven is jealous of Vermeer’s proximity to Griet, just like Pieter. Catharina, despite her status and being Vermeer’s wife, envies Griet’s access to the art studio and intimate relationship with the painter. By showing that envy can be experienced no matter how wealthy one person is, the book suggests that power and money don’t guarantee happiness. ➸ I hope I get to see the painting in real life someday. If I hadn’t read this book I wouldn’t pay as much attention to it. If I ever get to see it, I’m definitely going to be thinking about Griet."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"When Griet's father has a crippling accident that prevents him from working, her parents hire her out as a maid to the famous Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. From her position as maid she sees, and contributes to, the domestic tensions of the household as she tries to skirt the fragile temper of Vermeer's wife, who becomes more jealous as Griet is given more tasks in her husband's painting studio. Griet becomes closer to the striking painter as time goes by. She goes from just cleaning the studio to assisting him in preparing his paints, and eventually sits to be painted, becoming the subject of one of his most famous paintings, The Girl With the Pearl Earring. Wow, that synopsis sounds pretty good, doesn't it? It almost makes you want to go down to the library and pick it up. Well, don't waste your time. Girl With a Pearl Earring was disappointing in every category. Though it was a light and easy read that I finished in about a day, I still felt like I wasted my time reading this book. First of all, let's start with the main character, Griet. I'm not even sure if I should call her a main character really, because she has almost no personality except for a few trite and overdone traits that are supposed to make her seem strong or moral, but just make her come off as a stuck up brat. She makes a big deal of not letting anybody see her hair, saying that she's not the kind of girl who ""lets her hair down,"" meaning that she isn't a prostitute. She then goes on to mention that the style of the time was to have the hair only partially covered or put up in a bun. So does she really need to make such a big deal (and she does make a really big deal) out of keeping her hair tucked away so safely? No, she doesn't, and by doing so she shows herself to be a pretentious goody two-shoes who thinks that she's more pure or whatever than everybody else. If this is the author trying to give Griet a will of her own, it's a very poor way of doing it. Her hair and her strange obsession with her employer (who never gets a personality besides liking peace and quiet and having gray eyes), are her only defining characteristics, and that makes it really hard to empathize with her in any way. The overly dry and observational writing style doesn't help much either. Now go and apply that to every single character, good guy and bad guy alike, and you'll begin to see why I consider this book so over-rated. So the characters aren't very good. Maybe it's a plot-driven book? Sadly, no. If there is a plot in this book, it would probably be the build up to Griet being painted. Or maybe it's the relationship between Vermeer and Griet. Or maybe it's the relationship between Griet and the butcher's son. Well, the answer is that it's all of those and none of them at the same time. Chevalier has enough material for there to be a really deep and interesting plot, but she never fully develops any of them, so it just ends up being a meaningless, directionless story told from the perspective of a disinterested narrator. Even the point that should be the climax of the story, when Vermeer finally paints Griet, seems somehow lifeless and meaningless. Ok, so it's not plot driven or character driven, but maybe it has a great setting? It is historical fiction after all. The answer is yet again no. The setting should, in my opinion, be the highlight of historical fiction, and yet I had to go back and look at a summary of the book to tell you where and in what time it took place (seventeenth century Netherlands). That is never a good sign. Griet describes her surroundings a couple of times, mostly a bridge over a canal and a big church, but other than that this could have been set in almost any time or place. While the characters make a big deal out of women not having children out of wedlock and of maids being respectful to their employers, I feel like those are things that are true of most times, and don't really serve to give a good sense of place. In fact, for a book about a painter, most of the descriptions were very bland. She spends time grinding colors for Vermeer, but while she says that they are beautiful, I was never once captivated by a single description of either a color or a painting. Now, while the plot, characters, and descriptions may have been bad, there have been many books that were saved by a good message and a good ending. Sadly, this book is not one of them. I'm not really even sure what the point of the book was supposed to be. The ending was very rushed, and though I could tell that the author was trying to be profound, the whole thing just came off as trite and meaningless. I love cheesy books as much as anyone, but this one wasn't even cheesy. It was just awkward, because I could tell that the author wanted to be meaningful, but just couldn't figure out how to do it. I love art, and realism like Vermeer's is one of my favorite styles of painting. This novel had so much potential to be decadently descriptive and rivetingly beautiful, but none of that potential was ever realized. This book was simply one big disappointment. I was planning to read another of Chevalier's books, Remarkable Creatures, but after reading this I don't know if I really want to read anything else by this author. What a shame.

A pleasant surprise! I watched the movie adaptation of this book many years ago. I liked the movie, so I thought I could skip the book. However, I realized that I've never read a book set in the Netherlands. Most of the Dutch characters I have come across in my readings are in the setting of colonial Dutch East Indies (nowadays Indonesia). Because this story is set in 1664-1676 Netherlands, I decided to read it. So glad I did! If you love art, I definitely recommend that you pick this book up. The story centers around the 16-year-old girl Griet, who has to work as a servant for the Vermeer family since her father became blind and lost his trade. Does the name Vermeer ring a bell?? Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) was a Dutch painter who mostly painted indoor and domestic scenes. The book cover is one of his most famous paintings ""A Girl with a Pearl Earring."" The author Tracy Chevalier wanted to write a historical fiction about the girl in that painting. Chevalier magnificently captured the setting of 17th century Delft and the tension of working as a live-in house servant in a large family. Vermeer's wife Catherine despised Griet, simply because she thought that all maids are thieves and will try to have an affair with the man of the house. Vermeers' house had a lot of occupants (father, mother, maternal grandmother, over 6-11 children, grandmother's loyal servant). As the least-powerful person in the house, Griet was subject to a lot of extra labor, grumpiness/moodiness and some naughty tricks by one of the children. I also enjoyed the fuss the protagonist made about Catholics vs. Protestants. How times have changed! : the book is better than the movie. The book successfully conveyed the tensions present between man and woman, employer and employee, painter and subject painted. These things are very difficult to present in a movie."

Today, standing beside the life-like famous portrait of Vermeer created a surreal once in a lifetime kind of experience. The penetrating eyes of the girl with no name follow you wherever you stand just like Mona Lisa. The turban is so incongruous there, a European girl with an out-of-place oriental piece of fabric and pearl earrings in no way Vermeer could have afforded. Still, it’s striking, it’s mysterious and the identity of the girl is still debated while the portrait continues to be one of the most popular paintings ever existed. Two years ago, I read Girl with the Pearl Earring written by one of my favourite historical fiction authors Tracy Chevalier and absolutely fell in love with it. The story recounts the life of Vermeer as he was struggling to paint the portrait. Chevalier gave it a stunning twist based on facts about Vermeer’s life based on a turbulent domestic affair that created the famous painting. A must read for all historical fiction and arts lovers."

I'm casting my vote on the excellent side. Chevalier took one of Vermeer's best-known and most enigmatic paintings and built a story around it (there are a series of these novels; Joyce Carol Oates' I Lock My Door Upon Myself is the only other one I've read, and it is similarly excellent). Griet, a sixteen-year-old from the Protestant side of the tracks, becomes the maidservant of the Vermeers after a kiln accident forces her father out of a job, and the story alternately skips between the variouis tensions within the Vermeer household and Griet's courting by a somewhat ham-handed, if well-meaning, butcher. It's subject matter that could have (and has) been screwed up in too many ways to imagine, but Chevalier pulls it off by keeping the prose spare and letting the silences speak most of the necessary lines. ****"

The problem is that Chevalier literally re-creates every element in the painting. Why she wore this, why she wore that, where everything she wore came from, why she turned that way instead of the other way, etc., etc., etc. It's an artistic play-by-play, but devoid of texture. It is fiction in that the explanations for every muscle twitch are imagined, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. I found myself wishing the author would have taken just a bit of artistic license."

Tracy Chevalier does a wonderful job in creating a story around this painting and in re-creating the atmosphere of a wonderfully-imagined 17th century. It's like the painting comes to life in Chevalier's story and this seems so natural that you become fully convinced by the end of the book that things really happened the way Chevalier described in her story, although this is a work of fiction.

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A simple teenaged girl from a poor family is forced into service in a more prosperous 17th-Century Delft household. Other than the Dutch setting, this could be the start of a Dickensian tale of working-class woe or yet another BBC soap opera about the downstairs help. But instead of a grasping capitalist, historical fiction writer Tracy Chevalier made the master of the house one Johannes Vermeer, one of the greatest Dutch Golden Age artists. This leads the story in a very different -- and welcome -- direction. Our heroine Griet is sixteen when (the way she refers to Vermeer throughout) and his perpetually pregnant wife Catharina appear in her family's kitchen and grudgingly hire her to be a maid. From that early point, we know exactly what's going to happen -- somewhere down the road, Griet will become the eponymous one of Vermeer's most famous works. The story is the of this improbable outcome. Chevalier tells the story through Griet's eyes and words. It's a potentially risky choice: how do you put yourself in the head of a 17th-Century teenager? The reviews show that her solution is a love-it-or-hate-it proposition. Other reviewers have called Griet stupid and naïve and have complained about the simple language and straightforwardness of her narration. I, for one, found these things entirely in character. Few adults in the 17th Century were as worldly as the typical American teenager is today; girls in particular were sheltered from the world, barely educated, and went directly from their fathers' arms to their husbands' with no chance to be their own selves. It's unlikely that a girl like Griet would ever leave Delft, a small, provincial town in a small nation. I could persuade myself that the narrator was a bright, observant, but unschooled and sheltered small-town girl suddenly thrust into a strange and vaguely threatening environment and told to sink or swim. We come to see the settings through an accretion of detail rather than (the historical's common vice) huge stretches of description. Also in character, Griet describes the things that are new or strange to her; we know more about Vermeer's house than we do her own, for instance. She reports on clothes, hair and jewelry as we might expect, and as someone who's gone hungry for a while, she shows a great interest in food. And -- as we might also expect -- she nourishes a crush on the dashing, creative, kind, and somewhat mysterious Vermeer. Other reviewers complain that the artist is as much an enigma at the end of the book as at the start. This makes sense, though; a servant in his house would never be allowed to learn about his thoughts or feelings, his business dealings, or his wants or needs (except in connection to food or clean clothes). It's only because Griet has an eye for color and composition that he pays as much attention to her as he does, and that he slowly draws her into his work. Unfortunately, Chevalier allows many of the supporting characters to be and stay types: Catharina is a spendthrift, over-fertile bitch; Vermeer's principal patron van Ruijven is a lecher and sot; Vermeer's daughter Cornelia is a vicious schemer; and so on. Very few of the characters get anything like an arc. I can't tell if this is because the author felt handcuffed inside Griet's head and couldn't get the scullery maid to notice subtle changes in these characters, or she was simply too focused on Griet's journey down the road set out for her on page 1. Whatever it is, it knocked a full star off the rating. could probably be accused of being a literary historical novel: there are no big stakes, nothing huge happens, and we stay firmly embedded in the narrator's head. At the same time, it's a very easy read -- I finished it in a single afternoon and didn't feel like opening a vein. A teen reader tired of high-school might enjoy spending a few hours watching the life of her counterpart from 350 years ago. It may also help to be interested in art or to have a pre-existing connection with Vermeer. It's easy to see why this book made the author famous; if you haven't run across Chevalier before, this is an easy way to get to make her acquaintance."

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I had to persevere in order to make it through Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring. In spite of all the reviews on the back cover lauding this as a literary gem, a literary jewel, and a dazzling novel, I was pretty sure it was ""just"" a romance novel. My romance credentials are these: although I have never read a romance novel, I have seen the covers of romance novels. And I've also listened to people I know discuss romance novels. So with that it mind... It struck me as cheesy in a Fabio romance novel sort of way for Griet, our narrator, to walk about emphasizing how private she is. She wears a cap, which she starches with potato peels, to hide her face from others. She explains to us how she presses her lips into a line to subtly express her disapproval. We learn that she does this to repress the wanton woman within her, which is revealed by her hair -- it cannot be tamed. It can only be covered with a cap. I suppose authors have to toss in characterization somehow, but it all struck me as a bit vain. Perhaps it's just that Griet has an eye for detail, which will unfortunately be squandered on separating vegetables by color. That is, until she is hired as a maid to clean and do laundry for the famous 17th century Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer. Vermeer is attracted to Griet, which we can tell by the way he teases her by mixing her vegetables, by the way he doesn't talk to her, and by how Griet can feel him staring down at her from his second story studio window*. Sadly, he's married. And Griet admits that he obviously loves his wife, even though she's not as aesthetically perfect as Griet. Catharina can't even sit still long enough to be painted. She's not transcendent enough for art, nor for a tragic romance. Although we're told this tale from Griet's point of view, I found it difficult not to see her as the intruder. She is introducing betrayal into this family, and it's odd that it is so natural to hate one of Vermeer's daughters, who I think we could argue is only trying to get Griet fired to save her parents' relationship. We're also invited to sympathize with Vermeer, perhaps because Chevalier felt that it would be wrong to write a historical figure as an adulterer without any evidence that he cheated on his wife. He seems quite loyal to his family, but his first concern appears to be his art. This is one reason why the Vermeer family struggles to make ends meet. Another may be that our painter's wife, Catharina, is always pregnant -- ""Again?"" says Griet at one point. (Interestingly, Chevalier was pregnant while she wrote this novel.) Moments like these help us to notice that Griet has painted Catharina as a bit of an imbecile, unworthy of her brilliant husband. Isn't this a jealous teen's narrative? What intrigued me is that Chevalier, who we might expect to have identified with Catharina, nevertheless wrote in such a way that we can identify with Griet, and even walk away from this novel quite sympathetic to her and Vermeer. Chevalier's ending even allows us to walk away without sympathy for Catharina or the other members of her family. Bizarre! So is it a gem? Is it literary? I really have not read enough ""romance"" to speculate over what distinguishes it from literature. Having said that, I couldn't escape the feeling that making Johannes Vermeer a primary character in this novel tricked critics into associating with high art. But I'm quite prepared to accept rebuttal. And regardless of the reviews, Chevalier does offer readers a pretty tangled web. *Might be the next step for fans looking for a more mature depiction of the Edward/ Bella dynamic?"

Probably would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't been forced to read the whole book out loud as a class - some of the scenes were not the kind to be read out loud with idiotic teenage boys jeering at the sex scenes (well, I thought they were sex scenes when I was 17). Despite that horribly embarrassing experience I enjoyed the story and should probably read it again now that it's 10 years down the track. 3/4/16 - It's been another four years since I wrote that and I'm finally rereading it. Reading books like this one, with young women in vulnerable working positions because of their lower class status always make me twitchy. I have a high sense of justice and fairness and when there is a situation where someone isn't treated with the fairness that I believe they deserve, in life or fiction, I get kind of ragey. Anyone who disturbs me better watch out for my wrath, because if I can't scream at the characters I'm likely to take my frustration out on you. In this book I get angry with pretty much everyone - Vermeer for just assuming that it's okay for Griet to work for him and not caring how it affects her life within the household, Catharina for taking her fears regarding her own insecurities out on Griet, Tanneke for believing that Griet was purposefully attracting all the attention Vermeer was paying her, Maria Thins for having the power to make things easier for Griet but not bothering to, and Cornelia for being a hateful and jealous little girl (see even children can't escape my anger). To be continued... 4/4 - I think this will have to stay at three stars. It's an interesting story and a creative idea for a backstory to Vermeer's most well-known, and supposedly most impressive, painting, but for me the book was just 'above average' (hence the three stars) in regards to my enjoyment levels. After finishing it last night I spent quite a while on Wikipedia looking at Vermeer's body of work and have come to the conclusion that I'm not that much of a fan. The painting that the book's title takes its name from is the only one I can honestly say I actually (the colours of the turban are very vibrant and eye-catching), for the rest of the paintings I find the subject matter (mostly domestic life portraits with a couple of religious scenes) dull and not something I would want to have hanging on my wall. I don't think I'll keep this in my library as I'm pretty sure I won't read it again."

She respected all that is known of the man and the time, and yet brought to life in a vivid and completely believable way, people that lived so long ago. I won't delve into the story - after all these years and the movie of the same tittle, it is by now very well known. Suffice to say this is a deceptively simple story filled with light and color, that you will read all at once because it really can't be put down, and once you are finished....you will start it over again...somewhat more slowly this time, so you can fully enjoy this truly beautiful book. Side Note : This is naturally far more ""complete"" than the movie that shares its title - and yet both seem to complement each rather well. Tracy Chevalier sold the rights and was not involved in adapting it, but is said to have been pleased with the final result. Take some time and watch the movie... It is a visual feast for anyone remotely interested in Art...and Vermeer. Happy Readings! (small edits done because I read it and found some typos!)"

I love the idea of an in depth look inside a person's life and thoughts. Of all the novels I've read that can fit into this category, however loosely, the one that has beguiled me the most was Girl with a Pearl Earring. Tracy Chavalier writes with such ease of knowledge that almost any sentence she begins is bound to end with me falling just that little bit more in love. Her 1999 best seller, Girl with a Pearl Earring (for those of you unlucky enough to have not read it yet) is set during the 1600's in Delft and follows the story of a young girl named Griet who becomes a maid for the renowned artist, Vermeer and his family. Griet is a quiet and introspective character whose simple thoughts and moral beliefs are the back bone of this novel. Her introduction to the world of paint and colour is in itself the most rewarding aspect of the book. Seeing her see the world through different eyes is simply breathtaking.

I confess when it comes to this sort of genre, my expectation is stuffy and lengthy prose heavily laden with historical 'facts' and whatnot. Girl with a Pearl Earring isn't any of those things. The overall length is somewhat short, the prose is surprisingly tight, almost harsh in its abrupt action. The novel does contain plenty of setting establishing factors, but it never feels too much like the author is just trying to convince us they've done their research. My only problem with the story was it felt a little too much like all the excitement and tension just happened to and resolved around the main character like a storm. While narrator Greit, is a resourceful and at times sassy lady I felt like it would have been a slighter more powerful story if she actually more active within it. Admittedly the idea of the story is to show Greit growing up, which often does happen through events that happen to us rather than our own proactive moves."
Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},This is the story of Griet - a maid in 1600's Delft Holland and the imagined subject of Vermeer's famous painting. I really enjoyed this book. I love thinking that Chevalier was looking at this painting and thought - What is this story? Who is this girl? The stunted writer in me thinks this would be a really fun writing exercise. I really have to give Chevalier credit. This book was easy to read and very engaging. I am a fan. On a side note - the movie made from this (with Scarlett Johansonn and Colin Firth) is very good as well. The photography is amazing - and it is one of the rare films that I feel did a pretty good job of retaining the essence of the book.

Sensitive and colourful, I had no problem imagining the ebb and flow of the Vermeer household. The hardest part was to really understand the significance of each look and movement the narrator received from the men around her and especially the artist himself, and how it impacted her psyche and following actions. I guess those days and being devout Protestant and a woman put you into extreme odds, so different from our days."

Girl with a Pearl Earring,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2865.Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"‘I had not thought I would learn something from a maid,’ „Girl with a pearl earring” written by Tracy Chevalier is a novel set in 17th century Delft- Holland. It’s inspired by Johannes Vermeers’ acclaimed painting of the same name. The book focuses on 16 year old Griet who becomes a maid in the house of Vermeer. The story seems simple, doesn’t it? The simplicity and dare say lethargy of the action makes it very dull at first- which I think was Chevalier’s intention. This book isn’t an action packed adventure story, Griet isn’t an extraordinary person who has magical experiences while starting a new chapter of her life. No, she is just a normal person, who is abruptly put in a new situation and has to deal with it. This novel is about the depth of her mind, it focuses on her as a person and the way she reacts to things around her rather than focusing on the action itself. We experience the whole book through her wide eyes. One of my favorite aspects of Griet’s complex personality was for sure her hair and how she perceives it. When her master sees her without her head cap she feels like someone has taken everything valuable about her away from her- without her consent. Later she forgets her values and makes hasty decisions. As Griet states, her hair, hidden under the cap symbolizes her wilder, sensual side, which she prefers to hide. Vermeer seeing it without her consent could be seen as something of rape, through griet’s eyes. She lost the one thing which she had for herself, now she could do anything. N o t h i n g mattered. Talking about Vermeer, I need to address his distinction from all the other characters. The mysterious figure of the artist, commonly referred to as „him”, is interesting and full of secrets. As we meet all the other characters, as we start to feel Griet’s anxiety, Catharina’s jealousy and Cornelia’s resentment, we still don’t know Vermeer. No one knows him. The reader could compare him to his own work. He is, like his painting, enigmatic and sometimes even frightening. Due to little to no information about Vermeers real life, Chevalier created someone taciturn and furtive, I dare say, someone sad. The only moment we see him opening up is when he talks about art. The whole process of creating paint and painting itself is thoroughly explained. I am specifically fond of this extract: ‘what color are the clouds?’ ‘Why? White, sir.’ He raised his eyebrows slightly. ‘Are they?’ I glanced at them. ‘And gray. Perhaps it will snow.’ ‘Come, Griet, you can do better than that. Think of your vegetables’ ‘My vegetables, sir?’ He moved his head slightly. I was annoying him again. My jaw tightened. ‘Think of how you separated the whites. Your turnips and your onion- are they the same white?’ Suddenly I understood. ‘No. The turnip has green in it, the onion yellow.’ ‘Exactly. Now, what colors do you see in the clouds?’ ‘There is some blue in them,’ I said after studying them for a few minutes. ‘And- yellow as well. And there is some green!’ I became so excited I actually pointed. I had been looking at clouds all my life, but I felt as if I saw them for the first time at that moment. Tracy Chevalier shows the passionate nature of artists. As someone fond of art, I was especially touched by this part. Realizing how close art really is, that practically everything is art, made me gasp out loud. I also want to acknowledge that the book is written in a very poetic way. The author excelled at using this 17th century type of language which made me- as a reader- feel engaged. The ending of the book may seem random or hasty even, but I think it’s sort of poetic. Grieg finally pays the debt and “comes free”, she isn’t the property of anyone- not the Vermeers, nor her parents nor Pieter. But something that has occurred to me after finishing is that in reality she isn’t actually free, she still married the butcher’s son who, due the times they are living in, has full control over her and her children. But the ending still seems fulfilling, because the freedom of Griet is symbolized by the little things; her finally slapping Cornelia or her becoming the pearl earrings- her taking up control of her life for the first time. For the first time she isn’t just a maid, she isn’t a girl who can be treated like dirt- she is free. „Girl with a pearl earring” is a breath-taking piece of literature which I have been thinking about constantly since finishing. I am sure this wasn’t a one-time read and I will soon come back to it full of comfort and peaceful nature. This novel is a must-have for everyone interested in art- it’s a no doubt 5 star book. “’Try closing your eyes’ I closed them. After a moment I felt the window frame and the pitcher in my hands, anchoring me. Then I could sense the wall behind me, and the table to my left, and the cold air from the window. This must be how my father feels, I thought, with the space all around him, and his body knowing where it it.” “’Don’t worry father,’ I whispered to him while my mother was introducing Pieter to a neighbor, ‘ you aren’t losing me.’ ‘We’ve already lost you, Griet. We lost you the moment you became a maid.’ I was glad he could not see the tears that prickled my eyes” ‘It’s not the painting that is Catholic or Protestant,’ he said, ‘ but the people who look at it, and what they expect to see. A painting in a church is like a candle in a dark room- we use it to see better. It is the bridge between ourselves and God. But it is not a Protestant candle or a Catholic candle. It is simply a candle.’ “A made came free”"

The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In my youth I felt saturated with Van Gogh’s art. Its popularity made it predictable. As one of the greatest victims of the phenomenon that explores in his , one could expect to see posters of Van Gogh’s , or his , or , in a third of the rooms of students. I suspected that more than this bright colours, always welcome in dingy lodgings, it was the legend grown out of the morbid aspect of his supposed suicide that explained the ubiquity of his art. As a museumgoer, I have seen many of his paintings in various galleries and cities. I also visited long ago his museum in Amsterdam. But it was more recently, in an exhibition with a room devoted to him, when I felt completely enraptured in wonder in front of a couple of his paintings. But I have wanted to read his letters for years and reading these has been a delight. Most of them are addressed to his brother Theo, but there are a few to painter friends, such as and . It was his sister in law who collected and edited them and gave them for publishing in 1913. They span from the Summer of 1872 until a couple of days before his death on 1890. Reading his Letters I feel that he could not have disapproved, since he himself was addicted to reading biographies of other painters, those he admired, hoping to find a guide to his own path as a painter. If not looking for the same guidance, I have approached them to help me get closer to his art. It has been a fascinating process to be able to follow how he gradually discovered his painting vocation, which happened relatively late. At first he felt his calling was for the church. Once he became disappointed with the clerical life, he thought of becoming a social helper. During this time, though, references to paintings and art, and close descriptions of landscapes, fill his letters. It was not until he was around 26 that he finally decided to become an artist. This was in 1879 and he had to begin his training, drawing and materials, from the start. What comes across clearly, whether he is discussing art or whatever else, is the profound intensity with which he approached anything he undertook and the passion with which he defended his ideas. One could say he was a Romantic, not in the historical sense, but in the theoretical one. He pursued with his art his religious longings. Aestheticism at its purest. During my read I felt compelled to post many updates. Most of these are either descriptions in text of what could have been visual. If even before he drew and painted he would send accounts of his visual impressions, once he began producing paintings, at a very fast rate, he would send textual versions of his painterly renditions. And in text colour dominates. His paintings are described as a succession of things in tones. The colour of the tree, the colour of his table, the colour of the grass, the colour of the sun, the colour of someone's coat… He does not discuss compositions or arrangements or drawing. His art discussions veer towards the most visual, colours. Why has he chosen which colour and what it signifies. We see then that even if he painted outdoors and very rarely from memory, he was not a naturalist. He developed his own system for colours based on correspondences with his own moods and very personal impressions. But this was not fixed. It could not be, It varied with his emotions. And this personal meaning to his painting is what explains that even if it was after his arrival in Paris in 1886, where he fell under the spell of Impressionism, when he changed his palette from the earth tones to the bright and primary colours, he pursued something very different from the French painters. He aim was not to record of the sensory. And that is also why he did not get close to the analytical art of the . Van Gogh had a profoundly and intensely intimate relation with painting, with the act of painting itself. His brushstroke is rich and thick and expressive. His canvases have a loaded texture. And this texture has his mark. With such a personal approach to his art we should not be surprised that his stated favourite genre was portraiture-- of others and of himself. . To follow this epistolary approach to his art is also suitable because Van Gogh was a very literary man. This literary outlook tinted his vision of his surroundings. A compulsive reader, he peppers his letters with references to a wide array of writers. Very knowledgeable of French literature, and even if he turned his back to the Naturalist painters, his preferences in literature were for the Naturalists, in particular those who included a lens focused on the social content. He mentions regularly Zola, Flaubert, Maupassant, Daudet etc. From English literature his favourites were clearly Charles Dickens and, very dear to him, George Eliot. This selection of letters is a perfect antidote to the alienating effect of ubiquitous reproduced images. Reading them is highly refreshing. They succeed in enlivening the aesthetic emotion when contemplating Van Gogh’s very dazzling and unforgettable works. --- I want to thank Jasmine who, during my reading and as a comment to one of my updates, drew my attention to this great documentary.

The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"For great things do not just happen by impulse but are a succession of small things linked together. The main problem when encountering Van Gogh is that his life has become the quintessential artistic myth of our age. The obscure genius ahead of his time, toiling in solitude, tortured by personal demons, driven by a creativity that sometimes spilled over into madness—and so on. You’ve heard it all before. You have also seen it before. His paintings suffer from the same overexposure as does his life story. hangs, in poster form, in dorm rooms and offices; it is used in commercials and as desktop backgrounds. The challenge, then, as with all iconic art, is to unsee it before it can be properly seen. The best way to pop this swollen bubble of myth is, I think, to read these letters. Here an entirely different Van Gogh is revealed. Instead of the mad genius we find the cultured gentleman. Van Gogh could read and write English, French, and German fluently, in addition to his native Dutch. He peppers his letters with references to Dickens, Elliot, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Balzac, Zola. His prose is fluent, cogent, and clear—sometimes even lyrical. His knowledge of art history is equally impressive, as he, for example, compares Shakespeare’s and Rembrandt’s understanding of human nature. Not only this, but he was far from insulated from the artistic currents of his day. To the contrary, he was friends with many of the major artists in Paris—Seurat, Signac, Gauguin—and aware of the work of other prominent painters, such as Monet and Cézanne. But, of course, Van Gogh’s myth, like many, has some basis in truth. During his lifetime he did not receive even a fraction of the recognition his work deserved (though if he had lived a little longer it likely would have). He was often unhappy and he did suffer from a mental illness of some sort, which did indeed lead him to sever a portion of his own ear. What is less clear is the role that his unhappiness and his mental illness played in his work. In our modern world, still full of Romanticism, we are apt to see these factors as integral to his artistic vision, the source of his inspiration and style. Van Gogh himself had, however, quite a different opinion, seeing his suffering and illness as a distraction or an obstacle, something to be endured but not sought. The letters in this volume span from 1872 to 1890, the year of his death. Most of them are addressed to his brother, Theo, who worked as an art dealer in Paris and who supported Vincent financially. There are also a few letters to his sister, Wil, and to his artist friends. From the beginning we see Van Gogh as an enthusiastic and earnest man, very liable to be swept up into passions. His first passion was the church. Following in his father’s footsteps, Van Gogh went to England to work as a preacher. His letters from this period are full to bursting with pious sentiments; in one letter he even includes a sermon, which he composed in English. He quickly grew disenchanted with conventional religion, however, and soon he is pining after his cousin, Kee, who rejects him and refuses to see him. Not long after that he takes in a woman named Sien, a former prostitute, and his letters are filled with his dreams of family life. But in all of these letters, even before he decided to take up art—which he did comparatively late, at the age of 27—Van Gogh show a keen visual awareness and appreciation. He includes long, detailed, and sometimes rapturous descriptions of towns and landscapes. He is also, from the start, independent to the point of stubbornness. He persists in trying to woo his cousin even in the face of his whole family (including Kee herself) discouraging him. He insists on taking in Sien despite the disapproval of nearly everybody, including his brother and his mentor, Mauve. When it came to art he was absolutely uncompromising, refusing to paint anything just for money, and getting into passionate disagreements with some of his artist friends (Gauguin, most notoriously). Van Gogh’s intractability often landed him in trouble. He had a bad relationship with his parents and often quarrelled with his brother, Theo, who was his closest confidant. But it is also, I think, the quality that is ultimately most admirable in him. His personal standards drove him to work hard. He was no savant. His letters are filled with exercises and studies. He was tough on his own work and constantly strove to improve it. And though he sometimes got discouraged, there is never any hint of quitting or compromising. This is the classic story, often told. But it is easy to lose sight of how dreary and dispiriting this life could be, day to day. In films the struggling artist is enmeshed in a moving drama, and the audience always knows it will come right in the end. But for Van Gogh this was a plodding daily reality of struggle and failure, with no audience and no guarantee of ultimate success. That we admire Van Gogh for persisting is, in large part, because his art was truly great. But what would we think if he was mediocre? This, you might say, is the paradox of persistence: We admire those who persist in the face of struggle when they have genuine talent; but when they do not, the spectacle becomes almost pathetic. What would we think of a man financially supported by his brother, constantly quarrelling with and alienating his parents, toiling away in isolation, who produced nothing beautiful? We might be inclined to call such a person naïve, foolish, or even selfish. Whether we admire or scorn stubbornness, in other words, depends on whether it eventually pays off. But in the meantime nobody can know if it will, least of all the stubbornly persistent person. It is, in short, a great risk. Yet it cannot be said that Van Gogh wagered everything on his talent, since there is not even a hint of calculation or self-interest in his continuing persistence. He is so manifestly, uncompromisingly, absolutely obsessed and absorbed by art that there is no other option for him. Even when institutionalized and hospitalized he thinks of nothing but when, how, where, and what he can paint next. And though he at times expresses regret for the sacrifices this entails—he is especially vexed by the toll it takes on his love-life—he never discusses art with even a touch of bitterness. He is willing to live in a hovel and survive on crumbs if it means he can afford paint. To see such unqualified devotion, not in a novel or on a stage, but in the real, intimate context of his daily life is (to use a hackneyed word) inspiring. Vincent's story had a tragic ending. On a summer day in July he walked into a wheat field where he was painting and shot himself in the chest. He survived two more days, finally passing away in his brother’s arms on July 29. The circumstances surrounding this death are rather remarkable, and I don’t wonder that two biographers, Naifeh and Smith, have raised questions about it. The tone of his final letters, while troubled, are far from despairing. He even includes an order of paints in his final dispatch to Theo. And it is also extraordinary to think that a man who had shot himself in the chest could walk a mile back to the inn, or that a man locally known for his mental instability could get a gun. The recent film, (which I haven’t seen), is focused on this question. Theo did not long survive his brother: he succumbed to syphilis within just six months. Theo had married his wife, Jo, less than two years earlier, which proved an extremely fortunate circumstance—for art’s sake, at least—since it was Jo who championed Vincent’s legacy and who published his correspondence. Theo and Jo’s only son, named after his uncle Vincent, was responsible for founding the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which I recently visited. To any who get the chance, I highly recommend this paired experience, for the letters and the paintings are mutually enriching. Few people in history seemed to have lived so entirely for the sake of posterity: churning out paintings which few people saw, writing letter after letter few people read, creating a story and an oeuvre that now have the power to tear you in two."

You have such a list, don't you? No? Will you think about making one? It consists of the books that a large majority of your fellow humans believe are representative of what is most significant about this gift you have received, which we call life. Lots of the books that should go on that list are not necessarily ones you would pick from a book store or library shelf. It's okay to put a book on the list out of a mysterious sense of obligation that you might feel. And once on the list, if you begin to read and it does not speak to you, that is okay too. There will be others who will. Only be patient with this book. It may take you a few pages to become interested in the author and to see in his struggles to be true to a calling lessons for your own life. This book is a compendium of letters from Vincent van Gogh. It does not contain all of Van Gogh's letters. But the letters selected (mostly to Van Gogh's brother Theo) tell a fairly complete story of Van Gogh's inner life. Now and then the editor will insert snippets of Van Gogh's life and circumstances at the time of the letter so that we have a good context for the letter we are reading. Lots and lots of letters consist of Van Gogh pleading with his brother to send him money (Van Gogh sold the grand total of one painting during his lifetime) but somehow even these letters are important to the slow vision of Vincent that you are gradually forming and befriending as you read. Not to mention the glimpse these letters give you of true friendship and devotion between Vincent and Theo. But why is this one of those books that should be placed in your Lifetime List? Someone once said that vocation is that place where your heart's joy meets the word's great need. And I think that this book shows you one man's struggle to develop and remain true to the inner joy that art brought to him and to have that joy be useful, of service to others. He says in an early letter, when he is discovering his aptitude to draw and paint: ""I feel a power in me which I must develop, a fire that I may not quench, but must keep ablaze, though I do not know to what result it will lead me, and shouldn't wonder if it were a gloomy one. . . "" And indeed he kept the blaze of that power throughout his short life even when gloominess was all there was. The power was kept alive sometimes by a fiery, consuming enthusiasm and sometimes by the cold steel of will and duty. But always there was that practice, practice, practice the need to align through visual description and color the emotions elicited by nature, by the poor peasants, simple objects and ordinary people he insisted in painting. At some point, the constant practice of his craft would have allowed him to paint pictures that would sell. But that would have been a departure from that place where his heart's joy met what he saw as the world's need. This a book for your Lifetime List because we are all called (and a call can come from you or from outside of you) to find that joy and find a way to make it useful."

The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have had an interest in painting since my younger days. I never painted myself, nor could I draw or sketch, yet I was drawn into this branch of art. Perhaps it is because I had a poet's mind or perhaps it is because I'm a reader who learned to imagine and read between the lines. Whatever the reason is, I enjoyed viewing them and forming my own interpretations, even though my idea of the painting vastly contradicted the idea of its author. In my twenties, I read about the different periods of art and famous artists and later, started visiting art galleries. This is the time when Van Gogh came across me. I have no understanding of paintings; I'm only an admirer. Yet Van Gogh's paintings captured me from the onset. I think it is mainly due to the colors he used and also the expressions of his figures. There is such a real and humane touch to his paintings. Later on, I read of his life and I felt an immediate connection, a sort of an odd kinship with him. He was undervalued and misunderstood, something I could personally relate to. All these reasons made this selected collection of letters by Van Gogh a pleasurable read. The letters, most written to his brother Theo Van Gogh, express Van Gogh's thinking on life and art. They are profound. Notwithstanding what is thought of him, he wasn't eccentric or anti-social. His isolation was a result of his devotion and dedication to his painting - his final chosen field. Through these letters, Van Gogh expresses in detail his perspective of contemporary and past renowned painters and their works. His attention is specifically fixed on the impressionists who he admired and who he wished would improve their style to suit modern times. He being a post-impressionist, he wanted the impressionists to break the barriers and expand their horizons. Most of all, however, these letters are immensely valuable for they give a good insight into the artistic view of the painter. He was drawn by nature. The inspiration arose for him from everyday details of nature and human life. And he loved colour; bright and vivid colors. He was criticized for lack of a technique, so he worked on form and value more diligently. But it is the colourfulness of nature that inspired his art and compelled him to draw and paint. Apart from art, Van Gogh's views on life are profound. He also talks of the lonely life of an artist but maintains that an isolated and solitary life is needed for a devoted artist. He was well aware of how he was viewed by society. . He was not resentful though. On the contrary as his own words say Yes, Vincent, you were a true friend. Your words and your works are living proof of that."

While the book's synopsis is written accurately, the letters share emotions that a summary cannot. Finally, the song ""Starry Starry Night"" is out of my head."

His gorgeous use of colors, stunning textures and haunting self-portraits have captured my heart for most of my life, and, after seeing endless quotes from his letters written to his brother on Tumblr, I decided to pick up this collection, and this has quickly become some of my favorite pieces of writing that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Vincent van Gogh was an artist both as a painter but through his writing as well. He is one of the most authentic and effortlessly talented writers that I have poured over with tender musings about life, friendship, a career as an artist to his relationship with religion, mental illness, and his family. Vincent’s vulnerability, sass given both to his brother and artists he clashed with, and relatable descriptions of what its like to live with depression captured my heart and held a mirror up to my own soul. It’s rare for me to stumble upon a piece of text that reminds me that I am not living a solitary existence. Others in history have felt the same way and have gazed upon the same skies in awe and wonder, and that reminder alone will comfort me for a lifetime. I feel a greater appreciation for Vincent’s work and am grateful for the opportunity to get to know an artist whose work has touched countless lives long after he walked this earth. If I could travel back in time, I would do so only to hold Vincent’s hands in my own to say, “I see you. You won’t even be able to fathom how many lives you’ve touched. Thank you.”"

The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Robert Hughes writes in one of his essays on Van Gogh that the myth's around Van Gogh run exactly opposite to the truth. He recommends delving into Van Gogh's letters as a way to get beyond the myths and better understand both the artist and his work. Van Gogh is often given an aura of a mad genius, whose hallucinations and fits gave rise to the intense colors and patterning of his paintings and drawings. In fact, his fits (most likely due to epilepsy) were debilitating, and often kept him out of commission for weeks at a time. Hughes closes and essay saying that Van Gogh was a great painter in spite of his madness, not because of it - and having read his letters, I'm inclined to agree. However, I somehow found the letters both more and less than I expected. The biggest disappointment was that they failed to provide as much insight into Van Gogh's working process and aesthetic ideas than I hoped. Much of his talk about his work is merely a description of recent paintings (at most a vague description of his goals) or a long list of influences. While it's interesting to see who he was looking at, I didn't come away with much more understanding of the piece by piece construction of his paintings, or of any grander aesthetic theory. On the other hand, I now have a much greater understanding of the character and biography of Van Gogh than of any other artist I've ever studied. I can look at any piece, and place where it was in his development, where he was physically and mentally at the time, and what issues he was grappling with in his life. I may not have had much more access to his artistic thoughts, but I'm able to process his work in a much wider context than I was before. And there are many, many interesting anecdotes to be learned - like the fact that the work that he is known for, his famously intense paintings and hatched drawings, were down in less than three years - from 1887 to 1890 (a period during which he produced over 1000 combined paintings and drawings). I also have some gripes with the editing of this edition - the letters are interspersed with brief biographical sketches which contextualize the letters, but there are also many letters left out. Without having read every single letter, it's hard for me to know whether the choice of letters reflects and editorial slant (and I have a sneaking suspicion that many letters were chosen for biographical upheaval rather than artistic insight, but have no real grounds for that claim). It's difficult to recommend this book to everyone. Those obsessed with Van Gogh or painting in general might find a lot to learn - and those who enjoy reality TV might get a similar kick out of the bizarre twists and turns of this self-narrated life. The rest will probably find it a bit dull."

I first began my reading of these letters as a way to learn more about the art process, the way to creation coming from the mind of such a gifted artist such as Vincent Van Gogh. I also was interested in his life, his story, and how he got to this end. Personal letters seem to be so much more profitable to me as a reader than fiction, or even a biography. Throughout the entire book I came to feel, and inhabit, his struggle, his pain, his lack of recognition for what he deemed so important in total to his life. I learned through almost countless correspondences that he was rarely given the respect he felt he deserved, and he had just terrible luck with women. It was so sad the difficulties he faced socially. But I never felt once he was suicidal in his thinking. He was a creator, and a sick man obviously, but his genius insisted that he live and make history. I am of the opinion that Van Gogh shot himself in order that his brother Theo’s family could once again thrive as they had fallen on hard times and were suffering. A gut shot is a slow death, and in it one has the opportunity to say what needs to be said to those around him even though the end of life is inevitable. In regards to the art of Van Gogh, the letters presented a complete study in the use of color. I came to understand his selections based on these letters explaining in great detail why he chose specific colors to use in his paintings. The man was authentic, and that is all one might hope to become in such a short and often confusing life we are all faced with. Vincent Van Gogh was gifted in so many ways, and had such high hopes as dreamers often do. The letters are a testament to his great love for his brother, and the many works of genius he left for those of us who today appreciate it. And as good a literary work as anything I have ever read."

I'll just say a few things straight from the heart. Van Gogh and his troubled life is one of those subjects that appeals to one's deepest feelings; to one's heart rather than one's head. Reading these letters gives you a window into Vincent's immense pain. Vincent was a deeply spiritual person who never, during his lifetime, received the recognition that he so richly deserved. An extremely prolific painter with works mainly done in a post-impressionist/neo-impressionist style, some of the works more pointillist than others, Van Gogh's works all seem to have a unique touch of expressionism to them - his style was very distinct and uniquely his own. He never achieved commercial success during his lifetime, most of which was lived in poverty, and he was often severely depressed, leading to self-mutilation and eventually suicide at age thirty-seven. Despite the fact that his life was cut short far too early, he left behind the rich legacy of many deeply emotive paintings and these poignant letters."

Well then, this book is a perfect reason to introduce it. It was . The book is very long, and my copy had an uncomfortably small print. I won't lie, it was boring at times, as everyday life is not always exciting. It was also so often sad, and toward the end downright tragic. So it took me 6 months to read. But in the end, I can say it was . Before reading this book, I wouldn't have called Van Gogh my favorite artist. But I always admired his paintings for being decorative, for the bright colors, distinct style, and textures. Looking around the house, I see his artworks are certainly prominently represented: I have an umbrella, shoes, T-shirt, and sweatshirt with Van Gogh's paintings. Humanity is lucky that Theo had a hoarding tendency and loved his brother Vincent dearly. That's why so many of Van Gogh's letters were preserved and are now available to us. The public rarely gets to glimpse the real-life and struggles of a much-admired genius. This book contains so much! 1) The of XIX century life in a few European countries, as experienced by a rather poor commoner - which is interesting in itself. 2) The life of : evolution from deciding to try it out, to learning and struggling, to finding personal style and meaning, to persevering against critics. A painter's life is also a lot about finding cheap but good quality paint, materials, and models. 3) Van Gogh's dialogue with the contemporary : the successful and upcoming artists of his time, the old masters. It was interesting to read his opinions, criticism, analysis, and admiration of their works and find out about personal relationships with those he was acquainted with. 4) What Van Gogh read and what he thought of them. I really loved those passages in the letters! He loved Zola and Tolstoy; he commented on Poe and Dickens. Also, he drew parallels between painting and literature. 5) Van Gogh's . He certainly didn't have an easy time of it. But it was even more admirable how he took so many setbacks with kindness, perseverance, and hope. His longing for companionship, community, and family broke my heart. When he encountered obstacles, I so wanted to scream: ""HE'S VAN GOGH JUST LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY!!!!!!!!!"" He was just a great person! His love and respect for people, including shunned disgraced women and the poor working class, sounded so contemporary to me. 6) The struggle with . The way he described experiencing and coming to terms with his condition also sounded surprisingly contemporary to me. Which means his thoughts were probably revolutionary for his time. 7) His approach to work, his impeccable , and conviction. It's a lesson in being hard-working and driven. It was also interesting to see how the ideas for his paintings were born, learning some details of their creation. For instance, he came up with the Starry Night and pondered painting it for two years before actually doing it. 8) Surprisingly, the book is also simply . I'm not sure why it was such a shock, but I didn't expect the language to be descriptive, imaginative, piercing. Van Gogh is a painter, but he could have been a novelist or philosopher. His words shook me to the core and broke my heart some times, inspired and uplifted me at other times. Ultimately, it adds up to a story of a - arguably humanity's favorite kind of tale. It's a story of a man driven by internal conviction, who gets knocked down time and time again but gets up, no matter how hard it is, until he can get up no more. But the way he does it makes you feel that his struggle wasn't in vain. He did what he believed in, and ."

It doesn’t contain all of the letters, namely because Vincent was quite a prolific, and very eloquent, letter writer, and Theo was one of those people that kept everything, which means that we literally have a copy of all of the letters that he sent Theo, as well as some that he sent to others (including his sister Wil, and some of his friends). Then again, this was back in the days when people namely communicated by letter, but then we live in an age where people mainly communicate by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype, and I’m sure there are people out there that keep pretty much every message sent to them. Anyway, the letters are divided into two sections – those when Vincent was a priest and missionary, and those where he was an artist (though this is my division). The book divides them into sections based on where Vincent was living at the time, and he certainly moved about quite a bit. What the letters do is that they give us a insight into Vincent’s thoughts and feelings, as he did pour out his souls in these letters. We see him when he is joyful, and when he is frustrated, and we even learn about the loves of his life (there weren’t many mind you), as the thoughts that are going through his head as he his creating his works of art. Many of us know Vincent the artist, but there are more facets to his life than the works that hang in many of the galleries around the world. For instance while he started off working as an art dealer, he fell out with his employer and ended up at theological college. It is interesting to read his letters from this stage of his life as he seems to be quite fundamentalist, however as it turns out that theology wasn’t down his alley either, so he decided to become a missionary to the Dutch miners. Actually, this aspect of his life probably isn’t all that surprising considering his father was also a preacher. However, there is theology, and that can actually be pretty dull and boring at times – while I enjoy philosophy and discussing theology, I discovered going down the road of formally studying it simply didn’t create the same desire in me than simply casually reading about it and chatting with my friends (or even writing posts on the internet), so I can relate to Vincent in that regards. One thing that stands out is that he really didn’t seem to know how to get along with people. In a way he was a but of a drifter, and he was very unlucky in love. For instance, he falls in love with a relative, and she basically tells him that there is no chance in hell, and he literally carries on about it for the next three to four letters. This is the beauty of these letters because we really get to see the struggles that he faces when attempting to relate to people, and while he constantly tries to tell us that he is over her, he not only continues to write about her, but he also continues to attempt to get in contact with her – ah, what it is to be young, in love, and socially inept. Most of the second part of the book we follow his journey as he learns the art of becoming a painter, and he was very fortunate that his brother continues to support him throughout this endeavour. Van Gogh never really had any money, which meant that he rarely, if ever, had the opportunity to paint people (you needed money, and friends, to paint portraits). Well, near the end of his life, when he was in St Remy, and in the asylum, you do start to see more portraits (such as the doctor and the postman), but in most cases he is stuck painting landscapes and still lifes (and a number of self portraits as well). One of the best ways to read this book is to follow his paintings as he talks about them (as I was doing with the updates). Mind you, as we come to the end of his life, his output literally goes through the roof (though for a while he was not allowed to paint, namely because he would have psychotic attacks and attempt to swallow his paints), but before his death he was literally painting one painting a day (sometimes two). There are also quite a few paintings of the asylums that he was in, some of them quite famous. Oh, and we can’t forget the sunflowers either (and he actually painted quite a few of them). Another thing that I noticed was that most of his famous paintings are actually in the major galleries around the world, including the MOMA and the d’Orsay (I would love to see Starry Night, but I doubt I will ever make it to New York to do so). Vincent and his brother must have had one of those very special relationships, because after Vincent died, he brother didn’t last all that long, and he died leaving behind his wife Jo and his son Vincent. Yet, it was his sister in law’s persistence that has turned Van Gogh from a shunned artist into one of the greatest painters of the 19th Century. However, sometimes I wonder what might has been, because by the end of his life, his skill as an artist was starting to become known among the critics. Still, it was Jo’s desire for the world to see the beauty of Vincent’s art that has resulted in his works hanging in museums right around the world. Anyway, I’ll finish off this post with some of his paintings. I have also written three blog posts on Vincent as well, one from when I visited the , one of a special exhibition there , and one of an exhibition of his works that . This is a painting of his doctor, Dr Gauchet: This one of the many paintings of sunflowers that he did: And finally this is of his room in Arles:"

As a musician, I found these letters inspiring in parts. Be warned, most of what you'll read is about money, painting supplies, and what he happened to be working on at the moment and when he expected to finish, but he will occasionally talk about his philosophies on art and his personal thoughts and troubles. Make no mistake, he was indeed a tortured individual, but he was highly read and hyper-aware of the world of art. I was a little surprised how devoted to Japanese art he was even though I knew it was an influence. He was almost obsessed with them. There are a handful of very sad moments here where I felt compassion for him. I truly believe he was one of the most unlucky artists ever while he was alive. Two weeks ago, I visited the New York Met and saw many of his most famous paintings including the Cypresses (incredible), and its a real shame no one appreciated him while he was alive because that's pretty much all he was living for. He talks at great length about other contemporaries and, of course, about Paul Gauguin. He and his brother Theo, who financed Vincent, made a poor decision when they asked Gauguin to join Vincent. They should have chosen another, in my opinion. Even though Vincent has nothing but kind words about Gauguin, one gets the sense he was a knave. For whatever reason, one particular passage Van Gogh wrote about death and the stars in the sky made a lasting impression on me."

Not out of sadness but out of love for his dignity, passions and unwavering commitment, both artistic, social and in hindsight, political, to the infinite possibilities of art of which he humble only considered himself a forbearer paving the way for more important artists to come who would truly be able to paint the essence of all people, not poses, artificial scenarios etc. but the most magical event of all; reality. I have travelled to many cities in the world to be able to stand in front of his Reality and feel that he is my constant companion in life. Not just as an artist, but then, no great artist is just a ""great artist,"" if that was all he was he would be a fraud and acute viewers, listeners, readers etc. would immediately see through him, but instead as a true friend of mine, a man who loved artists and people above art, saw the world in its beauty and splendor in shades, light and types of paint. A man who worried about his brothers health (and G's) above his own and his art. A rich and deep thinker who readily accepted his lot in life if he could just paint and draw without causing pain to others and without being a burden to them. In general I am not in favor of publicizing personal and private letters of people who have left us behind, but in this case the world of words and thoughts would be as infinitely poorer without these surviving letters as the world of images would be without his peerless paintings."

For all that, people still persist in thinking that life is flat and runs from birth to death. But life, too, is probably round, and much greater in scope and possibilities than the hemisphere we now know. Van Gogh will never not be a fascinating character. He reminds me a thought of , who eloquently stated that full self-expression - the creation of art , if you will, whatever that ""art"" means for each person - is the meaning of all human life; and that for that end, each of us should seek to become more than a poet: we should seek to become the poem itself. Van Gogh made himself, no doubt, a poem: through his drive and his fervor, his relentless dedication to his art, and through the cultivation of his eye, his unique gaze onto the world, that so clearly is mirrored in these letters. His whole life burnt on the fires of his passion; the beautiful passages contained in these letters speak of nothing other than that: his reflections on his art, the world around him, his life, all of it nothing other than that burning passion. Some of these quotes rightfully belong among the greatest in world literature; it does make one wonder what van Gogh would be able to accomplish had he ever the idea of writing an actual literary work. On that account, it is most certainly a worthwile read. Unfortunately, his letters are also full of paint orders, Biblical sermons (to each his own, but I frankly could not be more bored by his period of religious fanaticism), and relatively uninteresting descriptions of landscapes. On one hand, literary genius; on the other, the very essence of boredom. Frankly, I think a better selection of these letters would have created a better book; for, regardless of the many beautiful passages I could extract from this edition, I could still point out some beautiful passages from van Gogh's letters I have read elsewhere and were not included in this edition*. And to add to that, it should be mentioned there were several typos and edition mistakes on this ebook, which I really did not expect from Penguin Books. Overall, no matter how mainstream his paintings are, van Gogh will remain to me a source of perpetual wonder and amazement. If, like me, you too have become fascinated, I suggest you take a closer look at him through and 's . * The fact that this passage didn't make it to this selection of letters? Absolutely criminal."

Hence I shall humour her.” “What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love malgré tout, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion.” “How much sadness there is in life. Still, it won’t do to become depressed, one should turn to other things, and the right thing is work, but there are times when one can only find peace of mind in the realization: I, too, shall not be spared by unhappiness.” “It may be politic to keep what one feels to oneself, but it has always seemed to me that sincerity is a duty, especially for a painter - whether people understand what I say, whether they judge me rightly or wrongly, is neither here nor there as far as I am concerned” “How does one become mediocre? By complying with and conforming to one thing today and another tomorrow, as the world dictates, by never contradicting the world and by heeding public opinion!” “That art is something which, though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone, but wells up from a deeper source, from man’s soul” “The color laws are unutterably beautiful, precisely because they are not accidental. Just as people have ceased to believe in arbitrary miracles, in a God who capriciously and despotically changes his mind, but are beginning to be filled with greater respect and admiration for, and faith in, nature, so also, & for the same reasons, I think that the old-fashioned ideas in art of innate genius, inspiration, &c, must be, I would not say discarded, but re-examined closely, verified and - modified very considerably.” “Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of you can’t’ once and for all.” “Let people talk rot as much as they like about technique in pharisaical, hollow, hypocritical terms - true painters are guided by that conscience which is called sentiment. Their soul, their brains, are not there for the sake of the brush but the brush for their brains. Furthermore, it is the canvas which is frightened of the real painter, not the painter who is frightened of the canvas.” “Still, I would sooner paint people’s eyes than cathedrals, for there is something in the eyes that is lacking in a cathedral - however solemn and impressive it may be. To my mind a man’s soul, be it that of a poor beggar or of a streetwalker, is more interesting.” “I have absolutely no objection to the countryside, since I grew up in it - I am still enchanted by snatches of the past, have a hankering after the eternal, of which the sower and the sheaf of corn are the symbols. But when shall I ever get round to doing the starry sky, that picture which is always in my mind?” “For look: people used to think that the earth was flat. That was true, and still is today, of, say, Paris to Asniéres. But that does not alter the fact that science demonstrates that the earth as a whole is round, something nobody nowadays disputes. For all that, people still persist in thinking that life is flat and runs from birth to death. But life, too, is probably round, and much greater in scope and possibilities than the hemisphere we now know.” “They say - and I am very willing to believe it - that it is difficult to know oneself- but it isn’t easy to paint oneself either. So I am working on two self-portraits at the moment - for want of another model.” “But there is no sadness in this death, this one takes place in broad daylight with a sun flooding everything with a light of pure gold.” “...in short, I am trying to recover, like someone who has meant to commit suicide, but then makes for the bank because he finds the water too cold.” “For me, life may well continue in solitude. I have never perceived those to whom I have been most attached other than as through a glass, darkly.”"

It is a sort of double transfiguration occurring in both the creator and the object. That is, the artist is changed through the creation of the object, and the physical world is changed into a spiritual object by the artist. The object (the painting) is proof of the transformation. Vincent’s art was the residue left behind after a heightened state. His ascent or mania, in many ways, resembled the behavior of mystics. There is a break down of the real and a descent into the super-real where the world becomes a mirror for the intensity of feeling. This is manifest in the amorphous gestalt and intense tinctures found in his later works. One can warm their hands at his fires, feel the chill of his winds, and swim in the many faceted greens that take the viewer deep below the surface. The layers of paint, the fine comb of his brush, all bring the world into focus. Therefore, we believe we can touch the rooms, the fields, the winding roads. We know too desperation in a darkened church and in a murder of crows. These are the things that make Vincent’s work so striking today. It is that we feel it, all these years later. And we feel these letters. Reading them is like striking flint on bone. There’s something hot burning alongside something cold. There’s something primordial about his fears. There’s something familiar about his hopes. The two most important things during the entirety of Vincent's life can be reduced to two : God and his brother Theo. Vincent spent two years as a lay missionary preacher attending to the needs of the poor in the capacity of teacher and visiting the sick. When he was cast off by the evangelical committee, for his radical lifestyle, his love of the poor and down trodden continued. I can't help but think, Theo's love and devotion to Vincent over the years (years which spanned more than a decade of poverty and mental anguish) was truly a gift. Theo was the only one to stick by him, to champion him; and to see a bit of the Devine in his awkward and long-suffering brother. Theo helped him to survive, paid his bills, sent money. Without Theo, there would be no Vincent Van Gogh. No art hanging in all the major galleries of this world. Coincidentally, Vincent's brother's name comes from the Greek, meaning “God's gift.” It is derived from the ancient Greek Theodōros, which comes from the word theos, meaning “God” and dōron, translating to “gift. I think, Vincent made art to express his experience of the One for the other. How fortunate for us, not only to have the art, but to have these letters. If we consider his words closely, we can see how fervently he wished to express the depth of his experiences and how earnestly he wished for their approval. These letters were necessary for his art. They transformed him into the artist he became. His letters speak to the need of a man working his way into himself. Listen, how he calls himself forth; how he dares himself, confesses himself, reveals himself. Through this self, he pulls the most distilled and refined experiences to the surface. We meet Vincent Van Gogh."
The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The habit of reading whatever I feel like from the stack of books it keeps piling in my bedroom led me to these beautiful Letters of Vincent van Gogh. I was not expecting much from them, maybe some insight into van Gogh depressive character or perhaps some everyday experiences from the time he lived, maybe getting a better idea of what it means to be an artist. Vincent, however, delivered much more than expected. The letters are separated in periods of his life which coincide to where he was living. This way you have a clear idea how he was seeing his world develop in each stage: the early period while he was studying to be an art dealer and how he was beginning to doubt the path laid for him; his life in England and how he was starting to get acquainted with his spiritual and deeply humane side; his return to his family house and the difficulties of this due to his strong personality which would not yield to the rules of society; his time in Paris where he lives with his brother and so practically we have no record from him; his life in Arles in the south of France where he would eventually live with Gauguin; his time in Saint-Remy, the metal institution where he spent some time; and finally Auvers-sur-Oise where he would eventually commit suicide. The above however cannot convey how touching, powerful and full of wisdom his letters were. From the very beginning, Vincent describes his surroundings with a color pallet as he was painting it. Not only that, he was also great in describing how he felt contemplating the things he described. There is a particularly touching moment when he describes to Theo how his pupils in England who had nothing to eat were treated badly by the headmaster. Of course this was just a prelude to Vincent's search for spiritual enlightenment which would end in failure as he was too much of an ascetic and the religious authorities considered he was mad. However, Vincent's passion was just a character trait. This passion would always provide him with the strength to live a miserable life; economically dependent of his brother Theo. While this would have filled others with resentment, Vincent affection to Theo was present from the beginning and only once in all his letters reprimanded his brother. In person it was completely different as Theo could not stand to live with him while they shared lodging in Paris. Eventually, Vincent would move on, continuing working on his ideas of what should be painted and how; asking Theo for money; arguing with friends and family; and living with hardly any food. It is impossible to condense in a short review van Gogh's life experiences, but if any of the above interested you, it will be worth your while reading his letters."

I read this to separate the myths from the truths and I figured the best way to do this was to get it from the man himself by reading his letters. Noting this Penguin edition includes a selection of his letters I read delphi complete works of Vincent Van Gogh illustrated which includes every letter, not realising it would be 2000, some weeks many letters would be written, and where they would be very long. Reading both editions in tandem made it doubtful that I would finish before the end of year, and reached 1884 in the Delphi edition. Having finished the Penguin edition, I found the Delphi edition helpful to fill in details in the summary given in the Penguin edition. For the way I read I am not sure if I could have appreciated the Penguin edition as much without the chunk I read in the Delphi edition. My knowledge of Van Gogh is filtered with popular myth and the memoir written by his sister-in-law, Jo van Gogh-Bonger. In reading Vincent van Gogh’s own words, a portrait was beginning to emerge, without the gloss, of a very complicated man who is well read, intelligent, stubborn, pushy, with a mixture of kindness and selfishness. In his low periods his obsessional streak is more prominent, but what also comes through is he forgives and how he tolerates the flaws of others. As I kept reading, I realised this was not just the story of Vincent van Gogh but of his younger brother, Theo, as well. Theo supported van Gogh financially and also tried to be his agent. Without Theo there would have been no paintings by Vincent van Gogh. It’s hard not to admire both of them, Theo on one income supported several members of his family, and van Gogh is ready to fight the odds of his circumstances and poor health to discover his own painting style, which towards the end of his life is starting to get praise and attention. Some long letters in Delphi edition made it hard to sympathise with Vincent van Gogh but others were astonishing as Vincent van Gogh showed his understanding of art and a philosophy that demanded equality for all and constantly championed the underdog without apology. The Penguin edition filled in the missing letters with commentary that explained the important events. Its chapters are divided with names of the different places Vincent van Gogh lived, and I was pleasantly surprised to find apprx 40+ black and white drawings. In the kindle edition, where I can zoom in on the image, a delight!!!! Here’s a link with some examples I’m glad I read this book and took my time reading it, with a better understanding of the man when I now look at paintings by Vincent van Gogh I see more than what’s in front of me."

It is like I'm now mesmerized by the art, wisdom and tumultuous, emotionally wrenching life of Vincent Van Gogh. It is a huge blessing to the world that these letters were written, and then collected after he died, and published. I actually did of this book prior to writing this review. It is extremely rare for me to do that. In fact, it is the first time ever. This book was so important for me I feel sure I'll be reading it again next year. I used dozens of tabbies, mainly for marking quotable words of wisdom, or marking mentions of books he read. He was a voracious reader of great novels, and of the letters and biographies of other artists."

It is impossible to think ""Van Gogh"" without being aware of the well-known irony of his elevation to the very highest altars of ART (and commerce) after a life cut short by despair and scarcity. In this letters Van Gogh makes his case. Vehemently, honestly and without much embellishments beyond their raw directness, he appeals to his patient brother Theo often for money but even more often for understanding. And even though he might have been difficult and stubborn, he makes all kinds of sense. Among the themes : His religious beliefs, badly shaken by the evidence of hypocrisy and abandonment; his loneliness and desperate ""inopportune"" love for his cousin Kee Vos and the need for female companionship; rows against his father , ex-employers and teachers as well as his admiration for them, often in the same paragraph. And of course his art as the hard-fought vehicle for all that faith and passion, his appreciation for beauty and his hard work to stay afloat. Incredibly touching and sincere, the story of Van Gogh would still be told were the letters to vanish but they certainly deliver us the artist as the genuine article. As his life as an artist evolves against all odds, VG starts to enter more and more into the ""thinking"" behind his ""working"" efforts. Some of the letters he addresses to artists (Bernard, Gaugin) are full of insights into what constitutes art and its meaning. He formulates a life long ambition of forming an artist colony of sorts. He delves into what is a subject worth painting (and what isn't, he was a harsh critic, an honest one), the influence of Millet a constant above all others but also the beauty of Japanese prints and the old Dutch masters. Van Gogh comes across as a very intelligent and aware artist able to follow the art and literary worlds despite his desperate plight. His search for authenticity and quality is relentless and may have been the final straw that rendered him depressed, sick and spent even when things were just starting to look rosier. One of the best books one can read about art just because it is honest to a fault and direct."

After reading this short collection of Vincent Van Goghs letters, he would certainly be one of my three picks. His letters really amazed me, he was so eloquent and thoughtful. He really had a way with words, almost lyrical. While reading I came across many sequences where I just wished he knew what the future held for him, how much his art would be valued after he passed, how he is one of the most famous artists in history, how he achieved truly lasting success. His determination and his deep love for art is admirable. ""I will make drawings that will amaze some people."" (p. 30) ""For what am I in the eyes of most people? A nonentity, or an oddity, or a disagreeable man, someone who neither has nor ever will have any place in society - in short something less than the least."" (p. 30) ""In a sense I am glad that I never learnt to paint."" (p. 33) ""I know that nature told me something, that she spoke to me, and that I took down her message in shorthand."" (p. 33) ""(...) Painting is in my very marrow."" (p. 33) ""And withal he ought to have some feeling for the stars and the infinite heavens. Then it is a joy to live!"" (p. 40) ""A man with my temperament can scarcely have success, lasting success. I shall probably never attain as much as I might and ought to attain."" (p. 41) ""What I aim at above all is powerful expression."" (p. 42) ""They were cannibals in the sense that they ate one man, say once a month (what did that matter?), (...) which on the whole was only mildly bloodthirsty."" (p. 44) ""And the dreadful white man with his brandy, his purse, and his syphilis! - when will the world have had enough of him? The horrible white man, with his hypocrisy, his lust of gold, his sterility!"" (p. 44) ""To paint and to love women are incompatible."" (p. 47) ""This flat stretch of country which contains nothing save infinity, eternity."" (p. 61) ""I want to paint humanity, humanity and again humanity."" (p. 61) ""Life is short and vanishes like smoke! But that is no reason for despising the living. And we are right after all to think more of the artists than of the pictures."" (p. 88) ""(...)

I feel better equipped to appreciate Vincent's art after reading this and being able to see how he saw the world. The way he looked at people and color and nature are so astonishing. I've found so much to love in this book that I'll come back to many times throughout my life, I'm sure of it. This book is rife with great quotations so here are some that I loved: ""The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too"" ""Admire as much as you can. Most people do not admire enough."" ""Those who love much, do much and accomplish much, and whatever is done with love is done well.... Love is the best and noblest thing in the human heart, especially when it is tested by life as gold is tested by fire. Happy is he who has loved much, and although he may have wavered and doubted, he has kept that divine spark alive and returned to what was in the beginning and ever shall be. If only one keeps loving faithfully what is truly worth loving and does not squander one's love on trivial and insignificant and meaningless things then one will gradually obtain more light and grow stronger."" ""So what do you want? Does what happens inside show on the outside? There is such a great fire in one’s soul, and yet nobody ever comes to warm themselves there, and passersby see nothing but a little smoke coming from the top of the chimney, and go on their way.""

Few books affect you in such a way that you know you will remember reading them for a lifetime. My whole outlook on art and particularly Vincent Van Gogh’s art has changed forever. A bold statement, I know, but reading the intimate letters between Vincent and his brother Theo, was a look into the mind of an artistic genius. Vincent’s writing is beautiful and lyrical. He paints with his pen just as much as his brush. This is a long read but so worthwhile. We follow Vincent from his early years working in an art dealership, through his life and loves, through his volatile relationship with his family and through the ultimate decline of his mental health. His story is as heart wrenching as it is beautiful. I did not know that he painted so many of his masterpieces from an asylum, and many of his letters read like art lessons. We are truly privileged to have access to such a wealth of knowledge in these letters which were so carefully preserved. My own approach to my own art is forever changed. His writing too is so rich that he could have been a writer if he had so chosen to pursue that path. If you have even the smallest interest in art or if you want to glimpse into the mind of a man who. though imperfect, managed to bring such colour and beauty into the world, I highly highly recommend this. Although not light reading, it is a book which would be in my TOP TEN of all time. Other books will pale in comparison to Vincent’s letters. Beautiful and tragic at the same time, but oh so worthwhile. Five stars is nowhere near enough ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Reading the letters that Van Gogh wrote over his adult life, most of which were to his brother was an intimate way to get to know him. These weren’t written with the intent of giving a window on his life - almost all of his success and recognition came after his death. They really just are letters from a man to his brother - sometimes they get along, sometimes they don’t. Vincent is often angling to get his brother to send him money, to intercede on his behalf with his parents, and to get him to side with him in particular family debates. There was so much I didn’t know about Van Gogh’s life, especially about the time when he pursued a career in the clergy. While you see the discipline that Van Gogh exhibits around his art and the almost fanatical attention to detail, you also see him struggle with the lack of commercial success and then his mental illness. One last thing that stood out to me in reading this - when Van Gogh is describing the subjects of his paintings, he paints with words the same way he paints with a brush. His descriptions are so vivid, so specific, so layered - it is as beautiful to read about how he sees the world as it is to view how he creates that vision in a painting."

Most people do not admire enough. I can't stop admiring his art work. Sometimes I just want to drown myself in them. Anyone familiar with the drawings and paintings Van Gogh produced will certainly observe that he just not created any beauty with his art work, but the beauty that would give people something to think about. During his short, intense life, one will discover that The Letters of Vincent van Gogh highlight many facets of his personality that are suggested by his work as a visual artist. These complete letters linked with brief passages of connecting narrative and showing all the pen-and-ink sketches provide both a unique self-portrait and a vivid picture of the contemporary cultural scene. Vincent van Gogh emerges as a complex but captivating personality, struggling with utter integrity to fulfil his artistic destiny. These letters illuminate his constant conflicts as a painter, torn between realism, symbolism and abstraction; between landscape and portraiture; between his desire to outline peasant life and the exciting diversions of the city though his work; between his uncanny versatility as a sketcher and his ideal of the full-scale finished paintings. Vincent van Gogh wrote at length to friends, fellow artists and his family, above all, to his brother Theo, the Parisian art dealer, who was his confidant. Theo van Gogh was the man who saved even the smallest scrap of paper. There were more than 600 letters he received from Vincent and it is possible due to him, that one can get a detailed insight on Vincent van Gogh. These letters are also a proof of the artistic bond that both the brothers shared. Another amazing aspect that these letters manifest is Vincent's writing eloquence, clarity of thought and ability to describe his art and other artists. While Vincent developed as an artist, he also learned to express his ideas more concisely and fundamentally with same telling effect that one can find in his sketches and drawings. His description of landscapes, people or situations are fascinating of their drawn comparisons. Literature was a big part of van Gogh's life. He, many a times in his letters, reveals his delight and admiration for the works of authors like Hans Christian Anderson, George Eliot, Zola, Charles Dickens, Goethe, and Victor Hugo. His love for written words, he not only shared with his brother but his family too in the early days of him becoming a painter. Van Gogh's life did not simply speed towards madness. After a youth full of false starts and disappointments, his decision to become an artist was unconditional. His sense of isolation found an equivalent of becoming a painter even when the madness was the price that he had to pay."

Both fine offerings in their own right. This collection of correspondence is a deeper delving indeed. I have no legitimate understanding of the visual arts . . . but let's not turn this in to a litany of the things I don't understand, eh?! If you have any artistic leanings whatsoever, Van Gogh is your patron saint. He comes across (in his own words, après tout) as almost entirely noble and sympathetic. Neurotic, yes, but doggedly dedicated. You have to work your way through some tedious religious paeans early on here, but then every book worth its salt tests the reader's patience. Things really get fascinating when Vincent decides to devote himself to art. The specter of failure and futility looms over everything poor Vince does, but the man never gives up. Even with his poor health, poverty, an indifferent public and seemingly God and family lined up against him, this beautiful, gaunt little Dutchman soldiers on. To a man who's played in the same hopeless failure of a rock band for 20 years, and publishes 100,000-word novels on Amazon, Van Gogh's example is mana. It is terribly sad to follow Vincent's slide into madness, all the more so because he is fully aware it is happening. It would seem some consolation that he did begin to earn the respect of his peers and critics alike before his death. True to his character, however, Vincent thought it all rather embarrassing, and himself, wholly unworthy. In summary; I'm a fan-boy for life. Van Gogh's exhaustive studies of his own prosaic environs have me lingering on the familiar view of cold, Lake Michigan, et al, a little bit longer - looking at the world with a new curiosity. That's something, alright."

The letters look like a work of literature, and tell a lot about the different circumstances and challenges in Van Gogh’s life. The letters included many painful and sad experiences in his life that left my eyes wet, such as his unrequited love, threats from his father (guardianship), his illness, the suicide attempt, etc. Moreover, they allowed me to understand the contexts of many of his wonderful paintings, such as the “Potato Eaters”, “the Night Café”, and the “Almond blossoms”. After the completion of the book, I appreciate more the artist as well as the man, who was a very sensitive sympathetic loving person, who suffered a lot, and was lonely, misunderstood, and met with harsh criticism and hardship. I found his relationship with his dearest brother Theo, and the support Theo provided to Vincent throughout his life wonderful and somehow unique. Finally, I also loved Van Gogh’s passion for reading and taste of books, which shows a refined and a well-educated man."

Not only was Van Gogh a profound and deeply symbolic painter, he was also an excellent writer who understood how to use words in the same fashion that he used paint in order to express his profound pathos and admiration of the natural world. A true artist is someone who not only observes the beauty of nature but also lives it within their experience. Van Gogh was an example of the artist as experience, and his letters mainly to his brother Theo capture the essence of his soul and love of art. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a better understanding into the mind of an artist."

I started out with this book but then I kept googling stuff, so soon I shifted to this website. And I am so glad that I did, the book doesn't have all the letters. This website is just a thing of marvel. Giving the readers all the options to, however, they want to read. and above anything else facsimile of original letters. Ever since I saw that Doctor Who episode (the doctor and the Vincent), I wanted to know more and more about him. These letters opened up the window from where you can see into vincent's soul as he pours his heart out to his brother. if you are an art lover (like me) this is your treat. In the letters, Vincent has drawn the entire situation that he is talking about. He is not just an art master but a literary gem as well. His powerful insights on books and poems that he reads, tells us how much power his sight is to see so beyond the surface. His book reviews are a delight. Van Gogh's spiritual thoughts are heavily expressed in his initial letters and then the latter part he talks about his travels and arts he comes across in Europe. We can see his journey as he becomes an artist of a lifetime. We see his growth when he shifts from traditional black brown and dark colors toward more vibrant colors with yellow becoming his favorite. Letters from Saint-Rémy will give a vivid insight into what it is like to suffer from loneliness and depression. Those letters are just painful where he knows he is descending into madness and hallucinations wont stop. It's not just Van Gogh we are all sensitive and words matter. What people say about you and says about your work does affect us It reminded, that how cruel this society is, Vincent is a man of clarity. He knows what he wants and has the courage to pursue it which most of us lacks today. And yet somehow the world around him managed to send this man into darkness. His letters express such depth and character that I'm shocked he never tried to make a living as a writer.I am sure if he had written any book they would be topping the charts just like his painting. His honesty and openness will move you! he is easily my favorite writer now. Vincent was so much far ahead of his time. But there is one more person that I love and respect maybe even more than Van Gogh, And that definitely is Theo. We can open up the whole history and won't finds an example of a brother that Theo is. Not just he has proven himself to be a great brother but an incredible human being. His life is brimming with the traits of compassion, sincerity honesty and love. It's not every day when human such as Theo are born."

Painters understand nature & love her & teach us to see. It is good to love as many things as one can, for therein lies true strength, and those who love much, do much and accomplish much, and whatever is done in love is done well. And not being too troubled by our weaknesses, for even he who has none, has one weakness, namely that he has none, and anyone who believes himself to be consummately wise would do well to be foolish all over again. There may be a great fire in your soul, but no one ever comes to warm himself by it, all that passers-by can see is a little smoke coming out of the chimney and they walk on. To which De Bock retorted, 'Mr Destrée, which is easier, painting a panorama or refusing to paint one? Which is more artistic, doing it or not doing it?' What am I in the eyes of most people? A nonentity or an oddity or a disagreeable person - someone who has and will have no position in society, in short a little lower than the lowest. Very well - assuming that everything is indeed like that, then through my work I’d like to show what there is in the heart of such an oddity, such a nobody. A lucky dog who complains — without reason! And they call me ‘the melancholy one’ and I ask you to congratulate me on a no, nay, never. And get very angry if people tell me that it’s dangerous to sail at sea and remark that one might drown; I don’t get angry because I think they’re wrong in saying so, but because they seem to forget that 'there is safety in the very heart of danger’. defended his worship of 'the love which they, theologians, call sin' So don't study or swot too much, for that makes one sterile. Enjoy yourself too much rather than too little, and don't take art or love too seriously. Anyway, it's not a bad idea for you to become an artist, for when one has fire within and a soul, one cannot keep bottling them up-better to burn than to burst, what is in will out. But what I wanted to say is this: after the period of melancholy is over you will be stronger than before, you will recover your health, and you will find the scenery round you so beautiful that you will want to do nothing but paint. 'an artist greater than all other artists, scorning marble and clay and paint, working in the living flesh.' The painter's role (...) was that of a monk who goes to the brothel every two weeks. practice on this ungrateful planet where 'love of art drives out true love' Theo continued to worry about the repercussions of Vincent's frenetic activity: 'I am always frightened when you work like one possessed, for that is a bound to sap your strength.' But Vincent had no choice, for as he later told Wil, 'It is only when I stand painting before my easel that I feel in any way alive.' it is really quite true that a painter, as a human being, is too absorbed in what his eyes see to have enough grasp on other things in his life. For me, life may well continue in solitude. I have never perceived those to whom I have been most attached other than as through glass, darkly. Well, I have risked my life for my work, and it has cost me half of my reason-all right. Bernhard described to Aurier how the coffin had been covered with yellow flowers, 'his favorite color(...) a symbol of the light of which he dreamed both in his heart and in his work. Close by, too, his easel, his camp stool and his brushes had been placed on the ground beside the coffin.'"

After really delving into his mind, I can maybe fathom the weight of the passion of the artist, what it means to live to express yourself and understand the limits of your own hands. These letters show such an honest and sincere character that they read more like a diary than epistolaries. I am in awe of how such a tormented soul was able to open himself to others and make them feel welcome in his troubled mind. It’s clear that these letters were just as necessary as his art. Along with the solace they brought to his solitude, they express his need to reveal himself, in a way his art never fully could. They are an additional form of expression the artist created for a more confidential and selected audience, where he could candidly reveal himself, without the fear of judgement. As much as one can know about the special bond between Vincent and Theo, I was still struck by the artist’s unconditional love for his brother. His constant longing to be near him and need to respect his space without being burdening his dear one resolved into a relentless flow of letters. Each exchange underlines Vincent’s fervid devotion to Theo, the need he has to feel him close and how much he relied on him. Besides being his brother, Theo was his best friend and main benefactor. Be warned, many of their messages revolve mainly around Theo’s 150 francs monthly allowance, painting supplies, and what Vincent’s new subject was and when he expected to finish. But alongside his needs and daily updates, he will also delve into discussions regarding his latest reads, his philosophies on art and his personal troubles. Every letter serves of a reminder of his tormented mentality, but also the attention he directed towards the world surrounding him and the arts. Van Gogh is now globally one of the most renown and admired artists. Sadly, during his lifetime, he never received due appreciation for his talent or the recognition he sought for so desperately. I sometimes wonder if this awareness could have led to a different fate."

I found the book interesting as it gave an insight into Vincent Van Gogh's life through his letters to his brother Theo and other artists. Popular belief holds that Vincent never quite believed in himself, was poor throughout his short life and he suffered from anxiety and mental health issues. You will learn all of that from the letters through Van Gogh's voice. It is sad that he never got to see how his paintings became some of the best known across the world. The letters are funny, sad, and thought provoking and if you have ever wanted to be inspired to pick up a paint brush and create art, this book is a must!"

What a tremendous and wonderfully odd person he was. Incredibly misunderstood and I felt a lot of empathy for him. I hate that people consider the “starving artists” as a noble and honest pursuit and I was glad that Van Gogh shot that fallacy down. You need comfort and stability to survive. If there is a spirit world, I hope that old Vincent has looked down and seen his work be discovered and held in high esteem throughout the world. Xxx"

Van Gogh’s yearning to be loved and to love comes through so much in his letters, as well as his insecurities with his own work and paintings. He truly did not see himself as great or talented in any respect and it breaks! My ! Heart!!!! We also see a level of distress at the lack of appreciation people had for artists, including himself. The way he is so incredibly in touch with his own feelings, the art world & literature is truly so incredible to see. His letters truly add another level of depth to his character & I think I love him even more now. We also see his relationship with his brother, which is so typical of siblings.

Ask a person off the street about Monet at Giverny, or Gauguin in Tahiti, and you will likely get a blank stare. But most will have heard of Vincent Van Gogh, the crazy sunflower guy who cut off his ear. In our culture, Van Gogh has become a byword for Tortured Artist—so that, in the popular imagination, the romanticism of his brief life threatens to overshadow his art. I confess that I had this romantic image of Van Gogh in my head when I ordered this book in a fit of millennial angst. But when it finally arrived in the mail, I was worried that I could not finish it. The book consists almost entirely of personal letters, filled with the mundane concerns of everyday life. Vincent asks for money from his brother Theo. Vincent asks for a discount on tubes of paint. Vincent quarrels with a friend—et cetera. Vincent does not even start painting until a hundred pages in. So I started slowly, reading a few letters each night before bed. I found I liked this thoughtful but conflicted young man, who in his youth failed at love and everything else besides: preacher, teacher, bookseller, and art dealer. An ordinary biography might have omitted this early period—after all, who picks up a book about Van Gogh if not to read about painting? But this book rewards patience, and careful reading. A young Vincent, studying for the priesthood, makes offhand comments about this or that print catching his eye. As he drifts from failure and failure, this idle ambition blooms, almost imperceptibly, into the fierce conviction that art should be his life’s purpose. And for ten brief but glorious years, Vincent paints, and paints, and paints. And oh, what paintings. Hearing Van Gogh describe the feelings that he pours into his work is profoundly moving—here was a man who felt “deeply [and] keenly”, who wanted desperately to show the world “what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart.” To hear the long train of masterpieces—the Starry Night, the Night Cafe—produced in such a short span is breathtaking; to hear the dissatisfaction he feels, with his own work and with his lack of recognition, breaks the heart. No artist I’ve read better evokes the quality of their work with their prose: Van Gogh is a master of description, which he layers on, observation by observation, like thick impasto strokes. In another life, he might have found a career as a novelist. Of course, all this work comes at a terrible cost. Vincent was always short of money, stretching the patience of friends and relatives; and, to the end of his life, he fell victim to debilitating mental attacks (a condition perhaps exacerbated by overwork). Reading these letters should shatter any myths about Vincent being some sort of Byronic genius, fueled by his madness. Vincent’s mental illness was an impediment to his work, not a muse. His paintings sprang not from flashes of inspiration, but from the prosaic virtue of hard, grinding work. In his words, drawing was “working through an invisible iron wall… between what one feels and what one can do”, and the only way through is “filing through it steadily and patiently”. This may be one of those rare books that can change a person’s life. (I’m young, and the jury’s still out.) I felt ashamed by the lack of conviction in my own life, and felt inspired to do better. But unlike the interchangeable self-help books one can pick off the shelf at Barnes and Noble, the lessons do not feel cheap. Read a little every day, as I did, and gradually you feel as if you are living and learning alongside a real person—a flawed man of profound emotion, who struggled daily with questions of meaning and purpose. When I finished that last, abrupt letter, penned from the lonely village of Auvers, I felt like I had lost a friend."

At times his paragraphs were dull and uneventful, describing aspects of his craft that are hard to appreciate for someone who isn’t studying a masters in post-impressionism or situated at a museum in Amsterdam. But Van Gogh nevertheless rewards your persistence with drops of gold in the form of quote-type wisdom: bombshells that are often built up by his capacity to fluidly delve into a single stream of thought for several pages at a time. It is perhaps this very unique expression within which the mastery of his prose is revealed. The arbitrary seemed to be a point of embodiment for Van Gogh, exhibiting a willingness to bear constant suffering in his health, social status, and peace of mind. It’s as if he says in one of the passages addressing his brother: “I haven’t eaten anything in three days and need money, but if you send me anything I’m just going to spend it on paint”. Clearly, he had sacrificed himself long before he had taken his own life. Nonetheless, his letters demonstrate a stubborn refusal to bask in any self-pity nor indulge in any glorification. His tone is kept strident; his commitment to higher form is single-minded - almost irrational - while his prose is unrelenting in its expression for a yearning towards a deeper connection with the world around him. And more than that, with precise contemplation, the letters foreground his process for rendering the imperfections and aberrations of his subjects as the core of his impression, moving beyond a mere reproduction of the world to articulating a raw, passionate and forceful expression of life. In essence, Van Gogh’s language is just as tasteful and textured as his artworks, fostering a type of prose that dances on the edge of poetry. Through diaristic form, the letters fortify a personal longing to understand the true origins of beauty within the arbitrary, searching for the perfect within the imperfect. Through a relentless command over words and colour, Van Gogh demystifies the pursuits that a true artist yields to, serving as a testament not only to himself as a painter and writer, but as a human being yearning for higher truth and connection."

Books, regardless of who the author is, are the author telling you exactly what they want you to know. Van Gogh's letters are an insight into the everyday mind of an extremely influential thinker in history. It is not often you get to see anything other than the well constructed image of greatness. There are, I believe, two things essential to the human experience - to love and to feel deeply. Van Gogh understood this profoundly. The letters have detail of his life as an artist, and reflections on his living experience of where he is, what he could be — in the clutches of despair, Van Gogh visualises possible moments of serenity, and it is full of soul. There is a specific letter(July 1880, addressed to Theo) which is a microcosm of Van Gogh's life in these letters. It starts out innocuously, becomes an explanation of his poverty of living, and the trickle of emotion becomes a thunderous lament - of being misunderstood, of the dearth of social empathy - and it finally ends in the message that love is what it takes to break the cage. This book can be mundane. It can be tedious. There are moments, however, where it grips you and tears you in a way that only true emotion can. Van Gogh writes that there is a reality that is more real than reality itself - you will find that in these letters."

I've realised that these letters provide light on every aspect of the lives and works of these complex and tortured men. The letters are written as though a fever had dragged the authors out of bed and forced them to pick up an ink pot to put into words what would otherwise have assaulted them if left unspoken. After trying a few different vocations and realising that painting was his genuine calling, Vincent was steadfast in his resolve to pursue it. He was an art dealer, a teacher, a bookseller, a priest, and a preacher, and this realisation hit me hard: we are frequently afraid to try new things in the little amount of time we have before discovering our calling or the endeavour that will give our lives direction for the long haul. Despite all of the difficulties, failures, and setbacks Vincent had to through, he has the most optimistic mentality that I have ever read about. I know that without reading about him and the letters he wrote, I would not have been capable of becoming better. He encourages me to work without thinking about success or to achieve perfection by reflecting on my profession. March has been quite demanding, and I was losing the will to continue any task in a way that would make me feel content that I had given it my all. This is why I was holding onto this book. Vicent wrote so openly about his life in his letters; despite living in a world where he had to struggle for basic necessities like food and shelter, he never stopped putting his love of painting first. Even though every friend and close relative counselled him against painting since they couldn't understand his actual aptitude and zeal for it, he prioritised painting before he thought about feeding himself. I was soothed while reading the letters with a passion and a fresh perspective for my dreams, to make sure that I respect my ideas and never doubt my perceptions. It gave me the courage to take a chance and experiment while also encouraging me to share more of my thoughts with others who can help them. The letters will inspire you to write letters to the people you care about. After reading Vicent Van Gogh, you should be more forthcoming about how you feel about others. Despite having little means of assistance, he made sure to make things easy on himself by being open and sincere with everyone. As Theo Van Gogh cared for his brother Vincent for many years, you would develop a new regard for the person assisting you in realising your dreams. As Vincent did when he wrote about the painters he adored and how books kept him sane with painting, you would write about your passion and wish to reach out to people who are skilled in your line of work so that you can learn all about your trade. You would start respecting your time regardless of how successful you feel in this world or even if you do not, and you would want to leave jobs that only provide you with financial support but do not enhance your creativity for your passion projects. This book would be a better self-help book for people looking for inspiration in literature. It would also teach you about art history, make you fall in love with your abilities, and inspire you to become a better version of yourself. This book would wake you up without the need for an alarm clock to start a new day and make the most of everything you have. Please do read this book if you adore Vincent."

After various career stints in a picture gallery and bookshop, later as a schoolteacher and a lay preacher, failing or being forced out of every position he ever endeavored, the troubled Dutchman becomes a full time painter around the age of 27. This same time he becomes completely dependent on his younger brother, Theo, for all his living expenses. Never marrying and alienating nearly everyone whom he comes into contact with, Van Gogh lives a destitute, itinerant existence, unable to settle anywhere very long. He is nearly always malnourished, often lonely, and occasionally suffers debilitating spells of depression that late in life take the form of nervous breakdowns (as in the infamous offering of his ear to a prostitute). The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh (edited by Mark Roskill) is a curated epistolary collection of his miseries, epiphanies, and banalities, alternately dull and inspiring, an invaluable record of perhaps the most famous painter of all time, who penniless and institutionalized at the age of 37, commits suicide with a gunshot wound to the chest. Vincent's correspondence reflects his concerns, worries, and interests, which evolved with his art and descent into madness. Early on, in his preacher days, he examines theological ideas piecemeal until later disillusionment turns him into a full-blown apostate (“I can very well do without God both in my life and in my painting, but I cannot, ill as I am, do without something which is greater than I, which is my life-- the power to create.”). In his late twenties, early thirties, he struggles in dead-end relationships, falling for women who either fail to return his affections (his cousin Kee Vos) or women of ill repute from the demimonde (the prostitute Clasina Maria Hoornik), confessing his amorous confusion to Theo with, “What a mystery life is, and love is a mystery within a mystery.” He adores certain writers, particularly Charles Dickens, with whom he shares his concerns for social justice. (“But one must learn to read, exactly as one must learn to see, and learn to live.”) And later in life, aware of a movement called Impressionism, he ruminates on what painting means in terms of art, truth, beauty: “Tell him that my great longing is to learn to make those very incorrectnesses, those deviations, remodellings, changes of reality, so that they become, yes, untruth if you like-- but more truth than the literal truth.” For someone better known for his pictures than his prose Van Gogh's writing is very articulate, often extremely precise in its descriptions. That might have been due to his bibliophilia (not just Dickens, but most of the great writers of the 19th century were favorites, especially Balzac, Zola, and George Eliot) but also to his visual background and sensitive nature. In his correspondence it is all peaks and troughs, but his aesthetic appreciation for beauty is vivid and inevitably colorful: “Spring is tender, green young corn and pink apple blossoms. Autumn is the contrast of the yellow leaves against violet tones. Winter is the snow with black silhouettes.” There is a focus to the letters and comparatively little banter. The most banal matters are often due to money. Theo's welfare checks are never enough, as Vincent spends the largess on models, paints, and canvases. Literally, he subsists on stale bread rolls and warm milk (which no doubt had an effect on his physical and mental deterioration, though how much we have no way of really knowing). An artist of mercurial temperament, nothing quite stays with Van Gogh. He burns bridges with friends and family (his tempestuous relationship with his preacher father is often lamented and Paul Gaughin's famous stay with Van Gogh in Arles had been a disaster). A normal life is impossible due to conflicts of personal views with his various employers (he almost definitely had authority issues) and his ceding of financial independence to his brother (in the arrangement Theo acquired ownership of Vincent's work so that it was more of a payment for services rendered than a support check, though Vincent is always asking for more, swearing on “activity,” insisting that he is not “lazy” or “plodding”). Initially euphoric in new locations, discovering places and subjects to paint, he always becomes disillusioned eventually, save Arles, where its bright, beautiful sunshine inspires him to his most prolific work, though his eccentricities alienates the townfolk and they petition for his removal. The only constant in his life in fact is painting. It is the one thing in life that gives him any joy or confidence, the only way to transcend his miseries, so that Vincent becomes single-mindedly determined “to sacrifice all personal desires, to realize great things, to obtain nobleness of mind, to surpass the vulgarity in which the existence of nearly all individuals is spent.” The road for Van Gogh was long and treacherous, filled with self-doubt (for no one would buy his paintings) and extreme poverty. But it was worth it because he understood it intrinsically as his life's calling (""Blessed is the man who has found his work.""), grasping also that all great loves entail some kind of pain: “By painting, one becomes a painter. If one wants to become a painter, if one delights in it, if one feels what you feel, one can do it, but it is accompanied by trouble, care, disappointment, periods of melancholy, of helplessness...” His letters are often punctuated with dreams of an arts community, a utopian vision of cooperation, collaboration, and collectiveness. It's tempting to wonder how Van Gogh would have handled his passions and pain in contemporary life. Would he have felt less alone had he an online community, a way to share his work? Or would he despair at the humbling stats of his Tumblr account, at the inattention due him, at the sheer, voluminous ubiquity of artists and art? Van Gogh is by no means the only unacknowledged genius-- hundreds of others have toiled in anonymity, most of whom only to be utterly forsaken. At least his brother had been one of the most respected art dealers on the Continent (nevertheless, tragically, Theo would die just months after Vincent). Reading these letters, which is akin to reading the diary of somebody's innermost thoughts, I couldn't help remembering my own capricious fortunes in my twenties while I learned to be a writer, struggling with confidence and money, sacrificing a normal life, a good career, stable income, watching friends from university establish real careers in their fields while I pattered along with the vain hope of expressing--as Van Gogh described it, “a sincere human feeling.” Every artist's journey is a different in the details but the arcs are generally the same-- some make it, some don't, and then there are the exceptions like Van Gogh (or more recently Henry Darger and the photographer Vivian Maier) who become spectacularly beloved after death. On my worst days I've been paralyzed by my own self-doubts, though I've been luckier than Van Gogh in life, having found a way to live and even thrive. Some artists, particularly the more sincere ones, don't do their trade for the money or even recognition, but for love. Maybe you're born, maybe you're made, but however you get there beauty makes you feel all is right with the universe and this helps smooth the kinks of living on the edge, at least for a brief, blissful moment. And it is not extraordinary to be moved by life; in fact, it is something you might know just by looking. As Van Gogh said looking up at the night sky over the Rhone, hungry yet spiritually sated: “And all the same to feel the stars and the infinite high and clear above you. Then life is after all almost enchanted.”"

I don't have words to describe how beautiful these letters are, but thankfully I don't need any because the letters speak for themselves. ""Admire as much as you can, most people don't admire enough."" ""I've got nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't enough, what is?"" ""The heart of man is very much like the sea, it has its storms, it has its tides and in its depths it has its pearls too."" ""How right it is to love flowers and the greenery of pines and ivy and hawthorn hedges; they have been with us from the very beginning."" ""Well, that's how it is, can you tell what goes on within by looking at what happens without? There may be a great fire in your soul, but no one ever comes to warm himself by it, all that passers-by can see is a little smoke coming out of the chimney and they walk on."" ""Oh, please give me the freedom to be a bird like other birds."" ""You see, brother, I think of you a very great deal these days, in the first place because everything, all that I have, is really yours, my lust for life and my energy, too, for I am able to get going now with your help and can feel my capacity to work flowing back."" ""What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest of the low. All right then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart."" ""You do realize, don't you, that I'm sure you have saved my life and I shall never forget that. [...] Money can be repaid, not kindness such as yours."" ""Art is something which, though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone, but wells up from a deeper source, from man's soul."" ""To some, woman is heresy and diabolical. To me she is the opposite."" ""I have work and nature here. If I didn't have that, I should turn melancholy. [...] For what is really wretched is loneliness, worries, problems, and the unfulfilled need for kindness and sympathy. Feelings of sadness or disappointment undermine us more than dissipation - those of us, I say, who find ourselves the happy owners of irregular hearts."" ""But when shall I ever get round to doing the starry sky, that picture which is always in my mind?"" ""And in my pictures I want to say something consoling, as music does. I want to paint men and women with a touch of the eternal, whose symbol was once the halo, which we try to convey by the very radiance and vibrancy of our colouring."" ""Well, do you know what I hope for, once I allow myself to begin to hope? It is that the family will be for you what nature, the clods of earth, the grass, the yellow wheat, the peasant, are for me, in other words, that you find in your love for people something not only to work for, but to comfort and restore you when there is a need."" ""It is only when I stand painting before my easel that I feel in any way alive."" ""Ever yours, Vincent"""

I have never perceived those to whom I have been most attached other than as through a glass, darkly. These two sentences are a cry of despair from a man we have romanticized through the ages but have rarely made an attempt to understand. The myth of van Gogh is largely known - a madman misunderstood genius painter who cuts off his own ear in a frenzy and spirals into a vortex of further mental illness and kills himself, all while being a prolific painter producing over two thousand paintings in the span of a decade. Perhaps his paintings are all very well known. The strokes of his brush are immediately discernible even for a person not remotely involved in art. The man, van Gogh therefore, is lost behind the fable. In this book, we read about the man....a man of high intellect and classic tastes; a man who struggled with being misunderstood for his choices in life, a man who quarrelled with his father, a painter who struggled through utter poverty and a brother who passionately writes about the influences of fellow painters, writers and peasants. Reading through the letters filled me with infinite sadness. We are initially introduced to a man whose ideologies are bathed in fervent religious ideologies. When through the course of time the painter in him blooms, he is riddled with tragedies one after the other - he never got the love of a woman that he always wanted. When he took to painting with unbridled optimism, the fear of poverty always loomed large. When his vision of carefully curating a house that could host struggling artists was coming to fruition, his mental illness got the better of him. His paintings were never given the due appreciation in his time and he had to scrape and ask for money, paints and canvas from his brother every single time; it was only natural that the failures were bound to break him and yet...and yet we see rays of positivity in his letters...coherent, passionate and incredibly readable letters. Alas it all had to come to an end when he could not take it any longer. Tenderness for humanity has rarely touched me so. On the other hand, I developed a deep respect for his brother Theo. What a kind brother and true friend to Vincent he truly was! In hindsight, the book, had it contained letters of Theo as well, would have made for such a complete book. This book is one that goes straight to the heart."
The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Last year I went through a period of obsession with Van Gogh - I watched any and every YouTube video talking about his paintings, his process. But so much of the media out there about Van Gogh left me hungry for more - I wanted to know about his life before he was an artist, his relationships. So what better way to learn about him than to read all his letters? I have a few thoughts - one is that it pains me that he is always portrayed as the typical tortured artist type. While this is true (not only did he cut off his ear, but also ate paint and drank turpentine during his attacks), I think Vincent was somewhat of a genius, or at least a savant. He was fluent in several languages, obsessed with literature and art. He studied the art of his peers and artists who came before him obsessively. He is constantly referencing paintings, drawings, books, quoting phrases in different languages. I was extremely thankful for google while reading this, and enjoyed googling every painting and artist he referenced. I can’t help but wonder what he would have produced if he had continued to live. Another thought is how inspired I felt by this book. Even though he struggled mentally, and often felt he was a burden to Theo, he never gave up on his dream of being an artist. He knew that he may never make money from his art. I really love that. He wanted to create an artist’s utopia - his descriptions of decorating the yellow house and dreaming of it being a place that painters could come to stay and work in the French countryside was really touching. Vincent really believed in himself and his ideas. He became a painter out of sheer willpower - he didn’t know what else to do after failing as a pastor - and dove head first into art. I could write a lot more - about how Vincent seemed to be such a good friend, about his sweet relationship with his brother, about the way he describes landscapes and colors and his own paintings. How my heart broke once he started having his attacks, knowing he was leaving the worst moments out of his letters to his brother so as not to worry him. There’s so much to say about this book, and I’m truly thankful that it exists and I got to read it! I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in art history or Van Gogh in general."

And I'll get sleepy listening to their voices explaining the mysteries to me. I'll fall asleep with the book still in my fingers, and it will rain""~Tenesse Williams • This is not an ordinary book, so there won't be any plot/characters evaluation. These are the genuine, sincere letters of Van Gogh, most of them to his brother Theo. • I don't know how to write a proper review to be honest. I am gonna try my best to say a fraction of what needs to be said. • So you probably know this painter, Vincent Van Gogh, the one who painted the starry night, and cut his ear. But that is exactly why you need to read this book, because then you will realise that there is more to Vincent than that frame we put him in. In this book you will be going through Vincent's life with all its turn points, and you will live them. You will be in his skin and experience every bit of feelings. Sometimes you feel you are Vincent, sometimes you feel Vincent is writing to you. You see van Gogh as a human being whose life was a struggle from beginning to end and the only thing that kept him going is art. You will hold proof that art does save lives, even for a bit. • As mentioned in the quote above, I became friends with Vincent. Really good friends to the point that while reading his letters I forget for a second that I and him are two completely different entities. And the fact that he is not fictional makes the bond even stronger. It's like he's from the 1800's and I'm from the 2000's and this book is our means of communication and bonding. This is the second book (after Nietzsche's thus spoke Zarathustra) that made me feel this way. • Vincent is an admirable man. You need to read this book in order to understand. And I really hope everyone adds this to their tbr list. Have a good day!"

If one wants to know what Vincent Van Gogh was like, his letters to his brother and another artist Emile Bernard reveal it all. I learned a lot about him from reading his letters. He was very passionate about color (especially with how he describes scenery like a sunset). With color, he conveyed emotion into his paintings. He was inspired by Realism, Japanese Prints, and Impressionism. In fact, I think his letters conveyed his love for those styles and not Classical art and Idealism. He rather portray peasants, workers, and villagers in his works as opposed to noblemen, royalty, or biblical figures. The letters also reveal his friendship with Gaugin and his excitement of him coming to live with Van Gogh to work on art together. (That was how it ended. So I just realized this was before Van Gogh’s “fits of insanity” started). The artist did not mention anything about depression or suicide ideation, but his late letters to his brother Theo indicated that he was struggling financially, developing insomnia, and eating very little. Maybe, this all resulted to his self mutilation and suicide? From Reading this letters, I concur that he seemed happy and passionate with art, so it is no wonder his suicide must been a shock. Highly recommend it!"

In missives to his family (the greatest number of letters is to his brother Theo) and colleagues his thoughts about religion, society, family, and art past, present, and future are bright, clear, and accessible. He does not shy away from revealing his hopes and passions or the pain he feels from difficult relationships, financial woes, and physical and mental ills. I came away thinking he would at times have been difficult to live with but what a beautiful, beautiful man. I bought this book almost twenty years ago at the Art Institute of Chicago's gift shop during its Van Gogh/Gaughin show. So glad it survived multiple book purges. It will definitely always have a home on my shelves."

Chief among these is how the material form of the letters affects their meaning. For the most part, Van Gogh used a sheet of paper folded in four, so that a single sheet provided four pages. Some 1,200 sheets survive, containing 3,800 pages of letters. He almost certainly wrote a great deal more than this, but it is difficult to conclude accurately how much of his communication — for instance, letters to and from his parents — has been lost. The editors of this edition suggest that the complete correspondence “may have run to more than 2,000 letters” — more than twice the number that survive."

I always had a pretty romantic idea of Vincent Van Gogh (his story is like something right out of Wuthering Heights or an equally dramatic feelings-driven novel). Reading his letters, I was pulled out of that pretty quickly. Van Gogh was a difficult dude. He went through so many different phases with such intensity that just reading his letters was enough to make you say ""Stop that!!"" out loud. But once you get into the last 150 pages of this collection, you see his fervor, mental decline, and sudden outpouring of his biggest paintings. It's a surreal experience.

I earnestly pray that he is at peace and has at last found that true and pure expression of his creative genius that he so single-mindedly sought, in the arms of the Great Artist Himself. Vincent was always striving to convey his feelings and emotions into his paintings; he wanted people to share his love of nature and the country, of simple things and humble people. He did not achieve recognition in his life and suffered both physically and mentally, dying so young. I hope he now knows how loved and appreciated he is now, by so many. Of course, he would have much to say about the art trade today, as he was very critical of the art trade in his day."

It found me at the perfect time, and I've read it almost devotionally over the past two years, a letter or two at a time. What makes these letters so moving is not that Van Gogh was an artistic genius (he was), not that his letters are incredibly articulate and incisive (they usually are), not even that they read like a who's who list of late 19th century artists, both visual and literary (they really do). I would not have cared much about any of these things alone. What makes these letters so moving is the portrait they paint of a man who lived in absolute obedience to his intuition wherever it took him, from poverty to madness to death, in the midst of all of these banal forms of human suffering (he was lovelorn, jealous, beholden to his brother for money, insecure, not very talented at first, sickly and probably alcoholic). Such common problems, common to all of us, but made sublime in contrast to this absolute devotion to the work, the work, always the work, always paint and canvas and pencils and paper, never an end to the work he knew was his. In spite of everything, he painted. ""Life itself, too, is forever turning an infinitely vacant, disheartening, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily.

The letters start from his early 20s all the way through to his death at 37, following him on his journey as an art dealer, studies, preacher and finally, artist. I was surprised to read her had come to London as he jumped around Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, France). His letters really brought out his character and it’s been an experience getting to know him on a more personal level than just articles. Many of his letters held such comforting messages. His writing is beautiful, expressive and open as he talks about nature, art, literature, family (esp. Theo) and faith. The descriptions of images he sees with his eyes and the wonderful detail of the colours and landscapes are just wonderful. His letters show us how he was learning his way through life and not all the lessons were happy, sometimes he was at fault, but nevertheless he did not deserve the treatment he received from people and society. It was great to see his enthusiasm as he developed as an artist and how his work changed, especially towards the end of his life. I wish we could have seen more of Theo’s letters, if only Van Gogh had saved them! Admittedly some letters were dull and boring, because they were correspondence, not every letter will be so descriptive. I appreciate Van Gogh was a lover of Hugo’s Les Mis! It was also interesting to learn how Theo reported that his work was coming into the light of appreciate and fame before he died, I had always assumed his work was never given a second glance until after his death. Though, obviously, his fame came to prominence thanks to Theo and Johanna. Anyway, here's a long list of quotes that stood out/struck me as a reader… ... ""How I wish I could have another talk with you about art, but we'll just have to keep writing to each other about it. Admire as much as you can, most people don't admire enough"" ""Do go on doing a lot of walking & keep up your love of nature, for that is the right way to understand art better & better. Painters understand nature & love her & teach us to see"" ""He enjoyed the city, 'especially the streets in the evening when it is more or less foggy and the lamps are lit', or when the sun went down in a park 'behind the elm trees, whose leavea are now coloured bronze. Over the grass lay that mist Anna wrote about, and a stream runs through the park in which you can see swans swimming. The acacia trees in the playground have already lost many of their leaves; they can be seen through the window in front of my desk- sometimes they stand out dark against the sky, sometimes the sun can be seen rising red in the mist behind them.'"" (Isleworth) ""But that does not alter the fact that the country here is very special and very picturesque, everything speaks, as it were, and is full of character"" ""The cold is too awful for me to care whether summer is coming or not"" ""So instead of giving in to despair I chose active melancholy, in so far as I was capable of activity, in other words I chose the kind of melancholy that hopes, that strives and that seeks, in preference to the melancholy that despairs numbly and in distress"" ""What is true is that I have at times earned my own crust, and at other times a friend has given it to me out of the goodness of his heart. I have lived whatever way I could, for better or for worse, taking things just as they came... And I must continue to follow the path I take now. If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost. That is how I look at it- keep going, keep going come what may"" ""Then there is the other kind of ne'er-do-well, the ne'er-do-well despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great longing for action, who does nothing because his hands are tied, because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end. Such a one does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless instinctively feels, I am good at something! My existence is not without reason! I know that I could be a quite different person!"" ""A caged bird in spring knows perfectly well that there is some way in which he should be able to serve. He is well aware that there is something to be done, but he is unsble to do it. What is it? He cannot quite remember, but then he gets a vague inkling and he says to himself, 'The others are building their nests and hatching their young and bringing them up,' and then he bangs his head against the bars of the cage. But the cage does not give way and the bird is maddened by pain. 'What a ne'er-do-well,' says another bird passing by- what an idler. Yet the prisoner lives and does not die. There are no outward signs of what is going on inside him, he is doing well, he is quite cheerful in the sunshine. But then the season of the great migration arrives: an attack of melancholy. He has everything he needs, say the children who tend him in his cage- but he looks out, at the heavy thundery sky, and in his heart of hearts he rebels against his fate. I am caged, I am caged and you say I need nothing, you idiots! I have everything I need, indeed! Oh, please give me the freedom to be a bird like other birds. That kind of ne'er-do-well of a person resembles that kind of ne'er-do-well of a bird. And people are often unable to do anything, imprisoned as they are in I don't know what kind of terrible, terrible, oh such terrible cage. I do know that there is a release, the belated release. A justly or unjustly ruined reputation, poverty, disastrous circumstances, misfortune, they all turn you into a prisoner. You cannot always tell what keeps you confined, what immures you, what seems to bury you, and yet you can feel those elusive bars, railings, walls. Is all this illusion, imagination? I don't think so. And then one asks: my God, will it be for long, will it be for ever, will it be for eternity? Do you know what makes the prison disappear? Every deep, genuine affection. Being friends, being brothers, loving, that is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic force. Without these one stays dead. But whenever affection is revived, there life revives. Moreover, the prison is sometimes called prejudice, misunderstanding, fatal ignorance of one thing or another, suspucion, false modesty"" ""I cannot tell you (though fresh problems arise & will continue to arise every day), I cannot tell you how happy I am that I have taken up drawing again. I had been thinking about it for a long time, but always considered it impossible & beyond my abilities. But now, though I continue to be conscious of my failings & of my depressing dependence on a great many things, now I have recovered my peace of mind & my energy increases by the day"" ""Many times when I have walked the streets all alone with time hanging heavily on my hands"" ""It is so quiet and peaceful here in the studio right now- it is already late- but it is stormy and rainy outside- and that makes the calm inside even greater"" ""I want to get to the point where people say of my work: that man feels deeply, that man feels keenly. In spite of my so-called coarseness"" ""What am I in the eyes of most people- a nonetity or an eccentric or an unpleasant person- somebody who has no position in society and never will have, in short the lowest of the low. Alright, then- even if that were all absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love malgré tout (in spite of everything), based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum"" ""Because I now have such a broad, such an expansive feeling for art and for life itself, of which art is the essence"" ""I don't know myself how I paint it, I just sit down with a white board in front of the spot that appeals to me, I look at what is in front of my eyes, and I say to myself: that white board has got to turn into something- I come back, dissatisfied, I lay it to one side and when I have rested a bit, I go and look at it with a kind of awe. Then I am still dissatisfied, because I have that splendid scenery too much in mind to be satisfied. Yet I can see in my work an echo of what appealed to me, I can see that the scenery has told me something, has spoken to me and that I have taken it down in shorthand"" ""So, for the one, a certain position or affluence, and a dealer. For the other, a degree of poverty and exclusion, and a painter"" ""Just slap anything on when you see a blank canvas staring at you like some imbecile. You don't know how paralysing that is, that stare of a blank canvas, which says to a painter: you can't do a thing. The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell if 'you can't' once and for all. Life itself, too, us forever turning an infinitely vacant, disheartening, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily. He wades in and does something and stays with it, in short, he violates, 'defiles'- they say. Let them talk, those cold theologians"" ""I also believe that if one aims for serenity, and retains one’s zest for living, one’s state of mind helps a great deal” “My father was strict, and attached to all sorts of conventions of which my brother never took any particular notice; needless to say, that often led to clashes and to words spoken in anger, which neither party was quick to forget. So during the past eight years Vincent has been a bone of contention with many, and all too often 9ne tended to forget all the good there was in him, the appearances to the contrary” letter by his sister, Wil “Anyway, it’s not a bad idea for you to become an artist, for when one has fire within and a soul, one cannot keep bottling them up- better to burn than to burst, what is in will out. For me, for instance, it’s a relief to do a painting, and without that I should be unhappier than I am” “When he came here two years ago, I did not think we would grow so attached to each other, for I certainly feel an emptiness now that I am alone in the apartment once again. If I can find somebody, then I shall take him in, but someone like Vincent is not easy to replace” Theo “after the period of melancholy is over you will be stronger than before, you will recover your health, and you will find the scenery around you so beautiful” ""I realize that life carries us along so fast that we haven't the time to talk and to work as well. That is the reason why, with unity still a long way off, we are now sailing the trackless deep in our frail little boats, all alone on the high seas of our time"" ""They say- and I am very willing to believe it- that it is difficult to know oneself- but it isn't easy to paint oneself either... look after yourselves, both of you. This confounded life in the art world is exhausting, it seems"" ""Well, do you know what I hope for, once I allow myself to begin to hope? It is that the family will be for you what nature, the clods of earth, the yellow wheat, the peasant, are for me, in other words, that you find in your love for people something not only to work for, but to comfort and restore you when there is a need. So, I beg you not let yourself get too exhausted by business, but to take good care pf yourselves, both of you- perhaps there will still be some good in the not too distant future"" ""I ask you once more, shouting at the top of my voice: please try to be yourself again!"""

If you've ever been tempted to bronze your subjective aesthetic and mount it in the museum between philosophy and science, this will be there to remind you how nearly impossible it is to pull off. Kandinsky couldn't do it and neither can you. I mean he sets forth to launch a theory of color analogized to harmonics, but what really comes through is an abiding disdain for yellow, coupled with a love letter to blue. His statement of artistic intent- you gotta pat him on the back for that idealistic ""whoosh""- appears equally specious. It's not that he's lying. It's just that his sleight of hand skills are pretty amateur so the part where he goes ""oh so my plan includes this, this, and that, from this day forward"" comes across pretty nakedly as a review of past and current work. It reminds me of having to write artist statements. These are a bitch, which is my thoroughly unscientific perspective. They are a bitch because they are more often than not worded as a request for a statement of artistic intent. Last I checked, ""I'm going to pick up this brush and paint until I get lost, and paint some more until I come out the other side. Motherfucker."" rarely cuts it. Because that doesn't really translate into anything but maximum snark - it's sort of like getting spattered with paint for asking ""what are you doing?"" The thing is, that statement is absolutely honest, it just doesn't make sense in any language outside the living craft of painting, and so to write a statement, I have to open the door to that compact structure of dream logic, walk outside, and look in the window and describe what I see. This, however, is not the same thing as writing a grocery list, even if it's written on paper covered with vegetables, as a bullet-list. All I can do is write what I see. I can't predict where process will take me, the most I can do is make preparatory drawings as points of departure. Maybe Kandinsky was a precog. His enthusiasm for the path away from representation, for the synthesis of the arts, for advances of the spirit through science likely conflated observable trends in his existing body of work with future intent. And it's not just a little heart-breaking (but funny, always funny) to encounter his One True Quest towards pure expression conveyed upon such muddy waters."
Concerning the Spiritual in Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Theory is the lamp which sheds light on the petrified ideas of yesterday and of the more distant past. The first time I saw a painting by Kandinsky was in the Guggenheim Museum. Back then, I really didn’t have much appreciation for visual art, least of all abstract paintings. Nevertheless, I remember being intrigued, and finally fascinated by his work. The way he was able to select forms reminiscent of, but not dependent on, real-life objects delighted my eye. Later, I saw a special exhibition of Kandinsky’s work in Madrid. It was divided by place and time, taking me through his Russian, German, and Parisian period, during which he moved from representative art to complete abstraction. I came away from that exhibit with my interest in Kandinsky re-confirmed, and now I can say that he is one of my favorite 20th century artists. is a short book (more like an extended essay) by Kandinsky, detailing his personal philosophy of art. For Kandinsky, the artist is like a prophet, able to see farther, think more deeply, and feel more keenly than ordinary people. The great artist’s function is to satisfy the cravings of the spirit. In music this is done through rhythm and melody; in painting through color and form. The spiritual function of art has been hampered by what Kandinsky calls materialism—representative art. The accurate reproduction of an object’s appearance is pointless in itself; what matters is its truth to the inner, not the outer, reality. Then follows a long chapter on Kandinsky’s theory of colors—which colors evoke which emotions, and their relationship to one another. As a work of theory, Kandinsky’s book is somewhat disappointing. It is more of a manifesto than a treatise—a simple declaration of Kandinsky’s opinions. As such, it is more interesting as a look into the mind of a great artist than as a piece of art theory. Kandinsky’s discussion of colors and shapes, for example, is silly as analysis, but fascinating as a peek into Kandinsky’s brain. Triangles, circles, squares; reds, yellows, blues—all these were like characters for Kandinsky, with their own personalities and temperaments. It was a pleasure to get to know him better."
Concerning the Spiritual in Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"To me, Kandinsky is the Kandinsky from the Bauhaus period, when his paintings were dominated by abstract compositions comprising lines, circles, triangles, and bold colours. Though Concerning the Spiritual in Art was written some ten years prior, the book may as well be about the explorations in artworks such as these. Part I of the book has one memorable idea: Kandinsky depicts the life of the spirit as a triangle, forever moving gently upwards, or rather, forever upwards by artists—the misunderstood souls—who forge the way for the rest of us. Part II of the book takes up the principles of painting; specifically, the psychic effect of forms and colours. The former can stand on their own, but the latter are meaningless without boundaries and contrasting shades. To Kandinsky two main division of colour are immediate: into yellow (pulsating, expanding) and blue (cool, withdrawing); and into white (peace pregnant with possibility) and black (profound, deathly pause). Other colours are considered too, and described with pithy statements. Much of the book is spent on drawing parallels between music and colour-form: Kandinsky wishes to compose on a painting. The parallels were thought-provoking. I could not ask more of book on colour theory: for we can only forge a path ahead by illuminating the past, learning from it, then building upon it."

Truly appreciating art always seemed like the province of finer souls. A secret protected on par with gypsy divination and Shamrock shakes. I guess I always thought art was beyond words. Kandinsky, in his brief book, proves otherwise. Incredibly lucid and articulate, Kandinsky leads the reader to move past an intellectual appreciation of art: With academic discipline, he explains the effects of color and form on the very non-academic soul. He effectively evokes the spiritual response to color through metaphor. It would be easy for Kandinsky to hide behind vague explanations to increase the sense of profundity in abstract art. But he doesn’t. He maps out the themes of abstraction concisely. All in an effort to go beyond meaning and aesthetic. His goal is to attune the soul to the effect of color. It’s all quite sincere and inspiring."

Concerning the Spiritual in Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In some ways I enjoyed the two rather lengthy introductions to the book (not by Kandinsky himself) -- which put his career and ideas in a historical perspective -- more than the book itself. I read the following review from an Amazon reader. I agree with most of it, and he brings out some of the more important points Kandinsky offers in his book. I especially like this insight from the reviewer: ""His spirituality is not an incarnational one, where the Spirit interpenetrates and quickens matter, but a dualistic one, where they can be separated or ""abstracted"". His purpose is laudable. It is to reveal the spiritual and make it visible anew ""towards the close of our already dying epoch"" (p. 47). But the problem is that he seeks to do this by abstraction, separation."" Here is the full review (w/ a few parts omitted): Kandinsky, who was one of the founders of modern art, sets out to confront the crass materialism of his era and the trite art that it was producing. He understands ""spirituality"" as being the interiority of things, their inner source of meaning and life. He attacks artistic narcissism, saying, ""This neglect of inner meanings, which is the life of colours, this vain squandering of artistic power is called 'art for art's sake'."" (p. 3). Consistent with his Russian Orthodox background, Kandinsky says, ""We are seeking today for the road which is to lead us away from the outer to the inner basis. The spirit, like the body, can be strengthened and developed by frequent exercise. Just as the body, if neglected, grows weaker and finally impotent, so the spirit perishes if untended. And for this reason it is necessary for the artist to know the starting point for the exercise of his spirit. The starting point is the study of colour and its effects on men."" (pp. 35-6). And I love his honesty in a footnote where he says, of his colour schema, ""These statements have no scientific basis, but are founded purely on spiritual experience."" (p. 37). If only we saw more awareness in the world of the importance of not confusing categories of thought between scientific evidence and artistic perception. To Kandinsky, Art's function is to reveal the spiritual. It ""must learn from music that every harmony and every discord which springs from the inner spirit is beautiful, but that it is essential that they spring from the inner spirit and from that alone."" (p. 51). This has a social function, for ""each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated"". (p. 1) As such, ""Painting is an art, and art is not vague production, transitory and isolated, but a power which must be directed to the improvement and refinement of the human soul."" (p. 54). Ultimately, ""If the artist be priest of beauty"", then she has ""a triple responsibility to the non-artist: (1) He must repay the talent which he has; (2) his deeds, feelings, and thoughts, as those of every man, create a spiritual atmosphere which is either pure or poisonous. (3) These deeds and thoughts are materials for his creations, which themselves exercise influence on the spiritual atmosphere. The artist is not only as king, as Peladan says, because he has great power, but also because he has great duties."" (pp. 54-55). And the bottom line? ""That is beautiful which is produced by the inner need, which springs from the soul."" He concludes: ""this property of the soul is the oil which facilitates the slow, scarcely visible but irresistable movement of [the human condition] onwards and upwards."" As will be apparent, this sense of spiritual progress may be modern thinking, but it is decidedly not postmodern. How strange, then, that Kandkindy is seen as a progenitor of ""modern"" art and its seamless, to my eye, drift into the incohate abstractions of postmodernity. It is here that my criticism of Kandinsky takes effect. Kandinsky's mindset is, at the same time, premodern in its perception of the spiritual essence, but postmodern deconstructive in its artistic articulation. His spirituality is not an incarnational one, where the Spirit interpenetrates and quickens matter, but a dualistic one, where they can be separated or ""abstracted"". His purpose is laudable. It is to reveal the spiritual and make it visible anew ""towards the close of our already dying epoch"" (p. 47). But the problem is that he seeks to do this by abstraction, separation. This takes us into a world that predicates the transcendent, but implicitly denigrates the immanent. Thus, ""The more abstract is form, the more clear and direct its appeal. In any composition the material side may be more or less omitted in proportion as the forms used are more or less material, and for them substituted pure abstractions, or largely dematerialised objects. The more an artist uses these abstracted forms, the deeper and more confidently will he advance into the kingdom of the abstract."" (p.32). And for Kandinsky such abstraction becomes a crusading obsession: ""Taking the work of Henri Rousseau as a starting point, I go on to prove that the new naturalism will not only be equivalent to but even identical with abstraction."" (p. 52). In his wonderful Introduction to the text, Michael Sadler suggests that this extreme abandonment of representation of the real world is why, ""The question most generally asked about Kandinsky's art is: 'What is he trying to do?'"" Saddler suggests, ""this book will do something towards answering the question. But it will not do everything."" (p. xviii). In contrast, he says, Cezanne ""saw in a tree, a heap of apples, a human face, a group of bathing men or women, something more abiding than either photography or impressionist painting could present. He painted the 'treeness' of the tree.... But in everything he did he showed the architectural mind of the true Frenchman. His landscape studies were based on a profound sense of the structure of rocks and hills, and being structural, his art depends on reality.... The material of which his art was composed was drawn from the huge stores of actual nature."" (p.xvii). Where does all this leave us today, in 2010, 99 years after first publication of Kandinsky's little book in German? When I look at the nihilism of Britart, or the sheer inability to draw and express beauty in what seems to be coming out of some of our contemporary art schools (the students tell me they are discouraged by their tutors from trying to express beauty!), then it is clear that abstraction has gone too far. Like postmodern deconstruction generally, it is all very well to deconstruct, but what about the grace of reconstruction? Kandinsky's aim to reveal the spiritual was laudable. That is the true meaning of the word ""apocalypse"" - to unveil and reveal that which has been hidden. But abstraction on its own and as the highest ideal is like pulling up a plant to see how the roots are growing. It causes disincarnation, which is another word for death, and so both the material and the spiritual wither. The art that we need for these our troubled times needs to be an apocalyptic art of incarnation. It needs to reveal the spiritual, but not separate it off from the material world. This will be a new art of the sacred. And here is where we need a debate to start, and artistic action around that debate. A resource that I would suggest is a book by the theologian Walter Wink, Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination - especially the Introduction on pp. 3 - 10. Wink argues that we must reject the dualistic idea of Heaven being separate from Earth. We need what he calls an ""integral worldview"", what is also sometimes called an incarnational spirituality. Here Heaven and Earth are interfused in a single reality (Christians can read Luke 17:20-21; Hindus the Bhagavad Gita; Taoists the Tao te Ching, etc.). And we need art, in the full artistic and theological senses of these words, to ""magnify"" and ""illuminate"" what incarnational spirituality looks like. To open the mind and the heart, and give fresh hope to the world. Sadler's remarks on Cezanne are a pointer in this direction. Kandinsky's little book provides a crucial intellectual stepping stone. We have lived through a century of dying and dead ""modern"" art. We cannot go on like that. It is time to call back the soul."

In it, the artist explains his plans for the ascent of spiritually fulfilling and expressive art that surpasses mere replication of natural form. This is not to say that Kandinsky is in favor of pure abstraction. He faults cubism as too intellectual and spiritually lacking, as opposed to inspired abstractions. I most enjoyed his breakdown of color theory, setting antitheses of white and black (obvi), yellow and blue, orange and purple, and green and red. There are even diagrams. As someone who grew up with the color wheel (also diagramed in the book), it was interesting that he deviated from the complementary/contrasting colors that are directly across from each other on the wheel, the creating an antithesis of yellow and blue, two primary colors. That's not to say that he doesn't also go into simple composition and form versus complex. And of course, there are the comparisons to music that are to be expected of a painter, and probable synesthete, who gave his works titles like ""Composition"" and ""Improvisation"" and ""Symphony"". In any case, he makes a clear, personal case against the popular ""art pour l'art"", not because he has an especial dislike of it, but because he imagines a greater, more satisfying art to come. This book isn't quite as satisfying as one of Kandinsky's paintings, but I did enjoy it."

A Baha'i pamphlet with that title was published in the 1970's. Being an activist artist in that revolution now is as important as ever."

(taken out from the book itself) If we read Kandinsky's work with these words in mind, it is much easier to understand his arguments and hypotheses. Kandinsky has a lot of interesting ideas regarding form and color and mostly the relationship between music and painting. It is the second book I read that has whole paragraphs about the comparison between these two arts, (First one being Arnheim's ) which definitely proves Kandinsky's point that in order to understand painting fully and to be immersed in it, you need knowledge of other arts, complementary ones (like music and dance). 3/5 because he absolutely uses words and sentence structures as in to confuse the reader sometimes or to just weed out the readers that won't look over his way of writing. It looks rather snobbish. However, I did find a lot of ideas that resonated with me. Loved the second chapter ""About Painting"" and mostly the parts about ""the psychological working of color"" and ""the language of form and color"". Also, I'm very happy I got to read a version of the book with endnotes and from now on I will be certainly using ""feeling very violet as an expression"". :)"

(how was that for poetic irony) he has a chapter called the movement of the triangle, in which he forms a triangle based upon levels of spiritual growth. what is it with metaphysical writers that makes them use obscure geometric charts to illustrate an idea. see ken wilbur if you are not sure what i mean. the chapter wraps up nicely and he makes some very clear points, but the beginning is very slow going and clogged with imagery too complex for his simple implication. he seems to focus on the art that is not spiritual, trying to show by absence the art that is. he sites many styles and trends in art at the time that seem to portray stillborn representations of human life. art, in his and my eye, is to relate the human condition to the future generations that they may understand where we lived. this book is just shy of one hundred years old, and still it is valid in modern conversation. where wassily had impressionists, we have pop, where he had vase on table with fruit, we have a fucking dead tiger shark in formaldehyde. does the art of today really reflect our universal subconscious. will a fifty million dollar, diamond encrusted skull save the soul of anyone tomorrow, or today for that matter, and still this is what we know as our contemporaries. sure we have our jenny savilles,who is a mind staggering painter, and let us not overlook them, god forbid we let another van gogh slip away. but the damien hirsts are killing me. now, just today i hear about marla olmstead, the four year old abstract expressionist prodigy, whose work is compared to pollock, and dekooning. marla is all the buzz right now. a four year old whose father is paints, has the spotlight as genius of painting. is this art? is it commodity? nit sch? what do i know. i do know some of the stuff of hers is very cool, and most likely, if seen by unwitting eyes, would be hailed as great work by one who truly suffered and now understands life with color. not sure what i think about that, just an interesting topic right now. what would wassily say? i am sure a part of him would see the beauty and innocence and then the spiritual side of her pictures. but the purist in him would denounce her ""work"" as simply the play thing of a child, which it is. all in all, the book really is refreshing in that is a statement of sincerity about art. it is rare that we read a book about art theory that as actually written by an artist. most are like parenting books written by childless doctors. this, however is the real deal. kandinsky is one of the most famous artists of the 20th century, also one of the most prolific writers on art. the book is not finely tuned, but it's rawness is it's energy. note kandisnky's influence on contemporaries such as chuck close, who is famed for super-realism, or photo-realism, which completely disembarks from the course set by kandinsky himself. oh the ways we dig our graves and how we praise the soil!"

There are some universalities about them. This book describes how an artist often approaches colors and forms. I do admire the forward looking enthusiasm of Kandinsky, but I get so weary of formulas of the Great Future, which can be co-opted to something malevolent, and sets up boundaries for all other art. Kandinsky's work was too wonderful for the Nazi's to use it for their limited view of art. Instead it was showed in the degenerative art show and destroyed, I do believe, if not in actual existence, that there is the effect of our existence, that if nothing else, it gives us an experience of spirit, or soul. This meeting of the spirits, then, is one way of approaching art. Of course, then there is intention and the concept(as in Kandinsky's composition definition), and all that. Kandinsky saw, that the best art comes from the inner need of the artist. Inner spiritual need. Then again, which artist starts doing art reluctantly in the first place? This book was written in 1919. Kandinsky complains about materialism. It made me laugh-in desperation, I guess. As he writes, art must be free. I agree, that's why I find his theory at times too narrow. The art has branched since then to camp, pop, ironic, post-modern and who knows what. Thus maybe the title should be: Concerning the Spirituality in MY Art."

Kind of dense and not smoothbrain friendly in some parts; I found his triangle analogy very difficult to follow. However, what i DID end up taking away from this was wholly worth the read in entirety. I enjoy his impassioned take on the social duties of the artist to others, alongside his cry for comprehensible art. The former traces sentiments I’ve found in the camp of James Baldwin (The Artists Struggle for Integrity), Robert Schumann (THAT quote), and Mary Oliver (Wild Geese) as far as the idea that artists, by virtue of being one, are automatically bestowed a form of leadership, they owe to the masses a means of alleviating their suffering. The latter makes me think of Frantz Fanon in the Wretched of the Earth where he asserts it is imperative for the intellectuals/artists in a revolutionary effort to connect with the masses in a manner that is comprehensible and grounded. Though Kandinsky isn’t speaking to the same effort, their approach to the common idea of liberation whether that be spiritual, decolonial, or otherwise was cool and stood out to me. Other points I thought were interesting: Artists should make art that responds to what he calls the “inner need”; As well as the importance, or lack thereof, of style and personality in art. So the meat and potatoes. Reading this wholly changed my perception on the use of color in art when viewing making as a spiritual practice. I enjoyed taking in his understanding and construction of each color, its movement, its impression, its function. I even did an activity with oil pastels, observing the colors in relation to his philosophy of them—highly recommended! Whether I see the spiritual properties of colors as defined by Kandinsky now because reading it made it the rule in my impressionable head, or it's something that always existed and I am just becoming attuned to is still cause for debate. Regardless, im still digesting and I’m enjoying viewing my practice through this lens, and I’m looking forward to revisiting his work with this context in mind!"
Concerning the Spiritual in Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Inner Life Though Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art it is a well known text, often talked about in art school circles, it is, in reality, all too rarely read in class. This begs the question, should it be viewed or understood as essential reading? And, if so, what is it actually trying to do? To begin, read the translator's introduction in the dover edition. It is well worth your time and it does a great job of summarily explaining the historical context of the work and its intent. As for the book itself, divided into nine parts, it is an artist's attempts to explore the means and methods of expressing one's inner life in art. Do not be misled into assuming it is purely about mark making. It is about expression. It is in no way 'simply' concerned with the painterly or the materialist aspects or even the physical appearance of art. Throughout the text, Kandinsky seeks to decompress the 'Arts/Aesthetic's' ability to impart various impressions and sensations onto its viewers. In the translator's introduction, Kandinsky is quoted as saying: 'the relationships in art are not necessarily ones of outward form, but are founded on inner sympathy of meaning'. He continues, 'Simplicity... is the trademark of the true Post-Impressionist. He observes and then selects what is essential'. Combined, these two quotations are the core of what is to follow. Kandinsky holds these views as self-evident and consequently explores, without necessarily summarizing, the human & spiritual potential of art. He feels, we as humans, are in need of a call to arms. That we have lost our way in the art making process. That, we (artists), have been led astray in our search for and focus on material things and thus alienated our audiences. As a consequence, rather than making them feel, we hope they understand 'what we are trying to do or achieve'. Rather than attempt and capture a personal Truth, we create systems and patterns that obfuscate. Kandinsky then clarifies. He makes a connection to the 'primitive' artists, stating: 'these artists sought to express in their work only internal truths, renouncing in consequence all consideration of external form'(1). What does this actually mean? Consider the sensations you are bound to feel watching Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. The sense of awe doesn't come from the technical aspects of the cave paintings but rather an essential, almost indescribable, feeling of 'True Essence' being captured... Kandinsky would have loved the work and surely noted the near otherworldly, yet earthly sensations they create. The internal truth captured on these various walls is the artisan or artist's ability to express a reality in a 'filtered' but 'pure' way. Yes these are simplified forms. Yes they are rather disproportionate in scale and yet....there is a bridging of sorts between representation and understanding. A trust in the spectator. A belief that shape, colour and form is a means to an end rather than The End of means Kandinsky continues: ''What is the message of the competent artist? He quotes Schumann:''To send light into the darkness of men's hearts-such is the duty of the artist'' (3). He quotes Tolstoi: ''An artist is a man who can draw and paint everything'(3)...Given our current state of political unrest, race riots, global warming, is this call to arms any less relevant than it was years ago? He continues: 'the man who does not strive tirelessly, who does not fight continually against sinking, will mentally and morally go under' (7)... Now think of the menial jobs and social roles current 'bottom line' business thinking imparts on the vase majority of its employees. Think of these repetitive factory jobs, the ones William Morris warned us of years ago. The ones that no longer inherently reward the worker's hands with a finished product. Those Henry Ford Codified-Factory line jobs where no sense of ownership or pride can ever exist...Where efficiency is the necessity... Where consistency is key... Where man is made machine. Kandinsky's answer: 'The question ''what?'' disappears from art; only the question ''how?'' remains... art has lost her soul'' (8) But how so? Kandinsky proposes 'that the most extreme principle of aesthetic can never be of value to the future, but only to the past' (12)...That 'Theory is the lamp which sheds light on the petrified ideas of yesterday and of the more distant past' (12). Bogged down by the serious financial possibilities of art, artists are accused of seeking 'in house' glory rather intimate connection... This reflects on the rare individual whose plight is to capture the soul. He marks 'the dark picture of the present time and show(s) the importance of what at first was only a little point of light noticed by few and for the great majority non-existent...[To those who] turn away from the soulless life of the present towards those substances and ideas which give free scope to the non-material strivings of the soul.'' (14)... In essence, art must seek to express what can be felt in nature but not necessarily seen. What can be transmitted but does not necessarily exist... He expands: 'On the average man only the impressions caused by very familiar objects, will be purely superficial...As the man develops, the circle of these experiences caused by different being and objects, grows ever wider. they acquire an inner meaning and eventually a spiritual harmony. It is the same with colour, which makes only a momentary and superficial impression on a soul but slightly developed in sensitiveness.' (23-24) He goes on to explain colours have a 'psychic effect' (24) which produce a 'spiritual vibration' (24). Take that as you may but try and stare are Newman's Voice of Fire in order to get 'The soul being one with the body, the former may well experience a psychic shock' (24). Essentially all project and make an impression. Accepting this, He suggests 'Painting has two weapons at her disposal: 1. Colour 2. Form' (28) First, 'Form can stand alone as representing an object (either real or otherwise) or as a purely abstract limit to a space or a surface.' (28). Secondly, Colour cannot stand alone; it cannot dispense with boundaries of some kind.' (28). He then clarifies that: 'Form, in the narrow sense, is nothing but the separating line between surfaces of colour' (29). And so it goes.... I will add to this later 'There is no must in art because art is free' (32) Why? Why try and imitate? Why try to capture physical truths when we can attempt to express a core, an inner truth?"

Artists have a spiritual impulse to create and audiences, when correctly recognized, have a spiritual hunger to fill. Wassily Kandinsky is the artist we will study as a family for the month of January and I am very much looking forward to learning more about his desire to dispel the decision the general public makes when reducing art, music, and religion to technique and skill. ""In each picture is a whole lifetime imprisoned, a whole lifetime of fears, doubts, hopes, and joys. Whither is this lifetime tending? What is the message of the competent artist? … To harmonize the whole is the task of art."" Kandinsky believed the inner need of an artist is a build up of three elements: (1) Every artist, as a creator, has something in him which calls for expression (this is the element of personality) (2) Every artist, as child of his age, is impelled to express the spirit of his age (this is the element of style)--dictated by the period and particular country to which the artist belongs (it is doubtful how long the latter distinction will continue to exist). (3) Every artist, as a servant of art, has to help the cause of art (this is the element of pure artistry, which is constant in all ages and among all nationalities)."

Nazis marked him as degenerate, nevertheless a pioneer in abstract painting. His theory of painting is an excellent addition to Aristotelian Organon's book (categories) and, by extension, to Platonic Forms theory. He talks about art forms, and he categorizes them according to musical terminology, most of them at least. I loved chapters 5 and 6, the Psychological working of Colour and the language, form, and colour. If you ever find this book, stop at those chapters and enjoy the best description of how colours affect our souls. Perhaps that is why this book is considered a classic. One note that got me interested is that is known for over 100 years now that blue colour can cause paralysis. So if we talk about the blue screen of death on our PCs, remember Wassily as he said about the danger of staring at too much blue colour in paintings in the early 1900s."

In writing these books they remove the barriers over which art has most recently stepped and set up new ones which are to remain for ever in the places they have chosen. They do not notice that they are busy erecting barriers not in front of art, but behind it. And if they do notice this, on the morrow they merely write fresh books and hastily set barriers a little further on.

It's necessary to approach the book from the understanding that the entire concept of ""abstract art"" did not yet exist at the time of its writing. So his notion that art must be based on an inner spiritual feeling rather than the outer world was quite radical. But beyond that I've failed to decipher his messages. This was his first book, written I think in 1910 or '11. The second one, Point and Line to Plane is said to be more informative, but I read that one previously and discerned even less from it. In neither book did I find any hints about decoding the phantasmagorical imagery in his art, which was my quest in the first place. I read three other full-length books about Kandinsky as wall, and still didn't uncover anything. Maybe no one other than the artist himself knew and he wasn't telling."

That being said, the descriptions of his use of color were beautiful and made for good discussion. It brought up a lot of ideas about how we see art. He discussed what type of sensations different colors bring up. When it came down to it though, he admitted that perceiving art comes from the complex interactions of a potentially large amount of inputs. Kadinsky argues that keeping the number of inputs small, by using simple colors and forms, restricts the amount of preconceived notions, symbols, and references that are going to fly into the audience's mind. This allows the artist to pull the 'it' / basic principle / idea of the peice to shine through unobstructed."

In On the Spiritual in Art, Kandinsky explores not only his views of spirituality in art, but also how both music and art were changing. Kandinsky makes clear and compelling observations of the work of impressionist painters including the work of Cezanne and Picasso. Kandinsky theorized how color, composition, and even music and dance effected the brain. This was far ahead of what FMRI would discover more than a century later. “The dance of the future, which is placed on one level with present day's music and painting, then attains the ability to create stage composition as a third element, becoming the first creation of the monumental art. The stage composition will consist of the following three elements: 1. Musical movement 2. Pictorial movement 3. Artistic dance movement Kandinsky had what appears high regard for the work of Debussy, the spiritual in music and nature , a soothing for “suffering souls and shaken nerves” : “The foremost modern composers, such as Debussy, present spiritual impressions which they often derive from nature, and which they refine into spiritual visions by purely musical means. For this reason, Debussy is often compared to the impressionistic painters, who, also, use impressions of nature's phenomena In their art. The truth, contained in this statement. Is another proof of the fact that the various art expressions of today seem to learn from each other, and often resemble each other in their aims. It would, however, be rash to say that the above-mentioned definition is an exhaustive statement of Debussy's significance.” On the Spiritual in Art, written in 1910. “Despite his similarity to the impressionists, the urge of this musician for Inner spiritual harmony is so strong that in his work one hears immediately the suffering soul and shaken nerves of our present-day with all its sufferings. Debussy never uses the entire materialistic note, so characteristic program music, but restricts himself to the utilization of the spiritual value in the appearances.” -Kandinsky 1910 These just a few of the analytical themes that run throughout the book. The book a very interesting read that at very least could provide good anecdotal lessons for young children with early exposure to music, dance and movement, and to young artists and musicians or even young adults studying theater arts. For those interested in good art theory material, I am including a link to what appears to be a free PDF of the book:"

Reading this book after the election of Donald Trump, it seems poignant that Kandinsky ever imagined that the world was going to get better. He thought we were about to wake up from the dream of materialism. He thought apocalypse would bring new life, utopia. He didn’t imagine the world would be uninhabitable by the time we got done with it. He speaks so confidently of Science -- he didn’t imagine we’d decide to totally ignore Science, once it got in the way of profit and comfort. This is a lovely small book. And it hurts a little to read it now. Quoting Madame Blavatsky, that great innovator of spiritual humbug, he says, “The earth will be a heaven in the twenty-first century in comparison to what it is now”. It is a small miracle that a book founded on optimism and Blavatsky is still interesting, helpful, valuable. It IS possible to make a silk purse from a sow’s ear, at least if you are a great artist. Even if you don’t have the luxury of believing in his conclusions, this book is still a tonic, useful in dark times. (Side note: understanding Kandinsky, the New Age, and many different fascinating varieties of American nonsense is greatly facilitated by reading ‘Madame Blavatsky’s Baboon’, a lively history of spiritualism in America, replete with misfits and mayhem.) The heart of this small book is the chapter “The Language of Form and Color”, in which Kandinsky describes the properties of all the colors. Whether or not you agree with his pronouncements, it is enlivening to think alongside him and beautiful to read. For example: “Yellow is a typical earthly color. It can never have profound meaning. An intermixture of blue makes it a sickly color. It may be paralleled in human nature, with madness, not with melancholy or hypochondriacal mania, but rather with a violent raving lunacy.” Or: “Violet is therefore both in the physical and spiritual sense a cooled red. It is consequently rather sad and ailing. It is worn by old women, and in China as a sign of mourning. In music it is an English horn, or the deep notes of wood instruments (e.g. a bassoon).” If you intend to purchase this book, keep in mind that it is in the public domain. The Dover edition sells perennially, yet they haven’t seen fit to retype it in the last 100 years. Brace yourself for wobbly and spiderish typefaces. The Dover edition is illustrated, but poorly reproduced. You’re better off looking up the masterpieces online."
Concerning the Spiritual in Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"All of Kandinky’s opinions of art/the artist may be boiled down to the following: 1. Art, namely painting and music are interrelated, children of a particular age, and created by the “mysterious and secret way” by the artist (53). “There is no ‘must’ in art, because art is free”(32). 2. The more abstract art tends to become, the more reflective and representative of the “inner life” or spiritual nature of humanity because as naturalism/realism is shed (not necessarily form since form in Cubism is reflective of a distorted version of reality that bears meaning), the inner associations—or eternal truth, he couldn’t decide which really—begins to shine forth (e.g. see the “psychic effect” of colors on pg. 24). 3. “We must find...a form of expression which excludes [a narrative] and yet does not restrict the free working of colour in any way...The more obvious is the separation from nature, the more likely is the inner meaning to be pure and unhampered”(50). Therefore, the further from approximating a realistic portrayal of natural objects in painting we are, the closer to conveying the inner workings of our spiritual core we are...(This, by the way, HAS to be his best justification for his deepened love for the abstract and his ridiculous red circle paintings...they’re not dumb, they’re inspired from his intense spiritual experience with RED!) 4. Artists must “have something to say...He must not love idle...He must realize that his every deed, feeling, and thought are raw but sure material from which his work is to arise, that he is free in art but not in life”(54). (This is the penultimate vocation of the artist for Kandinsky and one I find fascinating.) Perhaps because creating art is a spiritual experience for the artist and I am not an artist experiencing the inner workings of my soul via a particular medium, I could not relate to this book. I found it to be very ethnocentric, culture-bound, opinionated, and abysmally abstract. Don’t you know that “everyone knows that yellow...suggests ideas of joy and plenty” and Egyptian carving speaks more to us today than even their sculptors (27;34)?! What Kandinsky wanted to say, he could have boiled down into 10 pages instead of rambling on about the color Red, some ridiculous analogy of the Pyramid, and prophesying about the future of art being one of spiritual awakening. I find this last conclusion to be ironic since much of post-modern art is gimmick, cliche, and shock-performance all rolled into one. We couldn’t be farther from his expectations."

For that reason few mortal souls withstand the leadership of a soul which gives to them beauty.'"" This quote is taken from the tail end of Wassily Kandinsky's ground-breaking, thought-provoking, and stimulating treatise on what was, in 1914, when it was first published, cutting edge meditations on the new art. In this short but comprehensive read, Kandinsky takes a page from his predecessor Walter Pater, who famously said that all art aspires to the condition of music, the perfect marriage of form and content. In this book, this insight is directly applied to the form of painting, where colors are the medium which evoke resonances that ""vibrate the soul."" In fact, Kandinsky goes into great detail as to the nature of the effects of these colors, going so far as to give a diagram outlining the implications these colors have on the sensibility of the soul. To an artist these may be well-worn clichés, aged and less than insightful; but to this layman these insights were evocative and inspiring, like the colors they describe. For these colors sound the ""notes"" that painting plays, to the enjoyment and edification of the viewer. Moreover, the author includes prints of paintings that illustrate the ideas expounded in his text, which elucidate the tenets of his thought with clarity and conciseness. So, however well-worn and dated these ideas may be, I found them inspiring and insightful in the extreme, adding to my understanding of the project of early 20th century expressionist art and my appreciation of Kandinsky as a thinker and as an artist. So, in some way, Kandinsky, as Maeterlinck asserts, has given us the gift of beauty. This gift of universal value serves us all well as we make our way through a world debased by literalness and ugliness. An essential read, ""Concerning the Spiritual in Art"" offers insight and inspiration to its reader, a must for any important read."

So, why am I giving it 5 stars? I am an art historian, I didn't read this book to find it as truth or to consider it an actual part of reality, I read it as a way to understand both the artist and the movement he caused, to understand the thought processes and directions he was taking and that others would somehow follow in abstract art. The book fulfilled my need perfectly. As I read this extended essay by Kandinsky, and remembering the own lessons my university taught me, I found the ideologies constructed intriguing, a radical manifesto of what art should be for these artists. We start with the need to expose the inner meanings of each artist, the way art isn't a material practice anymore in which we can only show what is seen in the outside world, but a way to show the invisibility of the inner world. He also explain an interesting analogy between the evolution of art and a triangle, in which the top slowly become part of the bottom as a new top is defined. What I found most interesting and something that I hadn't heard before in classes is Kandinsky's constant comparison between the new spiritual art that is arising and music, the way music is the first branch of art that divided itself from the immediate material world and as such, the first branch of art which dwelt with showing the inner worlds of the artists. So yeah, as an art historian this was a good read, just don't take it too seriously and always question what you are being told, art is always changing along with humanity, nothing is set in stone on what is correct and what isn't."

Tracing the development of his art, so can the development of his ideas be seen to evolve. That he attempted to put into writing his artistic intentions takes some of the mystery from his process--and indeed, Kandinsky did not want his art to be a mystery. Uniting the viewer with the work of art was the artist's goal, and the artist was supposed to use a language (the spiritual language of the soul) to achieve it. It would be interesting to know how Kandinsky would explain his ideas today given our access to scientific studies and the vocabulary of psychology. What he called spiritual resonance seems to be what we would call psychological effect. And though renaming it somewhat sterilizes the idea, Kandinsky would have appreciated a scientific approach in order to gain greater certainty about color and forms effects on the ""soul."" Kandinsky's essay is not always easy, and without a firm footing in his time, the name-dropping could come perilously close to boring the reader (invocation of Madame Blavatsky also feels questionable, looking from the perspective of the future). However, we are fortunate that he was motivated and articulate enough to attempt to explain his working methods, both for his contemporaries as well as for future admirers of his art whose enjoyment of it is made more robust through having a view into his thoughts."

This short read describes the correct way to view, interpret, & ""feel"" abstract art. Kandinsky gently lulls the reader into interpreting abstract art work from their own subjectiveness, requesting that the viewer be open only to any & all spiritual vibrations that might be produced in your being. You feel art, not consume it. You give it meaning, instead of taking it prima facie. You associate the visual with the other senses & you begin to develop synesthesia. It was a truly deep & perception altering read. It's also rather short, Kandinsky wanted to get back to painting I suppose. Prior to reading this book & delving into surreal abstract art forms, I was a staunch representationist. I believed art ought to reflect real life. I viewed the work of surrealists to be gimmicky & obscurantism in practice. After reading this book in 2010, opened were my eyes to the stunning beauty of the surrealist. This book not only helped me cultivate a deep appreciation for abstract art, but it compelled me to seek out abstract forms of expression across all creative mediums. Kandinsky's writing gave me the appropriate mindset to tackle Dali's Andalousian dog, & then hurled me without objection towards Pollack & Fellini (Satyricon is a masterpiece). If you're the type of person who scoffs at the abstract art of modernity, give this a read. I'm sure you'll gain a new analytic framework to thoroughly digest & interpret any abstract, surreal media."

The book, which he claimed had been gestating for nearly a decade, elucidated his artistic theories and his valuing of expression and spirituality over naturalistic representation. It also introduced his new pictorial categories derived from the field of music—impressions, improvisations, and compositions—which further de-emphasized the importance of recognizable subject matter. On the cover and in ten woodcuts, Kandinsky illustrated his ideas by reducing complex scenes of spiritual battle and redemption to simplified designs of lines and shapes. For Kandinsky, abstraction was a weapon for transforming what he perceived to be a corrupt, materialist society. PUBLISHING HISTORY Despite Munich publisher Reinhard Piper's fears, Über das Geistige in der Kunst sold well, and it went through three editions between December 1911 and the end of 1912.

The structure is also quite clear: the first part is about the triangle theory of human spirit development, which serves the purpose of the author in his argument about abstract art. The second part introduces the color and form theory, which is also my favorite part of the two. For him, the inner spirit of the art, or the spiritual atmosphere an artist creates is more important than the material he uses. A real artist is good at expressing his or her inner spirit/thought/feelings through different forms and colors which dont have to be necessarily those natural forms or colors with which we are familiar, based on the theory explained in the 2nd chapter. I guess thats also the point of abstract art. It seems free in its form and color, but its colors have their own language, its forms bearing a certain theory. These rules are the basics for understanding abstract art/artists. There are many thought-provoking and inspiring points of view about art in this book, all of which I cant quote here. So if you are interested in such topics, you will certainly have that moment of ""aha"" and appreciate the idea of the author and wont be disappointed reading it."

Whether is this lifetime tending? What is the message of the competent artist? … To harmonize the whole is the task of art’’ Kandisnky is concerned about the purpose of art. He dwelves into the history of art from a realism based on nature towards impressionsim and finally blossoming into abstract art. That transistion is rooted on the fundamental concepts of color and form, creating a composition that speak lourder than purely realistic paintings. This in contrast to the general public's regard for art reduced to skills and technique. In short, think about realistic artwork you have seen online or in person. Did these highly technical and skilled photographic recreations leave an impression on your mind? Now think about painting that have left an impression on you? Sandisnky goes on to explain the color theory, form and their inherent emotions and effects they have on you. Ultimately it is critique of art for art's sake, and a searh for the inner meaning, or spirituality of art. The artist must strive to have something to say such that a mastery of technique or skill is not the goal, but rather that a mastery of one's soul expressed through color, form as art."

Uses his contemporaries as examples on specific points, but does't limit the call to arms for spiritual revolution to his particular place in art history. Just as interesting a work of religious writing as it is an essay on abstraction in art. Criticized for throwing convention out the window without offering sufficient definition of the new direction he seems to be talking about, but in retrospect I think that makes his philosophy more available to someone who reads it, say, 100 years later. The second section is pretty technical and specific to painting, but still interesting to see how he's rethinking form and color less as tools for representation and more as the vocabulary of a new kind of language."

In time the background is brought forward and fused into the foreground. He seeks a higher plain to effect the onlooker. His desire is to ""send light into the darkness of men's hearts"" quote by Schumann. It is not ""art for art's sake"". What drives one to create great art should not merely be academically skillful. An artist in NOT one who can draw and paint anything. One who seeks material reward for his dexterity, his power of vision and experience. This is all vanity and greed. Not only should art educate and mirror the here and now, but have a deep and powerful prophetic strength. Urging one forward and upward. Find the power on your inner nature that moves men and women. Discover the power on your inner vision and the spirituality of form and color."

Kandinsky discusses his orientation to natural versus symbolist artistic expression, the arc or society and the spirit of man, a system of spiritual salience related to color, analogies between art forms and sciences, and what he believes is involved in spiritual expression via visual representation in art. A somewhat self-centered take, but perhaps appropriately so (all examples of spiritual/non-objective art are his own, I recommend looking up Hilma af Klint if you like Kandinsky). I personally struggle with distinctions laid out in this orientation to art- is a piece of art non objective because it isn’t a depiction of physical objects, but is, for example, a representation of emotions or ideas?"

Most of the time, artist's leave their work unexplained and leave the viewer guessing the intentions of the artist. Kandinsky goes beyond articulating what his art is about: with rich description and poetical genius, he explains the musical qualities and the spiritual dimensions of art. Only an artist which as much insight and experience as Kandinsky can invision such innovative and beautiful theories. However, the greatest gift that he possess, is his willingness to put down the paint brush, pick up the pen and take his time to share his illuminating insights with the rest of us."

Kandinsky is one of artists who knows how to convey his art with words. His color discussion - yellow and blue - and genuine search for the 'inner guidance' in art, dismissing all the unnecessary actors and leaving it bare in its nature are nothing short of genius His way of thinking is revolutionary in its futurism, to say the least. He 'foresaw' coming of many types of arts without 'precise form', contemporary ballet, rave music and such as - shapes of art without exact form and therefore closer to the source and the soul of a listener To top it all, a great way of inspiring one's work by moving the conventional viewpoint onto the slightly leaned mirror of introspection while trying to find that genuine inner purity"

It has aligned so well with many of my understandings and answered so many questions. I expected much higher average rating on Goodreads.

Degenerate spirit creates degenerate expressions, and healthy expressions can change the world. Highly recommended."

Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I hate this book. Or more accurately, I hate what this book focuses on. Now I need to state that my hatred is pretty moronic. The book is titled Seven Days in the Art World, which very clearly labels it as a tourist's guidebook, so it might as well be labelled , or , or . It's , which is the length of time most tourists give to some ""foreign locale."" In seven days, you won't really experience the destination, but you will see the same ridiculous highlights fellow tourists from the U.S., Germany, Australia, and the UK have seen. What I hate is the tourist highlights she focuses on. It's similar to a guidebook to NYC that focuses on the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Statue of Liberty, etc. All interesting, I suppose, but really boring and obvious tourist attractions that capture nothing of the workaday quotidian NYC; the NYC that NYers experience. The world of tourists and the world of NYers rarely interacts, unless a fat-ass tourist is in a NYers way while they're walking to work. ""Hey, I'm heah!"" The art world is a . It's a group of people in constant communication, talking and sharing and part of a community. There are several worlds within the art world, and Thornton focuses only on Power Institutions. When she does focus on individuals, she focuses on the ""Big Names"" and ""Art Stars,"" which I know makes sense for a guide book, but really paints a false picture about the world the book is supposed to guide us through. As a tourist guide, it's hard to focus on the cool shit that is happening in some hidden neighborhood, where artists or musicians or dancers or whatever are making something interesting, but if you're guidebook is anything more than a schlocky checklist, then that is where the action is. She focuses on The Biggest Prize. The Most Influential Art Magazine. The Vastly Important Art Fair. And it's all bullshit. The value of art isn't created in The Auction, The Crit, The Fair, The Prize, The Magazine, The Studio Visit, or The Biennale. It happens in the day to day. It happens in the neighborhoods that those artists live in; in the worlds they inhabit. Institutions, blue chip galleries, the Biennials, etc., all come after the fact. And they come before the fact, then the art world is fucked and dysfunctional (e.g. the long, sad, and boring time periods when Academic Art reigned). Basically, this book implies that value filters down from the top, which isn't true. The author tries to temper that implication by stating, several times, that it is a very complicated dialog with many voices in the mix, but she leaves out the quotidian in favor of the sexy Big Events, which have everything to do with Money and Power, and very little to do with art. A personal note: I have a few friends who are now successful artists, gallerists, critics, and curators. And I know a bunch of people who dropped out of the art world altogether (me included). And a few people who putter on with the occasional show or as an art professor at some university. But I watched the successful ascend, and it did NOT happen in The Auction, The Crit, The Fair, The Prize, The Magazine, The Studio Visit, or The Biennale. It happened in two places: in the studio and in ""the social scenes that artists live in."" Most of the time, art is lonely. Until you're successful, you will work alone, or, at best, in a studio near a friend, who is also working alone. The time in a studio is insanely private, until you need assistants (which is another fucked-up topic entirely). But tons of time is spent with peers at each other's studios, getting high or drinking and looking at each other's work. Or more often, at a cafe or a bar, talking about process and gossiping and, ""Have you seen Person X's new work?"" The value of art accrues in the interstices, hidden away from the ""sexy"" power machines that Thorton covers in her book. The value of art happens as gossip between artists. And that talk flows to peers who are roughly the same age who have galleries or write for obscure web art publications. And that talk about who is good coalesces and congeals. And only after that gossipy talk has formed into blocks does it filter up to or a mid-list gallery, and only after years does that flow up to a spot at the Venice Biennale, or a prominent spot in a money gallery that can afford to go to Basel. This book is a snap shot of an art world that forgot (and continues to forget) that those massive Money and Cultural Institutions are barnacles on the vibrant ass of the art world. They, like the parasitical rich whose genitals are constantly slurped at, are after thoughts that claim glory, when the glory was already established. Yes, Art That Is Remembered will be remembered in part because of those boring Money and Cultural Institutions, but art that is good continues for centuries, long past the death of those institutions and rich people. More importantly, art is not accrued value through the barnacled institutions, but through the peer groups that the artists gestate in. And although that's a much harder world to guide someone through, that's the real world of the everyday, not the ridiculous world of the tourist looking at irrelevant relics to Power and Money."

She seems, overall, clueless about art. Her deep, probing interview questions are ""What do artists learn at art school? What is an artist? How do you become one? What makes a good one?"" Seriously. Granted, the less the reader knows about art, I imagine, the more interesting the book would be. She loves describing what people are wearing, as in, ""Gladstone is dressed entirely in black Prada."" Everything is written in a forced present-tense, as if that would make it visceral and exciting instead of pretentious and dull. She writes choppy paragraphs quoting her interview subjects. Either quote them, or give us your interpretation of what they said, but please do not do both at the same time. Even if Thornton is showing us the truth, that a lot of the ""art world"" is pretentious, she misses deeper truths. At no time does she convey the depth of conviction that many artists have about their work, or how that depth of conviction might be shared by a viewer."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Overview - It's a book about 7 different environments of the art world: * an auction (at Christie's in NYC) - below * a MFA crit session (at CalArt) -below * a visit to the Basel art fair (Switzerland) * the Turner prize in London * a visit to Artforum (magazine) * a visit to the studio of Japanese artist Takashi Murakami * a trip to the Venice Biennale Overall it was an easy read, but as an artist it bothered me. I have been to an art auction at Sothebys and have personally, gone through many critiques, so I could relate. What bothered me was that after an artist creates their ""work of art"", it becomes a ""commodity"" for the self-centered, big money ""collectors"". It's not really about the art but about money and being in the elitist clique. Initially I was reviewing each chapter until I got on the plane for a very long flight. Chapter 1 is what is happening in auction world -- the supply and demand of art, the different types of collectors and what ""3 D"" reasons (death, debt & divorce) would make a collector sell his art, why some things sells and others do not and the buzz and excitement of the auction floor of her experience at Christies in NYC. I have experienced an art auction at Sothebys in NYC. It is fast, shocking at times, always surprising and addicting! It was interesting to see a list of 9 living female artists who are now getting over a million dollars for their work. Paintings are still #1 medium especially with a ""buxom female"" being more popular than a male nude. Chapter 2 is all about ""the Crit"" (a seminar where MFA students present their work for critique from peers as well as the teacher). Thorton went to CalArts to observe Michael Asher who has been doing this with art students since 1974. It is an informal group with deep discussions. A crit can be painful when artists try to rational and defend their work. CalArts education is more focused on cerebral than talent of the hand. Interesting to me was Mary Kelly (a feminist conceptualist, who taught at many large institutions like CalArt, UCLA) who thought that it is fine for artists to have crits where they give an account of their intentions, but it shouldn't be the only way. Kelly says to her students ""Never go to the wall text. Never ask the artist. Learn to read the work."" I think everyone should ""read the work"" because we are all different and no two people will process the artwork the same."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is an anthropological study of a murky subculture given to bizarre rituals, riven by tribal conflict and prone to madness...the world of contemporary art. Sarah Thornton, our intrepid guide, comes at this woolly subject from different angles -- seven of them, to be precise, each set in a different city -- shining a light on the major clans and customs. The result is a surprisingly engaging account of how the frothiest end of the art market works (or doesn't), written in a way that a non-insider can understand. Thornton spends a day inside the New York branch of Christie's, one of the three major auction houses able to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of art to the extraordinarily rich in a single evening; a crit session at CalArts, where future artists learn how to disengage their thinking processes from the real world; opening day of the Venice Biennale, the art-themed amusement park for the very wealthy; and four other close encounters with the contemporary art scene. Her you-are-there approach is both vivid and clear. When we're not in the thick of things, she's telling us about conversations she's had with the market's movers and shakers that help explain what's going on. This is a reality show begging to be made: the camera follows Our Heroine as she scrambles through superstar pop-artist Takashi Murakami's studios, then cuts away to a talking-head interview with a guy who happens to be a top dealer or the publisher of the most influential art magazine in America, who explains it all for you. This book features a huge cast of characters. Owing to the incestuous nature of their world, they all know each other, attend the same parties, used to work in each others' galleries or newspapers, sometimes are (or were) married to each other, and speak the same obscure dialect of English. Thornton (a sometime reporter for ) does a good job differentiating the major players enough so that we can remember who they are when they pop up here and there. This crowd of characters is another reason this book really wants to be made into a reality show: instead of hillbillies with big beards or New Jersey midgets with precancerous tans, gives us a magazine publisher whose suits all come in primary colors, an art professor who teaches by not saying anything, megarich collectors, Turner Prize finalists who don't know whether they really want to win, and any number of other kinds of exotic fauna. The fifth star is missing because Thornton's prism has only seven sides, which leaves out a lot of the spectrum. While it's gratifyingly strange to spend time in Murakami's bizarre world, he's hardly a representative example of the non-celebrity working artist. We meet marquee-named dealers flitting about the edges of these vignettes, but never see what they do on a day-to-day basis, nor do we learn what life is like for the other 95% of gallerists and dealers. We're briefly exposed to the concept of private collectors starting their own museums to show off their prizes; it would have been interesting to watch that process play out in front of us. My own particular area of interest -- art crime -- never even gets mentioned; surely Thornton could've found a detective or insurance investigator to shadow for a day? is a cook's tour of the contemporary art scene's 1%, the part that generates headline nine-figure sales, receptions full of the glitterati, and incomprehensible statement art that will be coming soon to a museum near you. Don't expect to learn much about the workaday market and the not-famous people in it. Look at it as true-life science fiction -- a visit to a world full of alien creatures populating a parallel Earth on the opposite side of the Sun."

Lucky for us, she does so with grace and wit and every other attribute I would wish to exhibit when in attendance at one of these prestigious events. Not to mention her uncanny knack for never forgetting an important face or name, which would certainly be my first failing point. The social butterfly aspect aside (which is extremely useful in writing such a book, so it ought not be discounted), Thornton also does her homework and legwork - not only did she aggressively seek out many of her interviewees, but she also worked for a number of them for various lengths of time, most notably as a writer for Artforum.com. The icing on the cake (for me) that gained my unequivocal approval was Thornton's choice to interview Peter Schjeldahl, the art critic for the New Yorker who is my absolute favorite as far as art critics go. So I guess I am biased, although her lengthy visit to Murakami's studio had the opposite effect, as his attitude toward art, process, and life reinforces the distaste I have for him that began with my dislike of his artwork. But back to the book! I think it sums it up that Sarah Thornton treated both my favorite critic and one of my least favorite contemporary artists in ways that were engaging and has reinforced my fascination with the art world, despite all the flaws."

Early chapters on a Christie's auction of contemporary art, and a visit to the Art Basel fair were most interesting. It was instructive to learn how buying from a gallery is different from buying at auction, for example. But chapters on Takashi Murakami, the magazine , and the Venice Biennale were relatively lustreless, and Thornton felt too much the narrative; she spoke a lot in the first person, it was clear she had established friendships with many of the main players she was interviewing, and it was hard not to think of her as the pretty girl at the party, drawing the attention of elderly collectors at the auctions and fairs, swimming at the pool of the Hotel Cipriani in Venice with the large-bellied super-rich. In the chapter on , critic Peter Schjeldahl's comments are actually a lot more interesting than the ones coming from the publishers or editors. Someone at Art Basel says perceptively, ""The amount of art in the world is a bit depressing. The worst of it looks like art, but it's not. It is stuff cynically made for a certain kind of collector."" For me Murakami's art falls in this category (""the worst"" is a pretty big category, for me), but one doesn't get the sense that Thornton felt the same way as she wrote about Murakami."

Being relatively ignorant about any of this, I was surprised to discover that galleries at the upper echelons don't just sell to the first person willing to write a check, but look for a collector who plans to enhance the reputation of their artists through lending the art to public exhibitions and through his own reputation. Equally interesting, although not quite as informative, are the numerous semi-profound statements scattered throughout the book by various art world characters. One says without further explanation, ""Georges Perec wrote a novel without the letter . I think we can learn from that."" I don't know who this ""we"" is that he is talking about, but I am not one of them. I also enjoyed the visit to magazine, particularly the section where an editor suggests that at one period in its history the magazine suffered from ""the wrong kind of unreadability.""

And that aspect is, overwhelmingly, the economic. This is a book about how rich people have nothing to do with their enormous amounts of money, so they spend it on objects that may or may not be of any aesthetic value. But they are great status markers. I mean, would you even go to someone's party if they didn't have a Jeff Koons? No way, right? The first few chapters--one at a contemporary art auction, when at an MFA seminar, and one at an art fair--are really good. After that, it gets a little tedious, and nauseating, which is how people with so much money that they don't know what to do with it always make me feel, as well as people who structure their entire lives around giving said very wealthy people things to do with their money that aren't, e.g., paying taxes. Thornton makes no bones about the topic of this book; it is an ethnography, it is not at all interested in making aesthetic distinctions, and you'll have to decide for yourself if Takashi Murakami is interesting and if his work is worthwhile. I have a hard time believing that anyone could finish reading the book, however, without making a pretty strong aesthetic judgment on the people Thornton's writing about."

First, a bit of history about this book. The book club I attended chose this book for July's read. It was a complete accident that this book got chosen as we are, technically, a Fiction Book Club. But the cover looked interesting and it was out of most of our normal ""comfort"" zone, so chosen it was. I think my perspective on this book was changed from what it might have been due to the book I had read just before it. Since I had just finished a book on the world of pianos (rebuilding, repairing, musicians - both composers and performers) I was already aware of a world out there where names were given that others not immersed in the music world wouldn't necessarily know. So a low rating on the book was raised because I understood that I was not Sarah Thornton's ""prime"" audience. That said, she still came across as condescending. She dropped names quite liberally in a few chapters (specifically the chapter dealing on the magazine) and was pretty rude to a few of the people she talked to in the book. I didn't like the person writing the book but I appreciated the material, even if it wasn't something I shared a lot of interest in. That said - I was very interested in the first chapter.. and actually a chapter we discussed in our book club that I hadn't read yet.. and read following the discussion - the studio. There were some really, really dull chapters that I had to push myself through and there were chapters that had some interesting parts. I would say if you are interested in art and willing to do some googling to look up names and art pieces, then sure.. check out this book. But see if your library has it first!"

Thornton's book takes a look at the art college, the gallery, the auctioneer, the art show and of course the modern artist's studio to look at the modern art game from many angles. What impresses is the great level of the interviews with genuine and weighty insiders. The author must be well connected and is obviously tenacious, but the people she gets to and insights she gets from and through them are very interesting. It is not a judgmental exposé, or hatchet job - but you do get a good look at how it really is, from someone who knows the game and actually likes her art. I was given this from an artist I know as I am just as interested in how the art world works as the art itself. Of course, so are the artists; Warhol shocked with his statements about art, now we just accept Hirst et al, and Murakami (featured in this book) takes it to the level of a corporate branding exercise.

In the world that surrounds us, there are many smaller ""worlds"" that regular people don't usually have access to. Some, like the medical or forensic experts world, are explored through popular TV shows and mass media culture, so that the general population, not exactly being a part of it, still feels like they have some access and knowledge of it (even if it is of a highly romanticized, flawed and fictionalized account). Such a thing doesn't happen with the art world, the internal workings of which remain virtually shut off from outsiders (with a few exceptions). Sarah Thornton, the author, is a sociologist who adopts a ""cat on the prowl"" method rather than a ""fly on the wall"" one, that is, she immerses herself in the world she is studying, searching for situations and exploring them to their full potential. The access she obtains is remarkable, with some of the major players in the art world as interviewees, and the reporting of a few events that few people ever get to be a part of. This book is divided into seven parts, each depicting ""a day"" in a different part of the art world: the Auction, the Crit, the Fair, the Prize, the Magazine, the Studio Visit and the Biennale. I bought this book because, even though I'm technically a part of the art world she describes (I'm taking a Master's degree in Museum and Curatorial studies), there are still a few parts of it that are a mystery to me. The art world is rather schizophrenic, with intense contrasts and polarized beliefs and actions, and the book does a great job presenting this: for example, we have the very rich people who believe art is a commodity versus very poor art students who abhor words like creativity and never speak about money. There's a delicate balancing of these conflicting beliefs, and it's fascinating to see the mechanics behind that balancing. However, I have to say that the tone of this book was one of exaggeration. In all these stories, the volume is turned up high, and the people described and their actions seem at times so extreme that I started to wonder if they were not caricatures of themselves. It makes it seem like there is no place in the art world for balanced human beings or actions. This is far from the truth (again, I speak from my own personal experience); this probably happens because it's much more interesting to show the extremes than to make space in the book for less sensational situations. There was also a lot of name-dropping, a few of which weren't familiar to me, so I read this with a search engine in front of me. I actually loved that, since I like learning about new artists and critics, but I imagine that it can get tiresome for some people. All in all, this is a fascinating book if you're interested in the mechanics of the art world, with an easy to read (but still interesting) language, based on a remarkable research work. Definitely worth it."

Along the way you meet some of the great contemporary artists and the gallery owners who show their work and profit thereby. The amount of money being thrown around is mind boggling.

Imagine reading a series of Vanity Fair articles and that is this. The highlight of the book is also its Achilles’ heel. Thornton spent five years researching and interviewed 250 people for the book. She gained access to a lot of power players so while there are some amusing quotes, she leaves it up to the reader to make their own conclusions about the paradoxes and contradictions inherent in the contemporary art market. I wanted her to go off but oh well. If you ever came across the art documentary, Blurred Lines: Inside the Art World (also by a Canadian!), the documentary follows the same ground (auction house, fair, dealer etc.) and even interviews some of the same people, but it is much more insistent about regulating the art market as a solution for the art market bubble, although it too, ultimately, falls short of pointing a really critical finger at inequality in the art world. Thornton does an excellent job of demystifying how art is sold, what events matter in the art world and why that is so. I really enjoyed Seven Days in the Art World. There were some things I thought would have been cool to see: a behind-the-scenes look at one of the top museums in the world - Tate? MoMA? - and seeing what their concerns were, perhaps technology and social media and how they are disrupting the way we experience art for good and bad. A vibrant art community of young, emerging artists that were not so institutional such as the Turner Prize candidates, would have been cool to see, to see their concerns and their support groups. The Crit chapter was supposed to show young artists having this rite-of-passage moment at the end of their MFA program at a prestigious art school, but we didn't really get those genuine discussions of art. It focused on art students that would not likely be artists - one of the students was a guy who, due to family stuff, basically didn't prepare for his project but off they go. Incidentally, it made me hate art students. Thornton said in one of her press interviews that she kept some of the bullshit that the sources said because it was entertaining. Some of my favourite lines come from self-important but insecure collectors, but I really enjoy these for how earnest the speaker is to be both serious and blase:"

Because art schools charge so much, and there are so few artists who make a living from their art, and because art schools don't teach craft but only teach are from the ""wrist up"" it's quite literally extremely expensive ""to be an artist"". The usual route touted in the book is MFA, gallery show, museum show, solo show, winning awards...press in places like Art Forum etc. Fascinated by the idea that you don't teach a skill until the ""artist"" ""has a need for it."" So many art students, like many architects can't make anything with their hands. There's this disconnect. It's all concept.

Some of Thornton's interviews contain breathtaking definitions and questions of art and/or the artist. ""A protest against forgetting"" - Eric Hobsbawn, quoted by Hans Ulrich Obrist ""[...] do you choose somebody to make history or do you confirm history?"" Andrea Rose ""I was taught that one of the defining premises of modern art was its antagonism to mass culture [...] I could argue that Takashi is working within the system only to subvert it. But this idea of subversive complicity is growing stale..."" Scott Rothkopf ""I threw out my my general life, so that I can make a concentration for my job. You maybe expecting more romantic story?"" Takashi Murakami ""I love abstraction, but I even look at that kind of work for narrative content."" Jerry Saltz ""I was so sick of reading Hemingwayesque novels full of muscular lyricism. Contemporary art seemed to be taking more interesting risks than contemporary fiction."" Elizabeth Schambelan ""Don't things live not just by direct experience of them but by rumor, discussion, argument, and fantasy?"" Adrian Searle ""It's not about innovation for innovation's sake or the ambition to be novel or unique. All good art gives us an opportunity for a different relationship with time."" Matthew Higgs ""[Nicholas Logsdail] likes artists 'who are on a slow burn, very good, very serious, not in the fast track, but pursuing their own artistic interests with tenacity, quirkiness, and confidence.'"" ""What you work at, what you struggle for, what you have to take command of--that often makes for very good art."" Paul Schimmel ""To get the most out of your crit, you have to have a mysterious blend of complete commitment to your decisions and total openness to reconsider everything. . . I wanted to do something different. Students make work just because it stands up well in critiques, but outside the classroom it is often inconsequential."" Fiona ""You have to find something that is true to yourself as a person--some non-negotiable core that will get you through a forty-year artistic practice."" William E. Jones ""I don't care about an artist's intentions. I care if the work looks like it might have some consequences."" Dave Hickey ""It's about being open to the possibility of what you could know."" Mary Kelly ""Art comes out of failure. You have to try things out. You can't sit around, terrified of being incorrect, saying, 'I won't do anything until I do a masterpiece.'"" John Baldessari ""Baldessari believes that the most important function of art education is to demystify artists: 'Students need to see that art is made by human beings just like them.'"" Sarah Thornton, quoting John Baldessari ""Buying is much more American than thinking, and I'm as American as they come."" Andy Warhol ""It's not by chance that I went from cosmetics to art. We are dealing with beauty here. We are dealing in things that are unnecessary, dealing with abstractions."" Philippe Segalot ""The artist Francis Bacon once said that when MAN realizes that he is just an accident in the greater scheme of things, he can only 'beguile himself for a time.' He added: 'Painting or all art, has now become completely a game by which man distracts himself. . .. and the artist must really deepen the game to be any good at all.'"" Sarah Thornton, quoting Francis Bacon ""As they say in the movie industry, ideas are a dime a dozen. You've got to put it into some sort of form."" Thomas Lawson ""We hunt for students who are in some way on edge with their world."" Steven Lavine ""The decisions that go into making a work are often social."" Michael Asher ""Our view is that art should interrogate the social and cultural ideas of its time. Other places might want a work to produce pleasure or feelings."" Charles Gaines ""The work you do as an artist is really play, but it is play in the most serious sense, like when a two-year-old discovers how to make a tower out of blocks. It is no halfhearted thing. you are materializing--taking something from the inside and putting it out into the world so you can be relieved of it."" Leslie Dick ""An artist is someone who understands the border between this world and that one,"" he continued. ""Or someone who makes an effort to know it."" Takashi Murakami"

It has the feeling of having gotten the chance to mingle with and asking probing questions of many big players at significant event since. I found it fascinating. Most of the negative reviews I’ve read are from people who expected something different or something more, to be (as the title somewhat promises), about all of the art worlds (which sounds impossible to me), and for it to be more than an ethnography, whereas she is clearly focused on an ethnographic approach. It is hardly comprehensive or critical, nor is it meant to be. With the right expectations, it is well worth reading."

Sarah Thornton's writing is clear and interesting in a sense it's really easy to read and hard to put off your hand. It's an interesting journey through today's art world. From the artist's studio to museums and galleries, the Biennale's crowd and art collages. Thornton's journalistic qualities and a sort of new-journalism type of writing, help her in this book to investigate some of the most fundamental questions about art in this modern age. it's funny how the most basic questions she asks artists and students like ""So what is art"", get some angry and irritated looks instead of a decent answer. Her critical view puts things in perspective, and I can guess why some of the people dealing with art today might not enjoy her subtle sting she sometimes adds to the situations she's so colorfully describing. For example, the MFA student session at CalArts describing the sloppy students and their politically correct debates is just hilarious. What seems to be over-privileged MFA students who adore their teacher as a god, spending the entire day napping or eating pizza at class through different lectures and so. One has to ask what are they leaning anyway. I'm not sure if that was Thornton's intention but she sharply describes how American capitalist art acts through the garbage the students leave after the session. is that a symbol (or and art pieces) of what are they really doing there, turning self-absorbed art debates into piles of fruit and pizza's leftovers. The press conference with reality show victim is also another highlight moment in the book and described so surreal and smart. Another thing I really like about Thornton is how she first describes every new character she meets in the book, always describing what he wears or his body features. I was wondering why the rating of the book is not higher. I'm not sure but I can guess that some folks of the art scene really don't like the subtext that comes out of this book, her subtle ironic review of the art world in post-modern times, and that sometimes you can't help but wonder if this whole thing is a sport of rich people with way too much time money on their hand, buying and selling each other air. But the way she writes and the places she goes to, in my opinion, actually does a lot of service to today's art world, making it look like a scene you really want to be a part of. Excellent book for art lovers and surprisingly - also if you're interesting in good new-journalism writing style."

The writing was engaging and easy to read. I liked all the different point of views and seeing how these spheres interact with one another.

Not until had I read this book did I realize that the art world is a really complicated one. It does not only involve the artists themselves and their works but also lots of people and activities around. I got a wide knowledge after reading this book. However, this book is not for those who want to understand about the art itself because it just concerns the sides moving around in a practical world and the artists may get angry for this aspect, personally I think."

I most enjoyed the chapters about an art auction at Christie’s, the Turner prize as well as a visit of the studios of Takashi Murakami. The chapter on Artforum made me run out and get the latest copy of the magazine. (I admit, for the ads only and yes, they are terrific) The vapid posing occasionally had me cringing, especially in the in the chapter about a crit at CalArts. Still, I would have given the book 4 stars for enjoyment, had the author not had the pretension of calling her approach ethnographic research. This really had me chuckling. Thornton offers no analysis or reflexivity whatsoever. Instead, it’s an entertaining account of who’s who and what they wore. It was interesting to read this book just after by Siri Hustvedt. From art prize nominations to valuation of artwork, Thornton offers a number of stats that do not point in women’s favor. For example, at the time of publication, only *three living women artists traded for over one million at auction. In light of Hustvedt’s brilliant novel, every allusion to gender bias in the arts took on an even more ominous feel. Hustvedt, however, eludes stereotypes in favor of a thoughtful exploration of the driving forces behind creativity, status and power—a quality of depth that is sadly lacking in Thornton’s account. * Thornton also offers a more current, revised list including: Marlene Dumas, Cecily Brown, Yayoi Kusama, Bridget Riley, Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, and Lisa Yuskavage."

Cade, Kieran, and I decided to continue on from Ninth Street Women to another art themed book that revealed a completely different side of the ~ art world ~. This was well written enough and very easy to read. The format, spending a day in each of these different facets of the art world, felt fitting as a reflection of the way that this domain seems to function. After reading this, I have a much better understanding not only of the various pieces of the art world that exist but also how they interact (but do not often fit together). Art is such a fascinating part of culture given that it has all of these oppositional forces directing it at once: money, meaning, fame, talent, authenticity, technique, time, space, history. It’s clearly a very complicated subject to tackle, but I think that Thorton does a great job observing it all for you and giving you space to form your own opinions on what you get the chance to see through her insider eyes. Recommend for anyone who is looking to better understand all of that goes into making art as it currently functions go go go. Intro ...the art world relies on consensus as heavily as it depends on individual analysis or critical thinking (xv). Art needs motives that are more profound than profit if it is to maintain its difference from--and position above--other cultural forms (xvii). 1: The Auction (night @ Christie’s in NYC) People to note Christopher Burge (Christie’s chief auctioneer) Carol Vogel (NYT journalist) Amy Capellazzo (Chairman of Fine Art and Sotheby’s, previously @ Christie’s) Notes His haircut is so normal it defies description (I just love this sentence) (5). Warhol once said, “Buying is much more American than thinking, and I’m as American as they come” (29). 2: The Crit (Michale Asher’s Post-Studio crit @ Cal Arts) People to note Mary Kelly (feminist, conceptual artist) Michael Asher (pioneering conceptual artist, known for long long long crits) Notes Crits can also be painful rituals that resemble cross-examinations in which artists are forced to rationalize their work and defend themselves from a flurry of half-baked opinions that leave them feeling torn apart (47). You are materializing--taking something from the inside and putting it out into the world so you can be relieved of it (51). // Quote from writer/Cal Arts prof Leslie Dick Early mantra of Cal Arts: No technique before need (52). Mary Kelly, feminist conceptualist: I believe in education for its own sake, because it is deeply humanizing. It is about being a fulfilled human being (58). For students, creativity was a “lovey-dovey cliche used by people who are not professionally involved in art.” It was an “essentialist” notion related to that false hero called a genius (63). Perhaps creativity is not on the agenda at art school because being creative is tacitly considered the unteachable core of being an artist? (63) 3: The Fair (Art Basel, Switzerland) People to note Jeff Poe and Tim Blum (Gallery owners originally from LA) Don and Mera Rubell (Miami based collectors) Barbara Gladstone (gallery she’s been around since 57th street) Notes Happens at the beginning of June. All of the most important people go early and are vying to grab at the best pieces. People bring their art consultants. 4: The Prize (Turner Prize, world’s best known contemporary art competition) People to note Sir Nicholas Serota (Chair of Arts Council, England, previously the director of the Tate) Phil Collins (media artist, put shady lane productions in exhibit space) Rebecca Warren (sculptor) Tomma Abts (painter, won the prize in 2006) White Columns (oldest artist led exhibition space in New York) Notes 4 British working artists selected as finalists, one winner Phil Collins: “You might find a great work of art in someone falling over in a supermarket. That might be the most extraordinary visual encounter of your day” (116). Rebecca Warren: “I wanted to be as true as I could to the lineage of what I’ve been doing. Eventually things crystallize. Your work takes on a form that’s recognizable, or otherwise you’ll never be known” (127). Rebecca Warren: “A great work allows you to look at it without it nagging you. It’s not that it’s open to any interpretation, but it’s not got a limited fixed meaning” (127). Phil Collins: “...the best works are the ones that least confirm your expectations” (133). 5: The Magazine (Artforum) People to note Charles Guarino Knight Landesman Tory Korner (main owner) Adrian Searle (British art critic) Dupe: a dictionary of delusional conditions common to artists and critics by Jeff Gibson (Art Form Editor) Roberta Smith (NYT Art Critic) and Jerry Saltz (New York Magazine art critic) they are MARRIED! Also Peter Schjedahl of the New Yorker who apparently is known for being more accessible. Notes Adrian Searle: “Art critics are just spectators who say what they think … If I were an artist, wouldn’t it be truly dreadful if nothing we said about what I did? Don’t things live not just by direct experience of them but by rumor, discussion, argument, and fantasy?” (151). “That click from language back into the memory bank of experience is so exquisite” (173). “...the timeless conditions of being alive” - Jerry Saltz 6: The Studio Visit People to note Takashi Murakami (artist who runs Kaikai Kiki Co. in Japan and NYC) Oval Buddha (the piece Murakami was working on) Notes Six out of seven of the artists whose independent careers are promoted by Kaikai Kiki are female (!!!!) Nevertheless, he (Murakami) believes in the influence of media coverage and acknowledges that the studio visit is an important art world ritual for promoting art (196). “The most important thing for creative people is the sense that they are learning” - Murakami (197). 7: The Biennale (Venice, 2007) People to note Documenta (contemporary art exhibition that takes place every 5 years in Kassel, Germany) Robert Storr (director of the biennale that year, art academic) Francesco Vezzoli (Italian artist) Eric Habsbawm (British historian) Notes Each country has a pavilion and a different strategy for deciding which artists show that year. “Great art is essentially work that has proven inexhaustible in terms of the value it gives to those who pay attention to it” - Storr (229). “The thin boundary between art and entertainment is slowly vanishing” -Vezzoli (247). ...life as a protest against forgetting (250) Finally, art “that delivers the buzz of an epiphany or a bang of discomfort” (255)."

Thornton's slightly dry, mostly impassive tone, serves to highlight the various (sometimes incongruous) perspectives the different players bring to the art world: we see the somewhat aggressive ambition of the bidding collector crowd high on the adrenaline of the hunt of a desirable acquisition, the eccentric absurdity of the meandering Crit session and the dreams of the young artist, and also the anxieties of judges and shortlisted candidates amidst the hype of the Turner Prize proceedings. We are also privy to the reasons behind Artforum's advertising layouts as well as its editorial philosophy, the workings of hot Japanese artist Takashi Murakami and his company, along with his interaction with his dealers, as well as the unspoken hierarchies of artists, curators and collectors that undergird the action behind the festive circus of the Venice Biennale. Thornton consistently explores a tension between the idealistic, almost religious beliefs of certain players in the art world, and the blatant machinery of commercial interest behind the production, presentation and consumption of art."

I like that, since most introductions can be skipped if you plan on reading the whole book, and most conclusions are somewhat half-baked. There were two things that I really liked about the book. The first was her non-judgmental reporting. So many viewpoints were held by so many of the ""art world people"" that she couldn't possibly agree with more than half of them, yet none of the interviews came across as hostile. The only judgment that seemed to slip through was an occasional appreciation of the art itself, which seems fair. Secondly, the book was easy to read. She didn't couch her writing with piles of jargon or unnecessarily dense references to art theory and anthropology. If you think the book is elitist, you probably misheard the author's voice under the elitists she interviewed (there were a few - it is the art world)"
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"There's something thoroughly depressing about this book - from the perspective of someone who makes art, anyway. The in-your-face presentation of the artist as a pawn in so many other profiteering individual's plans is, I suppose, nothing new, but this book really drives it home. For 200 pages, that is. In the long run, it arms you with knowledge that you certainly will somehow benefit from, be this the world that you desire to participate in (in any capacity). Sarah Thornton's caveat in the afterward was interesting: if it reads like an extended gossip column, that's because it is -- the art world is so completely dominated by larger-than-life personalities, that to not somehow honor that in the text would be to render a substantially incorrect portrait of reality. Another thing: I wonder how she manages to get so many dinner invitations from art-world insiders? Bottom line, read it, get pissed, thank yourself later."

It's a bit of a joy to read as an arts administrator myself, though while she tries to ""go behind the glam"" of the art world, she definitely hypes it herself. I also think she leaves out some key aspects to the actual commodities of the art world. She sticks to interviewing super famous artists, patrons, and curators, while I think it would have been nice to mix in quotes and commentary from the proletarian art installer, or gallery registrar, or studio assistant. She vaguely uses these folks as backdrop, but I have found working within such a small inner circle as the arts, that it is amazing how these folks are really the glue to make all the visions and realities occur.... I mean that's part of the integral argument and skepticism around Murakami's work...."

Thornton visits seven icons of the art world, and devotes a chapter of her book to each. It is a very complex world. I had the picture of the artist working diligently in his studio, oblivious of the demands of the world. That is not the picture Thornton presents. Instead, she shatters my every illusion of the art world, including its aloofness from the world, its isolation from workaday worries about money, its purity. I know several artists who need to read this book."

I've covered the art world for the past 10 years or so and I think Sarah does a great job of explaining how a lot of the pieces of the art market fit together. I also like that she's not afraid to show some of the not-so-pretty sides of the art world.

Trying to be scientific in methodology, yet chronicling this insular scene is a tough narrative path. Some New Yorker writers like Gladwell can pull this off pretty consistently.

The writing is fairly good. Thornton's approach - segmenting the art world into a series of 'views' - makes for an approachable read. I think my problem is with the subject matter itself.

This book is an excerpt from an interesting period in art history, during which the art market flourished, museum visits soared, and more than ever before, people were able to quit their steady jobs and call themselves artists. During this era, the art world expanded, moved faster, and became more attractive, cooler, and more expensive. With the global economic recession, this exciting time has passed, but its deeper structures and mechanisms remain. The contemporary art world is a scattered network of subcultures that only slightly overlap, held together by a belief in art. These subcultures are scattered all over the globe, but they are denser in metropolitan cities such as New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin. Since the world of art is largely heterogeneous, ambiguous and officially secretive, it is difficult to make generalizations about it and it is impossible to say anything comprehensive about it. The author has tried to show these problems with seven narrators in six cities from five continents. Each chapter is a report of a day's life, each section is written on an average of thirty to forty detailed and complete interviews and several hours of participant observation. The first two chapters show two opposite ends of the spectrum. ""The Auction"" is a moment-by-moment account of a night at Christie's auction in New York's Rockefeller Center. Auctions are usually artist-free zones that act as an end point for works of art. In contrast, ""Critique Session"" explores this chapter of life in the legendary seminar of the California Institute of the Arts. ""Festival"" and ""visiting the workshop"" also have an opposite relationship; One is about consumption and the other is about production. While the workshop is the best place to understand the work of a single artist, a busy trade show festival where crowds and displays make it difficult to focus on a specific work. ""Festival"" takes place in Switzerland at the opening of Basel Art Festival; An event that has played a role in the globalization and seasonalization of the art world. Takashi Murakami, an artist who plays a supporting role in the Basel season, is the main protagonist of the ""Workshop Visit"" season; A season that takes place in his three workplaces and a foundry in Japan. Chapters 4 and 5 ""Award"" and ""Journal"" tell stories about debate, judging and public display. The ""Prize"" chapter examines the UK's Turner Prize; That's on the day when a panel of judges, chaired by Tate chief executive Nicholas Servata, will decide which of the four shortlisted artists will step up to the podium to receive the award at a televised ceremony. This chapter explores the nature of competition between artists, the function of awards on their careers, and the relationship between the media and the museum. In ""Magazine"", different views about the function and honesty of art criticism have been examined. The author begins his writing by observing those who publish the international magazine Art Forum, and then speaks to influential critics such as Roberta Smith of the New York Times, and then becomes an uninvited guest in a conversation between art history experts to examine their point of view. This chapter deals with how magazine covers and newspaper articles make works and artists enter the events of art history. The final season of the ""Biennale"" takes place in Venice amid the excitement of the oldest international exhibition of its kind. This biennial is a dizzying experience, like it should be somewhere on vacation; But in fact, it is a very professional event and so crowded that one can hardly concentrate on the artworks. This grace also addresses the point that memory plays a fundamental role in understanding the sense of contemporaneity and revision in determining what is great and important. In a part of the book's introduction, the author writes about his view of art in this book: ""The seven-day structure of the book expresses my view that the art world is not a system or a machine that works well and smoothly, but rather a mass of conflicting subcultures that each They have different definitions of art. All the voices in the book agree that art should be thought-provoking, but at auction, art is primarily an investment and a luxury item. At the festival, it is bat and tefnan, a slightly different item or something we saw at the auction. In the award, art is a museum attraction, a media report and proof of the artist's worth. In the magazine, art is an excuse for words; Something to discuss and promote. In the visit to the workshop, all the things we said are; This is one of the reasons for Murakami's sociological appeal. Finally, in the biennial, art is a tool to expand the communication network, a source of international curiosity and, above all, the main raw material of a good show."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I know I had seen or heard of this book before, but what prompted me to purchase and read it recently was listening to the podcast ""Death of an Artist"" which deals with the circumstances surrounding the life and death of the artist Ana Mendieta, who died under suspicious circumstances while married to another artist, Carl Andre. The podcast was a fascinating look not only at the circumstances surrounding Mendieta's death as well as Andre's trial allegedly murdering Mendieta; it was also a fascinating look at the politics, institutions, and relationships that permeate the world of contemporary art. The book was mentioned favorably on the podcast and when I was done listening to it, I wanted to read the book to explore the art world in more depth. On the back cover of the book, a reviewer for the Sunday Times in London is quoted as describing the book as ""a Robert Altmanesque panorama"" of the art world. This blurb set my tone for reading the book and as I read it, the book reminded me of nothing so much as the film Nashville, perhaps my favorite film of all time. Like Nashville, Seven Days in the Art World explores a unique community of creative people. While Nashville is a fictional chronicle of people involved with the country, gospel, and folk music industries in Nashville, Tennessee in the 1970s, Seven Days in the Art World is a non-fictional chronicle of the world of contemporary art during the 2000s in New York, New York, Los Angeles, California, London, Venice, Basel, Switzerland, and various cities in Japan. And like Nashville, the book does its work via a series of subtle and revealing slice-of-life vignettes involving a large cast of diverse characters. Like Altman, Sarah Thornton doesn't rely on heavy-handed tactics to tell us what to think about the people and events she chronicles. She leaves it to the reader to read between the lines and come to their own conclusions about the individuals and institutions that are described on the book's pages. Like Nashville, Seven Days in the Art World is a character study and the human types and behaviors chronicled will be familiar to virtually anyone, whether or not they have any personal experience with the art world. The information that Thornton supplies is not over the top or sensationalistic. Like Altman, she sticks to the realistic and representative, making space for the reader to subtly appraise what is going on, just like we all do all the time in our lives. As a slice of academic life, the chapter entitled ""The Crit"" especially resonated with me because so many of the dynamics described are applicable to academic life generally, not just the academic art world. ""The Studio Visit"" was also fascinating and introduced me to the life and work of Takashi Murakami. While I was actually very familiar with some of Murakami's popular work (the cover of Kanye West's album, Graduation, or the colorful LV designs on Louis Vuitton handbags that were all the rage when I was in high school and that were universally coveted at the time, including by me), until reading the book I had no idea that Murakami was the artist behind these works. The links made in the text between the post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki experience of the Japanese people, Buddhism, and the work of Murakami were particularly insightful and thought-provoking. (I also learned in the chapter entitled ""The Magazine"" that the founders of the journal October initially came out of the milieu of the magazine Artforum, which was particularly interesting to me since I've been assigned a number of pieces from that journal in my Ph.D. program.) If there was one glaring weakness of the book in my view, it's that not enough sustained attention was paid to museums as institutions and the people who work within them. Museums are a major art world institution and the primary link between the art world and the general public, so more emphasis on how museums operate would have been interesting and important. It's such a major oversight that I'm genuinely surprised that it goes totally unremarked upon. There is some attention paid to the museum exhibition in the chapter ""The Studio Visit"", but as it's not the main focus of the chapter there is not the richness of description surrounding museums that there is regarding the institutions that actually have a chapter devoted to them in the book. This book is a great example of ethnography done well. While I have read some ethnographies that seem intent on telling the reader what to think and pathologizing and over-analyzing everything said by an informant, Seven Days in the Art World does none of that. The book also refuses to fall into the trap of using circumstantial or societal factors to absolve the people or institutions chronicled of any negative associations whatsoever. After having read this book, I feel I have a much better sense of how the contemporary art world works and how fortunes are made in this environment. Highly recommended."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is probably a must read book for anyone who wants to understand how screwed up and academic the art establishment has become. But it is is also a bit of a fraud. Ms. Thornton covers only what she enjoys - then claims it’s exceptionally important. She fails to be a neutral writer or ethnographer. I was most dismayed by her claim to “ethnography”. Her book is anything BUT ethnography. Ethnography involves a disinterested observer (or observer with a pre-existing opinion taking an intentionally neutral position) and going into an environment with people to study their interactions. First, and foremost, to be valid research it requires that the ethnographer describe how the specific population segment they study relates to other populations. Ms. Thornton does none of this. She seems unable to discuss anything other than the small bubble she enjoys and admits to being an enthusiast for contemporary art. Somehow, that makes her incapable of understanding or explaining where contemporaray fits up against a much, much larger world of art and set of artists. (I suppose it was a great sales tactic though for hyping up the book and getting it bought by a publisher.) Perhaps her art history background worked against her - since art history isn’t a great start for understanding the true world of working artists. She also fails to sort out how to observe neutrally - no matter her opinion. Many of the characters she’s with assume persona’s of ""edgy"" while truly being pretty mundane - a fact she misses. She also fails to see (apparently) that they are rehashing essentially the same things that have been made for nearly 70 years...that little of the theories postulated by the collectors, critics, or artists are “new”. The writing covering the first two days is quite compelling and I enjoyed those parts (tho’ frustrated by her inability to be an ethnographer). The remaining 5 days were pretty dull writing - but I wanted to make sure I read through each of the events. I suppose her “studio visit” was most hilariously odd. It wasn’t a visit to a studio - but to a factory with the tour given by the CEO. Yet rather than search ethnographically to understand and give insight to this variation, she wholeheartedly embraces the CEO. It occurs to me that she’s particularly drawn to feeding frenzy fadisms - as her next book will be ""Seven Days in Silicon Valley"" - where the same kind of feeding frenzy thrives even though elsewhere there are solid, hardworking people who make what really matters. If you want, you might find it interesting to look up the medieval demon Belphegor who thrives in both Silicon Valley and the world of contemporary art... Perhaps this author has been captivated by Belphegor without understanding that’s what draws her."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Sarah Thornton's ""Seven Days In The Art World"" is a subtly observed, meticulously researched, fly-on-the-wall account of the world of contemporary art. The ""seven days"" of the title are in fact the seven different arenas in which artworld professionals play their roles: the auction house, the university, the fair, the prize, the magazine, the studio, and finally the exhibition. Shuttling between these are the players: curators, collectors, critics, auctioneers, dealers, and of course artists themselves. Thornton is an academically trained sociologist, and as such adopts an ""ethnographic"" approach to her subject. Like the anthropologist seeking to understand some remote indigenous tribe, Thornton realises that she is much more likely to succeed by adopting the neutral attitude of the ""participant observer"". So, rather than judge, challenge or criticise, she draws out the views of those she interviews by an open-minded sympathy. Mostly, then - with relatively rare digressions into commentary and editorial - the people and the differing views they express are allowed to speak for themselves. At times, this provides its own critique: the auction house specialist who bemoans the shallow taste of Park Avenue residents who are restricted less by budget than whether an artwork will fit in their elevator; the art magazine critic who recognises her constrained role as little more than press agent for the shows she reviews. In practice, however, Thornton's strategic ""neutrality"" and lack of critical analysis translates into implicit support. As she ultimately admits, it is ""the basic premise of Seven Days in the Art World that the work is important"", and therefore the worthiness of contemporary art is never fundamentally questioned simply because ""cynicism doesn’t appeal to me and disbelieving in contemporary art (as a category) strikes me as either nihilistic or retrograde."" This is, perhaps, fair enough - as personal conviction - but as a result the justifications for the sort of provocative and extravagant contemporary artworks that many struggle to value or appreciate - the unmade beds and pickled sheep - go unaddressed and unchallenged. If you're looking for a book that questions what art is, or a critique of contemporary art, then this isn't it. But if you are simply after a sociological insight into the rarefied and peculiar world of high-end contemporary art and how all the pieces fit together, then there is much here to admire and recommend."
Seven Days in the Art World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6988014-seven-days-in-the-art-world/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Sarah Thornton gave readers a glimpse of the art world via 7 different perspectives. She does not view the art world as a system but a whole made of several squabbling subcultures, and hence, appropriately used an ethnographic/anthropologic approach in research and writing. The effort to conduct 'participant observation' as much as possible gives her account a certain degree of credibility and I would think that it also painted quite an accurate picture of the art world. It was enjoyable to read about these different subcultures and hear what the insiders (collectors, dealers, consultants, artists, curators, students etc) have to say about art and what they do. I think Sarah Thornton did a great service to her readers by writing in a way that made it easy for readers to imagine as if they were there themselves; being in a Christie's auction, at Murakami's studio and speaking to a collector at the pool side at Hotel Cipriani. I doubt I would be able to attend a Christie's auction or be at a Turner Prize ceremony anytime soon, so thank you for that. I can imagine that 'serious' art people would be unhappy with this book, because it is not technical and did not go deep into certain topics. Some might argue that she depicted the art scene as a bit ostentatious or superficial, but I think its a great way to spike the interest of beginners of art. I found myself questioning the meaning of art along the way, and am intrigued by the multiple perspectives given by people in the industry. This book made me want to explore further about art, to read more about Dadaism, find out why Andy Warhol is so popular, think about the art scene in my culture, understand better the pivotal role of curators in illuminating the works of artists, and so on. Good penmanship given the purpose of this book. Overall a good introductory book about art."

Each is a surface look rather than a deep dive, but that’s what you’d expect in a book like this. Also, some of the sections are more interesting than others, also a by-product of the project’s concept. Thornton writes well and knows how to provide enough detail to give it weight, without overburdening it with jargon or too much esoterica. There are places where the content feels self-congratulatory or even indulgent, but that’s not the author’s fault — we are talking about artists here, and they are so exposed that a little egotism is to be expected. It does, however, make a few of the sections less interesting and engaging than others. OTOH, I think Thornton makes wise choices about what to cover — for example, though she references two European art shows, 1) they are very different from each other and 2) she identifies different issues to cover in each. It’s a great read and I learned quite a bit about contemporary art, which I knew next to nothing about. My only regret is that I listened to the audiobook, mostly while exercising, and thus couldn’t immediately look at the art itself on the internet. But again, not the author’s fault and a minor quibble. Grade: A"

Not a bad book, but rather surface-level insights into ‘The Art World’ - more so it highlighted the often-absurd art market practices without much deeper analysis. I still found it a fascinating inside look, and as an art history student it came in handy for a few assignments. Also having worked in the commercial art sector I can confirm that it is indeed sometimes a bit like Thornton describes… Basically the concept is great, it’s enjoyable and graspable whether you’re familiar with the art world or not, and her methodologies/overall aim are clearly stated which made it feel well-researched and Thornton a reliable narrator (when at times you might be hard pressed to believe parts are true). However I didn’t feel it held enough of a critical voice, or the authors voice whatsoever. She really did take a ‘fly on the wall approach’ and you can tell she doesn’t want to piss off her art world insiders and potentially damage her career? It felt silly and at times a little sensationalising. The art world is not ALL this madness she speaks of. Nonetheless I did thoroughly enjoy and will keep on my shelf forever/would read again. Unfortunately with books like this, they aren’t exactly timeless - so as far as a historical document goes this one serves as a pretty-accurate, albeit slightly surface level, time capsule of the art world in the early-21st century, pre-social media & mass-digitalisation. I’ll be keeping my eye out for more of Thornton’s writing for sure. I’m very keen to see her take on the absurdity of the art scene post-Internet."

The comfortable, satirical and sometimes sharp tone of 'Seven Days In The Art World' makes it a joyous read even for those who are not involved with the arts. Thornton's sociological point of view gives depth to the analysis provided in this book while her investigative journalist attitude helps her shine light on occurrences that are not usually seen or covered by the media. Unlike many other publications that revolve around the similar topic, Thornton instead of viewing and analyzing from a safe distance dives into a peculiar amalgamation of dealers, business people, artists, collectors, journalists and educators while traveling continents, cities and countries to presents first hand experience of what would be a parallel universe for many around the globe. This is a must read for those who dabble in the art world, although they must take the content with a grain of salt since it is an investigative report rather than an empirical research. It would also be a pleasantly exciting read for those who although not involved with the art world, seek to knowledge about it's mysterious nature."

This exciting snapshot in time takes lay readers behind the scenes of the specialized realms of the art world. By this Thornton means not only artists and dealers, but also reportage, art fairs, and large shows like the Venice Biennale. Each chapter is devoted to a different part of the scene, such as ""the crit"" and ""the studio visit."" Thornton's voice is ever-present, but she melts into the background and lets the artists, curators, dealers, collectors, critics, and other art scenesters take center stage. The result is a delightful work of popular non-fiction that will interest anyone who's always wondered a bit about art, and didn't know how to get started. It's learned, and yet still accessible to the average reader, and the choice to examine a week's worth of art world in a variety of different settings keeps the reader entertained. My favorite chapter was ""the auction,"" in which Thornton gives a blow-by-blow of one night at Christie's. It made me want to learn more about how art is bought and sold, and since I normally could care less about capitalism, that's a testament to Thornton's storytelling chops. This is a classic of creative non-fiction, so if you have it, don't weed it! You probably need a replacement copy at this point, though, so maybe get two when you do. Recommended for all public libraries and academic libraries that house popular nonfiction collections."

To be sure, this is only one corner of the art world, but a rarefied corner of big money, big ego and big cultural shifts. To begin to understand the empire that modern art now exemplifies requires a deeper understanding of the intersections described here in the form of seven ""days"". We see the juxtaposition of the various commercial aspects of buying and selling art, vs. the vagaries of making the art sold. We see into an auction house (or, the art market as engineering), an art ""fair"" (or, market as ego show), an art magazine (or, art as intelligence & art as advertising), and the Biennale (or, the art market as world view, and world changing)….these are mirrored against the ""crit"" (or, artists as neurotic), an art prize - the Turner Prize - (or, artists as the disaffected) and finally the studio visit (the artist as an industry to himself). Deeply enjoyable to read, but left me wanting - where is the museum, the curator, the lowly workaday artist, the movement towards street/movement art, craft as art, and so many other important influences and forms?"

Calling this the art world is like only referring to corporations in NYC as ""the business world."" Unrepresented are the perspectives of artists who are trying to make it and shape their communities in the process, curators who work every day in regional museums with limited budgets, etc. Thornton wrote a book that is gossipy, a little bit sensationalist, exciting... ... and maybe that's why it's a great read. After reading so many dense monographs and hyper-intellectual Artforum articles, I found it refreshing to read a book by somebody who reminds us that it's important to keep a sense of humor about this hobby. Thornton is a keen writer and with an obvious knack for building trustful relationships with those she interviews. She's totally judgmental -- that's part of her charm, and it's perhaps the only way that one could really get away with writing a book about the art elite. A nice break from the seriousness of art scholarship and a really entertaining read overall."

These separate spaces are connected and intermingle with each other (the editor of an art magazine will be at the Biennale for instance) but they each have different intentions and different relationships to art. As such, it's interesting to get a tour of these distinct communities and Thornton's book is a great way to explore them. Some chapters are more interesting than others, mostly because some spaces are more interesting (the auction house > biennale, IMO). Occasionally, some chapters are more fleshed out or seem more true to the general art world. One chapter visits the artist's studio, in this case Takashi Murakami's. While it's a super interesting chapter, Murakami feels like an exception rather than the norm; I would have liked to visit the studio of an artist that isn't also a team. That being said, a great introduction to the different art spaces... I do wonder how much has changed since this book was published over a decade ago?"

This book doesn't probe anything more complicated than powerful people's slight disdain for others who make the commercialism of the business too obvious. Artforum publisher Knight Landesman tells Thorton, with no irony apparent in the framing, that ""he loves the art world because 'it's a neutral ground where people meet and interact in a way that's different from their class ghettos.'"" (In 2021 Landesman stepped down after being accused of harassment by 21 women.) Where one could easily segue into the political structures underlying the lives and work of this international (i.e. from the U.S., Western Europe, or Japan) set of curators and collectors - say, during discussion of the national exhibitions at the Venice Biennial - there are instead more wistful asides about how important curation is. Of course interview subjects are going to put their work in the best light, but Thorton doesn't challenge them at all. Nearly everyone she talks to is at the top of the field, do they really need this?"

Thornton realizes her dynamic and works it into her writing, playing with both extremes. I’m sure her feelings and sociality were just as conflicted in the midst of her interviews and intermingling visits. You can tell from her tone that she desires to be part of the gossipy, name-dropping world about which she writes, while at the same time, she leans back amused at some of the shop-talk antics and dynamics she explains, but will never intimately understand. Although already dated because of the the contemporary changeability of art, Thornton’s glimpse into several aspects of the art world is worth a read; it’s a smorgasbord of how curators, artists, professors, collectors, and journalists intersect over a variety of mediums. Overall, it’s a sufficient sample of an art immersion experience. Have a device nearby to look up particular artists, museums, works, and other information. The visual supplementation will greatly enhance your experience reading the book."

I was excited to read ""Seven Days in the Art World"" after that and I enjoyed the book as much as her presentation. She is as witty, entertaining and intelligent as a writer. I particularly enjoyed how she addressed the taboos that the art world has about the art market and the huge amounts of money and speculation in it and the relationship between artists and the commercialization of parts of their work. I also liked the great quotes she accumulated from curators, art historians and artists. Even though, ""Seven Days in the Art World"" may seem like a book for people who already have a certain knowledge of the art scene in general, I thought she did a good job at asking basic questions like ""what is an artist?"", ""what is the role of a curator"", ""how does the market influence an artist's career?"". All those questions make the book available for readers who are not that knowledgeable about art and are curious to learn more."

I see a lot of reviews complaining about how this disregards a lot of the magic of art and the creative experience and well….yeah obviously. Think it’s kind of naive not to acknowledge how intertwined art and commerce are and this book did help me understand it a lot more; more than just taking about the actual creative process would. I also work in the more “business” side of a creative industry so I’m also predisposed to understand this angle. Regardless…more art industry / history by women please! Looking forward to diving into this topic more.

It talks with such reverence about the record for the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at an auction being broken for the first time since 1988, but then you find out this record was broken 6 times in the last decade. It's also disconcerting to see how artistic work can simply go in and out of fashion. Gerhard Richter did not sell at Christie's even at its starting price in 2006. The market was saturated with Richters, meaning everyone who wanted one already got one. That record for the most expensive artwork - Richter broke it in 2012 and then again in 2013. I guess the contemporary art scene is very transient indeed. While I cannot recognise most of the names they were talking about in 2006, there is also not a single mention of David Hockney or Banksy. And don't even get me started on NFTs. Their sole existence undermines at least a few chapters of this book."

The author has access to many power players: head auctioneers at Christie's, curators of the Venice Biennals, an important Japanese artist, the executives behind ArtForum magazine, to mention a few, so the writing rings true. Unfortunately for me, I do not grasp or like this type of art, so I kept shaking my head (why would anyone consider THIS art?) and focused on the business aspect, to more head shaking (what?!? 11 million dollars for a bunch of vaccuum cleaners under a plastic cover?).

I think it may have to do with the way it’s written. The author maintains a very sustained, intimate way of conveying things, almost like a friend letting you in on the latest gossip. I personally found it difficult to sustain attention for that large volume of words spent talking on people I don’t know and don’t really care too much about. In my opinion, gossip is best distributed in smaller, bite-sizes chunks that are easier to digest. I had to skip the last two vignettes altogether since it was just SO much, even spreading out the reading over the course of a week. The chapter on art school students was particularly exhausting as well as the one on Artforum magazine.

She spends a day with an art school class, an artist, an art auction house, and even the Venice Biennale. It was super refreshing to be able to read and gain exposure to so many of the players that you don't usually see in the art world! These players are usually plugging away in the shadows, and there is very little coverage about how their worlds operate. I would say that if you're interested in the art world, and want to go beyond just understanding the paintings in themselves, this is a great starting point to also learn about the entire supporting industry that props ups those works and enables art capitalism to flourish."

I read this for my Art Theory class at Washburn University. I am surprised that this book gets so many bad reviews - I really enjoyed it! I'm satisfied with the level of detail that she gives because this is not meant to be an in depth primer on art theory or history - it is supposed to a high level observation of 7 different facets of the art world and I think Sarah Thornton does a splendid job at that. It is a treasure trove for those who like to fall down the rabbit hole of research - there are lots of references for things to go look up later, if you want more detail (which I do).

While people in this book may reappear owed to the small world of the 1%, few links exist between the chapters. The dearth of photographs are going to be felt by most readers...

My favorite chapter is ""The Magazine"" because working in a magazine myself I could recognize what was happening (the descriptions, the hierarchies, the subtle tug of war editorial and advertising).

I don’t think anyone could have done a better job of encapsulating the Art World, to my knowledge.

So detached from the human experience is this world that you can't read it without a welling of disgust within you for its players.

Personally I found the chapter about Murakami’s art studio the most interesting and insightful, while others stretched on. Is it a good ethnographic overview of different aspects of the art world?

Shades of great empire-in-decline essayists abound (Didion’s poker faced prose is a clear template) but the unflinching ethnographic attention to this one odd corner of production and consumption sets this apart from everyone else’s dabbles. Chapters on the Christies auction, the art school critique, and the Venice biennale are especially abundant in absurdities, enough to almost get a glimpse the grounding of a more grounded critique of the whole — ie one that grapples with Capital, not just capital. A fine way to start what promises to be an abundantly absurd and incompletely critiqued year."

The seven days refer primarily to distinct settings, including an art auction, a critique session, and a major art fair, to give the reader a holistic look at how the high money-making work functions. Of course the author just about touches all these aspects, so if you want a more in-depth look, this book might not be it.

It's written from a reporters point of view of the art world so she doesn't really get everything right but it was overall a decent (and depressing) look into the art world and the monetary issues that control it. HOWEVER, the author covers only that segment of art that she enjoys - then claims it’s exceptionally important.

It's something I adore, but softly, passively, and often forgetfully—very nice while it's happening, but flitting away quickly after I'm on to the next. And then sometimes there is a book that is more like a red hot fucking coal, a thrum nearly audible whenever I'm close to it, a magnetic pull that stops me doing anything else and zings me back so strongly that I just want to bury myself in its tinnitus at all times—five minutes in line a the bank, two minutes in the elevator, thirty seconds while my coffee date checks her email—gorging myself with sentences and paragraphs until the whole world recedes and shrivels into flat black-and-white nothing. This, this, this is one of those books. It's a book that bracingly reaffirms my faith in literature, making me endlessly astonished by its power and poise and brilliance. I know I am constantly chided for hyperbole, but this is truly one of the greatest books I've ever read. Probably it's a result of the endless march of mediocre books that plague the publishing industry these days—self-pub and traditional; I'm holding the major presses hella accountable too—but a book like this, so full and deep and flawlessly constructed, is just such a shock, such a pure clear joy. Every element is fucking perfect. Every element, truly! The plot, the characters, the pacing, the tone, all the little details, so so many tiny details, all perfectly, astonishingly slotted into place; the patois and the slang and the dialogue and the descriptions, oh my god the descriptions, from a smile to a chandelier to a mood; even the goddamn chapter epigraphs, which, who even reads those? But they're perfect, she's perfect, this book is just a knock-down, drag-out wonder. And it covers , with no shortcuts: from the Upper West Side moneyed elite to gambling addicts in the suburbs of Vegas, from a Lower East Side drug den for decadents gone to seed to the charming Christmastime streets of Amsterdam. Nothing is two-dimensional: if a characters restores furniture, you will learn so goddamn much about wood and veneers and myriad adherents; if another is a sailor, you will feel the wind in your hair and the goddamn spray of surf on your cheeks. Philosophy, art history, baccarat, heroin. Proust, childhood bullies, Russian drug-dealers. The cut of a jewel, the play of light through a crooked blind. The way a small dog remembers someone it hasn't seen in ten years. The way the very rich handle mental illness in the family. The way a teenage boy feels after taking acid for the first time. The bonds between people that last a lifetime, many lifetimes. The power of art to change a life, to change a million lives; the immortality of a work of art and the line of beauty that connects generation after generation of appreciators. How it feels to be always and ever in love with the wrong person—and how perfect and perfectly flawed she is, or he is, all the same. The way people age. The way people cling to each other at the wrongest of times, in the unlikeliest ways. The way people , my god, there is a Russian character (probably the best character in the book) who learned to speak English in Australia and you can that fucking incomprehensible accent, the hitch of verbs mis-conjugated in just the right ways, the tossing out of slang words in four different languages, so casual and so perfectly apt. The way a life is made of recurrences, circlings back and back, openings out and out and out. Five stars, five hundred stars, five million. ALL THE GODDAMN STARS FOR DONNA TARTT FOREVER."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Never have I been so conflicted about a book. Parts of it I loved. Parts of it I hated. Sometimes I wanted to praise it. Other times I wanted to abandon it. I'm relieved I've finally finished this novel (771 pages! Good grief!) because I can stop debating whether or not to keep reading it. It's difficult to talk about without being spoiler-y, but I shall try. What I appreciated most was the lovely prose — some sections are truly beautiful. Donna Tartt can write an arresting paragraph, to be sure. Here is one that gave me pause: So, yeah, this book is depressing. The story opens with a young boy, Theo, surviving a terrorist bombing in a museum, but his mother died and he feels responsible. Meanwhile, Theo steals a famous painting, one that shows a goldfinch chained to a perch, because his mother had loved the painting and he wanted to keep it safe. For the rest of the novel, the fate of the painting hangs in the balance. Theo agonizes over how and when to return it, and what crime he'll face. Eventually he ends up in the art underworld, caught in a complex scam. So the plot is rich and detailed, but my complaint was with the characters: I didn't like Theo, or his dad, or his dad's girlfriend, or his friend Boris, or Boris' girlfriend, etc. And Theo makes so many bad choices throughout the novel that it was difficult for me to care about what happened to him. Spending more than 700 pages without caring about the main character was a bit punishing. (And yet I kept reading! It's like I was that poor goldfinch chained to the book.) There was also too much written about repairing furniture, and WAY too much coverage of Theo's drug and alcohol abuse. I understand that he had post-traumatic stress disorder and that he was anxious and fearful, but I didn't need to read dozens of pages on how drunk and high he was. I don't think this novel had anything new to say about altered realities or making dumb decisions when you're bombed. While reading, I frequently made comparisons to Tom Wolfe's a similarly long novel with an unlikable main character who gets caught in a dark web. Bonfire was considered the book that defined the '80s decade, and it seems like Goldfinch is poised to be the book that defines the post-9/11 era. I'm glad I've read it, but I'm even more glad I'm done with it. I finished this book about two weeks ago and when I talk about it with other readers, my most salient feeling is how anxious it made me. I was anxious about the painting. I was worried about Theo's survival. Boris and his kamikaze behavior made me jittery. The section in Amsterdam made me so uneasy I had to skim to get through it. I say this as a caution to other readers: This book is not a carefree or an easy read. You have been warned. It's been a year since I read The Goldfinch, and every time I see a copy of this book, I shudder. I cannot think of another novel I've read that made me feel more relieved to have finished it. I have heard friends say they had to abandon this book because it made them too anxious. Can you suffer PTSD from a book? If so, this one caused it."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Oh, to be walking in New York on a weekday morning...on your way to an overpriced diner breakfast...stopping in at the Met...seeing a gloriously well put together exhibit of Dutch art...staring at a painting that changes your life…maybe the museum explodes, who’s to say? What I wouldn’t give for that right about now. I won’t be picky about the explosion. Reading this was a strange experience for me, one because it’s about eighty-seven thousand pages long (or 800), and two because I read it approximately a month into the stay at home order, and so even things like “having a bad trip and being injured with your friend in Las Vegas, and also you’re like twelve years old” and “suffering immense grief, but while sharing bunk beds with your pal in a gorgeous New York townhouse apartment” gave an overall effect of wow...outside...going places...with people? Divine. Plus, 800 pages gives you a lot of time to feel a variety of feelings. (Very astute of me, I know.) For the first 250 pages, this was a five star read for me. For the last 50 pages, it was also 5 stars. So generally speaking, if you pulled a book of normal length out of this gargantuan tome, that regular-sized volume would have been a perfect read for me. (#Synonyms.) However, there were 500 other pages, and those fell somewhere around 3 stars. Still, I get how they were necessary, and all the same I could spend the rest of my life only reading Donna Tartt’s writing and be content, so 4 stars seems like a more than fair compromise on my end. As with , this was an utterly immersive reading experience for me, but in some ways even more so. In The Secret History, I felt separate from the narrator - so while I felt myself present on his campus and in his friends’ fancy New England lodgings, I was able to make up my own mind about characters at any given time. Not so with this one! I felt like I was Theo. I understand why he did everything he did. I felt his anxious protectiveness over the painting. I felt his need for love and belonging. And more to the point, I felt about all the characters who made up his life as I imagine (or know) that he did. I pine for a simple life of art and love in a Village townhouse with Pippa and Hobie (and I feel panicked to provide for Hobie, to prove myself to him, and in so doing prove that his love isn’t conditional even though I fear that it is by never ever giving him a reason not to love me). I feel dread mixed with love when Boris appears. I feel willing to resign myself to a loveless life of fulfilled expectations because I want to make someone happy, and I know that I can make Mrs. Barbour happy. Above all, I have a longing for Audrey like Theo does. I spent her absence from this narrative desperate for her to appear again. You don’t find stories like this often. Bottom line: For better or worse, this is an everyone-should-read-in-a-lifetime book. --------------- day 7 update: - i finished - i miss it already - also it's day 8 review to come / 4 stars --------------- day 6 update: - i'm back on board --------------- day 5 update: - i am LOSING STEAM --------------- day 4 update: - maybe like 75 pages? - i forgot to even post this update which should tell you my mindset for this book yesterday --------------- day 3 update: - about 100 pages done today - oh god am i entering a reading slump - pray for me - tell my family and my books i love them --------------- day 2 update: - okay only like 50 pages today - at that rate i'll finish this book in 2029 - i want very badly to go to a museum with Theo and his mom, which feels a bit on the nose in terms of my self-destructive tendencies --------------- day 1 update: - 228 pages in - made a family tree for fictional characters for the first time in my life just to keep track - am ready to cancel all my plans, quit my jobs, and evolve past sleeping in order to dedicate all my time to this book --------------- me: i want to read a book every day!! also me: i want to read this book, which is so long that picking it up is the closest i've ever come to weightlifting"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have not read Tartt’s two previous, and by most accounts, superior novels. In The Goldfinch you can see that the talent is there but something is drastically off in the storytelling. The book drags and drags. It exasperates with unnecessary detail that calls annoyed attention to a critical lack of credibility throughout. The narrator is like one of those panhandlers who stop you on the street and provides too long a story about some travail: my mom and I were just mugged they took her to the hospital and I need to get to New Jersey to tell my dad who’s deaf but first I have to get to the hospital which is like a thirty minute cab ride away in Brooklyn and she needs this medication that was in her purse which got stolen but I didn’t get a chance to tell the EMTs about so I have to find a Duane Reade and get the prescription filled which costs about fifteen dollars if you could just help me out with part of it I’ll pay you back like tomorrow I have my address and phone number written down here I am really embarrassed and would never ever ask a stranger for help like this but this was our first ever trip to New York City and we never thought anything like this still happened but…. They are telling you so much because they want more than the average panhandler, not quarters or a buck but a ten or twenty. They hope the detail dazzles or distracts. However the more they tell you the more you know it’s all a lie. The extra details only betray. In the betraying detail is in things large and small. Theo, the narrator, notices and remembers everything but no one else seems capable of noticing anything in the moment even when it’s their job to. As a reader you are left wondering, for example, would a teenager struggling in shock through a scene of devastation have noticed and remembered fourteen years later the names on office doors as he is trying to find his way out of a bombed building? You never believe that Theo could have left the museum without anyone noticing him, but he has to. So an immense amount of detail is added to provide a masking confusion. But if he was in the building long enough following the explosion for emergency personnel to arrive, begin rescue efforts, and then leave the building because of fear of another bomb, would there have been a door within the cordoned off perimeter that didn’t have police and emergency workers watching it? Reduced to a plot line everything in the story can be made plausible; transformed into 771 pages of excessive description and your skepticism is teased and taunted from the beginning and at every turn of the page. A book this long needs to be put down frequently: you are at your stop on the subway, it’s time to move a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer, time for a meal or bed. Only once did I put down with regret that I couldn’t continue reading. Every other time I was relieved. At page 100, 200, and even at page 700 I wasn’t sure I was going to continue reading until the end. This isn't to say the Tartt can't craft a sentence, isn't well-read or a capable researcher, or smart as a whip. She can and is. But in execution this is tied for the most tedious and disappointing reading experience in 2013. is the story of a stolen painting and a lost boy and the many bad decisions he makes, influenced by bad genetics and the bad example of his father, by the trauma of violence of the worst kind, and several kinds of dislocation. At no point does Tartt convince you that Theo is something other than a poorly realized grand idea and that the plot, character and actions are more than an academic exercise. The novel has been called Dickensian in its marketing campaign and by some critics. It has also made ’s list of five best works of fiction in 2013. Both facts baffle me beyond words."

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was a huge disappointment for me. The opening New York sections were excellent, the description of the museum bombing and the whole Mansfield Park thing Tartt has going with Theo and the Barbour family, all of this works beautifully. I was excited to keep on reading to see where it all ended up, but once things move to Las Vegas the story takes a seriously wrong turn. I seem to be a minority opinion here, but there you have it. I do remember sitting up all night in 1992 reading The Secret History. But this is something else... I have to wonder for whom Tartt thinks she's writing. Does she really imagine that intelligent adult readers are going to be enthralled with hundreds of pages detailing the antics of a pair of burned-out druggie teenagers who spend their time smoking weed, swilling vodka, and dining on packets of sugar and whatever junk food delicacies they can boost from the local supermarket? Well, perhaps they will, the book *is* on the NYT besteller list. But once all the hype and interviews die down...who knows? The comparisons to Dickens are particularly inappropriate. Dickens wrote about orphans and other unfortunates who are on the receiving end of undeserved bad luck, but his characters struggle *against* degradation and dissipation. Poor little Joe the crossing sweeper sleeps in Tom All Alone's because he has no other choice. But here Theo and Boris revel in their squalor and dissipation . (Boris is the kind of character who seems to exist only in books and movies: the burn-out loser druggie who is failing all his classes in school but is really a secret genius who reads Dostoevsky and Thoreau in his rare sober and lucid moments. Yeah...right. I've been to high school. Burn outs are burn outs). Nor is there any hint of Dickens' rollicking and life-affirming humor in the book. In fact there is no humor of any kind whatsoever (at least not as far as I read). Not a drop of wit. No one even cracks a halfway decent dirty joke. And then there is Theo's father, an inveterate gambler deep into the loan sharks, and his aging sexpot girlfriend Xandra...both potentially interesting characters, except they are presented in one-dimensional terms throughout their stay in the novel, and really exist for no other purpose than to end up the way they do (at least in the case of Theo's dad). Wasted opportunity. Too bad. I gave up halfway though the book. There is just such an incredible ugliness about all (or almost all) of the characters that I found I didn't care a damn what happened to them and certainly didn't want to spend any more time with them. The ironic part is that Tartt is an incredible writer, a master of descriptive prose, attentive to detail and able to create a truly believable world on the page. Too bad it's such a rotten world."

I'm not even half way yet and I'm wondering if I will be able to weather this ridiculously long book that keeps getting sidetracked by just about every teenage pothole you can think of. And can we talk about motherless orphans? I've lost track of how many motherless main characters are in this book. How can I be this far out of touch with other reviewers? ------ Halfway thru now. Spending lots of energy trying to be less harsh and trying to enjoy the ride tartt is taking me on. But I am not succeeding. This book is utter ridiculousness. Not believable at ALL. and this morning my friend informed me it was named Book of the Year. I'm speechless. --- Three quarters done. Bottom line: Theo has become a very unlikeable guy. The pages and pages of minutia detail -- often building intrigue and suspense -- are pointless and often left unresolved. Reading this book reminds me of watching the tv show Lost. You think ""MAN. I wonder how they are going to explain that polar bear!"" Only to wait four more years and find out that they never do. --- Oh. My. Gosh. I just finished. The ending does not disappoint. What a diaphanous extravaganza of words. Of lists. Of never-ending stream of consciousness pompoonery. Yes. I made that word up. It's the merging of pompous and tom-foolery. Is Tartt serious? Can she really be seriously presenting up this book with a straight face? The ending is... Utterly astonishingly perfectly awful. If you are reading this and wondering if you should finish the book. Yes. Do it. Then report back here. I need the company. ----- **Update on 4/1/14 After 400+ comments to this review that was never meant for any purpose other than my own entertainment so that I might remember the book, I feel the need to add the following: To anyone wondering if they should still read this book, since reviewers are so divided (eg you either LOVE it or HATE it) : by all means, YES. Read it! But: if you find you are hating it within 100 pages, just put it down and walk away. Because it won't ever get better for you (Really. do as I say and not as I do: Put. It. Down.). For those who LOVE this book: Good for you! I am truly happy for you. There is nothing better than a book you love! ---Now move along, because the 9+ pages of comments here are for those who don't and will just make you mad. :)"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Goldfinch is a brilliant story with memorable characters and most of the book is incredibly well done and fun to read. ""Most"" being the operative word. Tartt needed an editor to cut out a lot of the repetitive detail (Like several other reviewers, I too found myself page skimming -- sometimes the detail is fascinating, oftentimes it's unnecessary and just slows down the story.) There are a few other nits a good editor could have fixed, e.g. the internet makes cameo appearances but it's inconsistent - characters will make use of it in the way people do in 2013 but then later in the same scene they seem to forget it exists (and there's much more of the latter than the former-- Tartt recently did an interview with the New York Times where she admits to only using the web ""to look up phone numbers"" and her unfamiliarity is pretty evident, which is a problem in a novel whose main protagonists are 20somethings), a number of key plot points are telegraphed way in advance in a manner that feels more heavy-handed than than skillful, there are minor-but-critical unexplained plot points (e.g. why Theo's mother never considered leaving his father) whose omission seems curious in a novel that goes into such minute detail about everything else. And then of course there are the adult Theo's relationships with women, all of which seem overly chaste and prim and bloodless (especially compared to his relationship with Boris)-- even when he professes otherwise. There's a lot of Great Expectations in this novel-- I can't imagine it's coincidence that one of the main characters is called Pippa-- and Tartt frequently uses Dickens beloved device of the happy coincidence to move the plot forward. Usually Tartt makes the device work, but there are other times where the plot twists seem plucked from a forgettable TV movie of the week. The final chapter could also have used some heavier editing--"" philosophizing"" is a great way to end Theo's story, but the chapter just drags on forever, like a well meaning guest who won't stop saying goodbye. I gave it 4 stars because it's a really masterful story and the fairy tale quality makes it markedly different from so much of modern fiction. I just wish the editors would have had a heavier hand."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"As I read the reviews I am fascinated by the fact that I agree with aspects of many of them, whether they rate the book one, two, three, or even four stars. Even the positive reviews point out the very many flaws. I suppose it all comes down to what you are willing to tolerate in a novel. I found Tartt's writing to be at times quite lovely, but I got the feeling she is a little too enamored with her own skill. I am surprised to see the novel described as ""dense."" It was very, very (unnecessarily, in my opinion) long, but it was the opposite of dense. More like bloated--with lots of pretty fluff. When Theo is making his (again, long and mysteriously uninterrupted) way out of the Met in the beginning, I knew right away I was in for a severely under-edited read, and suspension of disbelief of inordinate proportions would be called upon. I am not a reader who must like or identify with the main character, or even any of them, but I do require them to at least be interesting or representative of a larger idea in some way, if not, then I at least want to be able to root for them. Here, I found the characters unlikable (except for Hobie and Pippa, but they just fade in and out) and with no real emotional resonance. Theo's mourning for his mother in particular, felt vaguely like a lovesick teenager's rendition of grief in a creative writing class. His relationships with women are so shallow and unconvincing as to suggest that he is deeply closeted. But with his lecturing at the end (pursuing what your heart desires, etc), I would think he would come clean on this point if that were the case. Even the discussion of the eponymous painting is lacking. It's as if the author didn't bother to research the piece--does she not know that Google exists? All the muddled philosophizing at the end left me unimpressed. In the end it was, in the words of Bart Simpson, ""just a bunch of stuff that happened."" A long, mostly tedious read with very little (or no) payoff. If you are like me and finish a book you start no matter what, I would seriously give the reviews here a read before committing to it."

Very honest. If you are reading this, asking yourself, should I read this book which is 771 pages? Very heavy, not that The Idiot was not 656 pages, so not length I am afraid of. If you are wondering, should I read? I answer for you already and say no! I am one of best things in book, at least not all the time moody, gloomy and so stupid I do not not even look in package. Even though I am very important character I must tell you, not worth your time to read this. (Okay to read beginning, some middle, end) but if was me, better to be having a pop than all the time reading about depressed guy who wastes so many good drugs. Bad things happen. All the time bad things. Does not mean cannot enjoy life. Does not mean should make many people spend very much money on depressing book. Not to say is not masterpiece to some people but why spend money on this misery. Cannot all own masterpiece. Potter think he is only one lose mother. In book we none of us have mother. Does not take 771 pages to figure this out. I would maybe read this if just 400 pages, as long as there would not be such long stretches without me. Potter needs me all the time. Not good without me. His one girl, Pippa, is smart not to let him make her into mother. If I was my good friend Theodore Decker and could not enjoy life at all I would do better job at killing self. Also honest opinion on how they say everyone is reading this book. If I tell you jump off cliff, you do it? Many times I drag Potter from middle of road where he claims to be waiting for car. Did I tell him lie in street? No. So I tell you. Only good thing can come from reading this book (maybe not even need to finish) is lots to talk about with people. Much discussion. Maybe if book from library or stolen worth it? But to buy own heavy copy? Could not even drop in canal without Dutch police all over you. Is better this way. ""Trust me."""

The Goldfinch was the book to read last year, so I didn't read it. Happily I corrected that over the last few weeks! It's the story of young Theo whose mother dies in a terrorist explosion at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the ensuing chaos, Theo escapes with his mother's favorite painting, The Goldfinch, a priceless Dutch masterpiece that becomes Theo's secret treasure and also the albatross around his neck. The story follows Theo into adulthood, through a series of tragedies and misadventures, until at last, he must face the music in regards to the missing painting. The novel is part coming-of-age story, part mystery, part rumination on the value of a human life versus the value of art. The writing is evocative yet accessible. The characters are wonderfully evoked. Tartt knows how to keep readers engaged with a compelling plot, yet the story is about much more than what happens to Theo and the painting. It's about loss and grief and loyalty. It's a remarkable read. I almost had to stop reading the book when Theo's ne'er-do-well father came on the scene because he was such an ass I wanted to strangle him, but later in the book, Tartt made even that character seem understandable, if not sympathetic. And Boris . . . what a creation! If nothing else, read this book to meet Boris."

Congratulations Donna Tartt!*** ”And I’m hoping there’s some larger truth about suffering here, or at least my understanding of it--although I’ve come to realize that the only truths that matter to me are the ones I don’t, and can’t, understand. What’s mysterious, ambiguous, inexplicable. What doesn’t fit into a story, what doesn’t have a story…. Because--what if that particular goldfinch (and it is very particular) had never been captured or born into captivity, displayed in some household where the painter Fabritius was able to see it? It can never have understood why it was forced to live in such misery: bewildered by noise ( as I imagine), distressed by smoke, barking dogs, cooking smells, teased by drunkards and children, tethered to fly on the shortest of chains. Yet even a child can see its dignity; thimble of bravery, all fluff and brittle bone. Not timid, not even hopeless, but steady and holding its place. Refusing to pull back from the world.” This story begins with an act of terror in modern day New York, but this story could also be said to have started in 1654 when Fabritius, with deft hand, painted his masterpiece, a luminescent bird, a Goldfinch. Theo Decker is a child, with a mother obsessed with art. She frequently would skip buying lunch to have enough money to go to a museum. It is easy to give up food when one is about to nourish the soul. She in particular wants to see and she wants to share that experience with Theo. Donna Tartt is a master of language, but she really excels when she is composing people. This description of Theo’s mother manifested her before me as if she were flesh and blood in the room with me. While at the museum a terrorist bomb explodes at a moment when Theo is separated from his mother. He never sees her again. Somehow in the confusion he walks out with an antique dealer’s ring that was placed in his hands by the dying owner, and the painting, . Theo is placed with his friend Andy’s family for a time. They live on Park Avenue, and though they try their best to make him feel welcome it is impossible for him to ever feel like anything other than a charity case. For all Mrs. Barbour’s money and perceived social power she can not trump one thing...a blood relative. She feels guilty and relieved when Theo’s long gone, long lost, father appears. He has the scent of insurance money in his nose. He has a gambling addiction that rains money when he wins, but when he loses the vig requires a blizzard of money to fix. He sells off everything of his wife’s possessions that can be sold, and hauls Theo out to Las Vegas. His father acted in a handful of bit parts in Hollywood for a few years before washing out. Theo’s father is not interested in parenting any more now than he was when he lived with Theo and his wife. In other words Theo is turned loose allowed to roam, and do whatever he wants to do. Theo meets Boris, a Russian kid with even less supervision than Theo, and falls into a hedonistic lifestyle of drugs and alcohol abuse that will haunt him for the rest of his life. The need to escape becomes a pattern that by necessity has to become more and more creative as he swims his way through a sea of pills and booze into adulthood. I wonder if Tartt’s writing buddy, Bret Easton Ellis, was a consultant for the descriptions of drug use that are sprinkled throughout the novel. Meanwhile follows along with Theo. Before leaving New York Theo returns the ring, that he was given at the museum, to a man named Hobie who turns out to be a business partner of the deceased man. Hobie is a furniture restoring expert. He keeps parts from unsalvageable antiques and uses those pieces to replace damaged sections on salvageable antiques. He also creates new pieces of furniture by marrying filigree to a plain piece as long as the wood dates from the same period. He is an artist. He calls these pieces of furniture his changelings. Theo soon realizes that most people are looking for a deal/steal and he has no difficulty acting the rube to play on their greed. He begins selling these changelings as real antiques. If someone complains he gives their money back and at the same time creates provenance that the antique came from their collection. He uses that provenance to sell the next person. Brilliant, illegal, but brilliant. He meets Pippa, who stays with Hobie from time to time. She was also hurt in the blast at the museum. When circumstances allow him to escape, the hell-hole called Las Vegas, he lands back on Hobie’s doorstep or should I say in much better proximity to Pippa. Oh yeah, he’s got it bad...for life. Pippa is forever linked with his mother, not because she knew his mother, but because she entered his life at the very moment his mother left it. Theo hasn’t been able to bear looking at for a long time. It is an overwhelming cauldron of pain, guilt, beauty, loss, and lust on the order of Gollum’s passion for the One-Ring. If he looks at it too often he will become totally possessed. So there is a painting, stolen, carried all over the country, lost, found, stolen again, and finally found once more. So there is a boy blown up, lost, found, lost, lost, lost, and dare we to hope he is to be found once more? This book is full of beautiful, lyrical language, and a cast of characters that could have competed with a book from the Victorian era. I couldn’t help rooting for Theo in the same way that I rooted for David Copperfield and Oliver Twist. Even when he is surrounded by people, even people that would gladly offer him whatever help he could desire, he is lonely, caught in a cycle of grief that can’t be shared or unburdened. The life he was supposed to have was taken from him, and now he is chained to a bastardized life like Fabitius’s Goldfinch. A life that can never quite be understood, and a life made nearly unbearable by the memory of flight. See more of my writing at You can like my blog page on Facebook here."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"OMG! I took nearly fifteen days to finish this book. (I have to admit that I cheated on it with some sci-fi YA releases and thrillers) Of the reason is 775 pages long journey cut my enthusiasm but at least it wasn’t bored me, I never intended to put it on my dnf list because it was a fabulous Dickensian book, so lyrically, mind-captivating-ly, memorably written. I wish I had the all the time on the earth to full concentrate on this story. Normally reading is the way for me to lose myself in words and I always act like I cannot hear the people blaring to my ears to get my attention! But for this book, I cannot have a luxury to connect with the outer world. I have to grab this one, leave on a helicopter and land on a private island bringing three things with me this book, a case of Chardonnay and my husband’s leftover meatballs( thanks God, one of us can cook and that’s not me!) In three amazing days I could end this book, get drunk, eat decent meal and get an amazing tan. Well, I couldn’t achieve to realize this dream so I finished in 15 days and put more efforts to absorb each word because this book was like a chocolate lava cake for me, I never wanted to finish it and as I dig more I found more layers, new tastes to discover and enjoyed each second till it fully devoured! From the beginning my world rocked because MET is my sanctuary in NY. The bombing of one of the trade-marks of country is one of the effectively shocking ways of starting of a story. Theo Decker loses his mother at the attack and escapes from the explosion, unharmed, with a priceless painting named Goldfinch with him! Theo’s adventure continues at his new home as one of close friends of the family took him to Park Avenue apartment. Takes you to the journey to take a closer look to the Upper West high class elites and the elites with gambling addiction problem! Then you’re moving to Lower East Side drug circles, darkest dens and accidentally found yourself at Vegas suburbs. Then suddenly you open your eyes Amsterdam streets at Christmas. It was depressing, heart-wrenching, hardly absorbing, sad story because every one’s ways to face with the grief and their losses were different. Some people could hardly move on from one of the stages. Denial was the most dangerous stage which resulted with self-harm. Mostly the self-guilt took the rest of strength Theo mustered mostly and forced him to self-harm. What I mostly liked is the genuinely developed characterizations which had significant resemblances with Dickens characters. This book may consist of some references of Great Expectations and I felt like I read some kind of amazing tribute to Dickens’ visualization. Of course Boris was my favorite! I enjoyed it so much but I’m not so sure the adaptation of the story to the big screen will be any good. In my opinion WORDS ARE STRONGER THAN ACTIONS AND IMAGES. Your visualization is always going to be better than what stands in front of you. And some books are not for adaption. Just like this one. So I prefer to skip the movie and later I plan to read this book again to discover different tastes, brand new perspectives and fully enjoy them!"

I don't know where to start in describing my experience of this enormous hunk of enormousness. I came within less than 200 pages of finishing it, but I cannot go on. A brief (and crabby) synopsis of my experience with this book: First 200 pages = This is outrageously excellent! Five stars for sure. Next 200 pages = Getting really sick of Theo and Boris and substance abuse. Four stars, but only if it improves soon. Next 170+ pages = Drudgery. Author has written herself into a corner but trudges doggedly on. Three stars, dropping to two stars, and finally 1.5 stars because I cannot force myself to finish. The days go by, I'm reading 8 or 10 pages a day at most.

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt Life is full of struggle and hardship but the beauty we encounter along the way can make it worth living. ********************************************** by Adrian Coort The Goldfinch ********************************************** One of many the joys of this novel are the visually striking and timeless descriptions of New York City. When the storyline shifts locations to the barren wasteland of suburban Las Vegas, it's a striking contrast. The visuals, characters, and stories are conveyed with such detail that they've became real people to me. Gapstow Bridge in Central Park, Manhattan, New York City The isolation and sprawl of tract housing in the outer suburbs of Las Vegas. ********************************************** There are numerous references and allusions to classic literature woven throughout this book. The most explicit ones are to Dickens (Tartt is a huge fan) and to 19th Century Russian Literature, also known as the Golden Era of Russian literature. Theo is a modern-day Pip (Great Expectations). His artsy mother is named Audrey (Holly Golightly, Breakfast At Tiffany’s). A favorite Central Park bench Theo visits with his mom happens to be the same famous bench that Holden Caulfield visits (The Catcher in the Rye). Hobie is a modern-day Joe Gargery (Great Expectations). He's a kind, gentle man who rehabilitates furniture in a dusty antique shop (The Old Curiosity Shop). Theo's streetwise partner in crime, Boris, is a character reminiscent of The Artful Dodger (Oliver). Part of the book is named after Dostoevsky's novel, The Idiot. Boris spends several paragraphs of the book analyzing ""The Idiot"" and its dark, depressing message about life. Boris gives Theo the nickname ""Potter"" (Harry Potter) another orphan boy who lost his parents. This cute, wholesome reference is a sharp contrast to the lonely bleakness of Theo's life as an orphan. An old, wealthy Manhattan family, the Barbours, personify New York’s posh, upper-class life. They live in a richly decorated Upper West Side apartment stuffed with priceless furniture and large, dark oil paintings of naval battles. (The Age of Innocence, Great Gatsby). Art in almost every form is represented in the book: painting, music, film, cinematography, literature, even antique furniture restoration. I counted 36 works of classic literature referenced in ""The Goldfinch, 24 classic films, 20 iconic paintings, and a dozen iconic musicians and pieces of music. Characters in the book find meaning and purpose in their life through art and the creative process: Hobie through furniture restoration, Pippa through her music, Fabritius through his painting, Donna Tartt through prose. The last 10 pages of the novel pull the themes of the book to the surface. What if you do the wrong things in life, but for the right reasons? How does one differentiate the value v/s price of a work of art? What is the value of authentic work v/s a counterfeit? Life is harsh, cruel and so short; what's the point? Perhaps art gives us hope and helps make life worth living. You decide. Maybe there is no ultimate truth, no transcendent divine experience. Maybe the acts we commit out of love, are beyond good and evil. Perhaps the artist's job is, not to surrender to the emptiness of existence, but to find an antidote to counteract that feeling of emptiness. Maybe hope, even if it is just an illusion, is a reason to continue. Maybe the beauty we encounter in life is what makes it all worth living. It took ten years for Donna Tartt to finish this book. It was worth the wait."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was an exciting book and despite being nearly 900 pages long, was quite a page-turner. The characters were all drawn realistically and with all their flaws (with the possible exception of Hobie who was a lovable sweetheart!) The protagonist, Theo is also our narrator and is fairly reliable as he doesn't hold anything back - even his own many faults. The external narrative is on the fate of the painting The Goldfinch by Fabritius (about which we learn its own turbulent history and extreme genius throughout the narrative) following the explosion on page 34 and how this impacted Theo's life. The painting actually plays a very background position over most of the narrative and only comes centerstage again at the end of the book. Theo makes a lot of poor choices - unfortunately his father's sleazy girlfriend Xandra was right that he is far more like his father than he is willing to admit and yet in some of the best passages in the book, towards the end where Boris talks about Dosto's The Idiot: We know that despite Theo's tendency towards his dad, he is nonetheless a more genuine person and that Boris with all his external show of bravado - and of course his one big betrayal of Theo - he turns out to also to precisely the surprising but right thing in the end. It is to Tartt's credit that the book contained so much detail (and none of it boring or pedantic) about furniture, art, and literature (driving me crazy I cannot place the turning point scene in La Recherche between Swann and Odette that she refers to) which added a lot more depth and interest to the book. Personally, I think the length was fine - she had a lot of story to tell and did an excellent job telling. I love at the end also where Theo is traveling and tells us that one of the lessons he learned from Hobie was: ...those images that strike the heart and set it blooming like a flower, images that open up some much, much larger beauty that you can spend your whole life looking for and never find. I found that to be a beautiful image and full of truth - like Plato's cave. Yet, another apt and thought-provoking insight from this rich and thought-provoking masterpiece. This was one time that the Pulitzer nailed it. On a side note, I made my own trek to the Mauritshuis museum in Den Haag years ago when reading Proust to see Vermeer's View of Delft and the Girl with the Pearl Earring but either the painting was traveling or I drifted right past it towards Rembrandt. Guess I need to return to the Hague! Her other two books were good, but this one was the best. I was in Den Haag at the wonderful Mauritshuis Museum and saw (again) the original Fabritius painting - absolutely stunning. Interesting tidbit: months after painting The Goldfinch, the artist and most of his work was blown up when the building his studio was in exploded. The film for this book is just coming out, hopefully, it will do the book some justice. And apparently, it was terrible. Oh well. On a second read, the book was just as awesome. Definitely one of my favorite books of the 2010s and the best Pulitzer winner of that decade!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Donna Tartt's latest novel has left this reader relatively unimpressed, especially considering the fact that she's author of The Secret History - a successful and popular novel which resulted in an entire generation of books which tried to be like it - and has reportedly spent 10 years writing The Goldfinch, which could very well be true, since she has written exactly three books in three decades. Understandably, her new novel became the object of much anticipation and when it was finally released it did so to rave reviews, with Stephen King calling it ""an extraordinary work of fiction"" and even the notoriously harsh Michiko Kakutani was charmed, and called the novel ""dazzling"". I confess to be genuinely puzzled by all the positive reviews, as the book that I've read overly long, very disjointed and overall surprisingly clumsy, considering the time it took to complete. This is a story which has all the potential of being great but is simply not told very well, and ultimately collapses under its own weight. Tartt begins with what should have been a classic Hitchcock trick, but - thanks to the blurb which reveals it in advance - never even had a chance. Theo Decker - the main protagonist and narrator - is a 13 year old boy who is visiting New York's Metropolitan Art Museum with his mother, where they're viewing an exhibition of Renaissance Dutch art. Theo is charmed by a young girl who is visiting the museum with an elderly man, and wants to look at her a bit more, prompting his mother to go and take a look at her favorite paintings. Just after she disappears a bomb explodes, turning the museum and exhibition into rubble and dust. Theo miraculously survives, and notices that the elderly man he saw just minutes ago is dying - but manages to call Theo, and gives him his ring with an address. Theo sees him pointing at a painting which somehow has escaped unscathed, freed from its frame by the explosion, and understands that the man wants him to save it. The painting is a famous one - its Carel Fabritius's , a favorite of his mother's. Theo decides to take it and leaves the museum, later learning that she was killed in the blast. Theo can't cope with the fact - he and his mother have been very close since his abusive father has left the family several years ago. Effectively orphaned and scared by the prospect of living with elderly and uncaring relatives which the social service agents want to impose on him, Theo manages to secure temporary residence with his friend Andy and his family - the Barbours. He suffers from survivor's guilt, blaming himself for his mother's tragic death and can't imagine having to live without her. Tartt takes her time to illustrate Theo's misery and slow recovery from grief as he lives with the Barbour family - a group stunted and odd in their own way. Until one day Theo's father unexpectedly shows up with his girlfriend, and takes Theo to live with them in their house in Las Vegas. This is the point where the novel loses its ground and never regains it. Theo's father - a gambler who walks on the thin rope hanging over the great ocean of casinos, filled with loan sharks - and his girlfriend, Xandra, who is not sure what to make of Theo. They're both interesting characters but remain woefully underused and undeveloped - there's a glimmer of a great plot involving Theo's father and his experiences with those who run the Casinos which is then literally and quite unceremoniously dropped, and remains unresolved for hundreds of pages - and when it finally is mentioned again you almost wish that it was forgotten altogether, since the way Tartt ""solved"" it is truly that lame. A total cop-out and a shame, as it essentially ended what could be a fascinating part of the book. Also, when did the setting stop being important? After being treated to minutiae descriptions of New York and its environs, Las Vegas is basically skimmed over - all we learn about it is the fact that it's in the middle of a desert and that its full of scorching sunlight. The adjective ""Dickensian"" gets used a lot in reviews of this book, but I don't think its deserved - unless a novel whose main character is an orphan somehow becomes ""Dickensian"" by association (to Tartt's credit she inserts a literal Old Curiosity Shop with a Kindly Older Guardian Figure into the book too). Since Theo can be seen as a contemporary Oliver Twist, here enters the charismatic character who will play his Artful Dodger - a Ukrainian teenager named Boris. Boris is the type of character which can only exist in fiction, and is a rather cartoonish composite of various stereotypes that Westerners have about Russians, Ukrainians and other Slavic people (at least his name isn't Ivan). Boris is a character who does not stay away from alcohol an drugs (of course), and has a rich father who unfortunately is also an abusive alcoholic (I think we've seen that before). Boris also deals with drugs and has connection to the underworld (I guess the usual poor black teenager drug dealers wouldn't be exotic enough), but in reality is a genius (when sober) who is able to converse in several languages, has seen half the planet (his homeland ranks the lowest - of course), and reads Dostoevsky and other ambitious literature in original in his spare time, when not drugged out of his mind. In the real world it simply does not happen - you'd be surprised to see how quickly irresponsibility combined with drugs can extinguish the brightest of fires. Boris's cartoonishness comes as a weird contrast to Theo, whom Tartt tried to portray realistically and convincingly. The antics of both Boris and Theo make me lose whatever sympathy I could have had for him - he was a whiny and uninteresting kid, but anyone would be a little shaken if their mom exploded. But neither he or Boris are Dickensian characters. Dickens wrote about orphaned children who struggled through life, but they struggled against the condition the world threw them into. Oliver Twist ends up with Fagin because he was swayed by the Artful Dodger, who himself knew no other life. Pip in strives to be a gentleman to impress Estella, whom he pursues. Contrary to that, both Theo and Boris openly embrace the squalor and disintegration, reveling in drug-fueled stupidity, antics and parties. There is no warm humor so familiar to anyone who has ever read a Dickens novel, and not even an shade of anything which could have passed for a portion of his wit. The novel then moves back to New York, and then across the seas to Amsterdam - in a sequence of events which would suggest that Tartt came up with a series of ideas for several novels and tried to connect them all into a great, big one, which didn't work out. There is even a love story here, but the love interest is nothing more but a prop used to make it happen - she's not fleshed out to be a real person, and is made to look like a forever unreachable mysterious pixie girl. The painting which Theo took from the museum - the - is forgotten for hundreds of pages until it is suddenly mentioned again, and what should have been a major issue in the book - will Theo ever get rid of it, and if he does - how? - gets ""solved"" in what has to be one of the most anticlimatic resolutions of contemporary literature. In her review Kakutani has admitted that Tartt's sequence of events are highly improbable, but wrote that startling coincidences and sudden reversals of fortune is just Tartt being adept at . I call bullshit and say that this is just an excuse for lazy and incompetent plotting. A plethora of impossible coincidences shouldn't be so easily accepted - Dickens wrote his novel in installments for newspapers, prety much making the story up as he went on. Sometimes he ran himself into a corner an had to resort to an impropable chain of events - but then he had a week to publish the next chapter of his novel, while Tartt had ten years. The novel picks up the pace in the last third, which is the tightest and most frenetic part of the book...until it arrives at the conclusion, which is when I began to wonder if Tartt wrote it with a straight face and if the hundreds of pages were not a simple buildup to one giant prank. The ending of is worthy of a hungover Paulo Coehlo phoning it in on a bad day, and contains the worst of pompous maudlinism disguised as revelation. It feels tacked-on as an afterthought, and makes the reader wonder if the character is consciously engaging in pseudo-intellectual posturing or is genuinely one of the biggest blockheads in contemporary literature. Ultimately, is a disappointing book - especially considering the wait time and all the hype that surrounded it. I gave it an extra start for Donna Tartt's writing - she does have a talent for constructing nice sentences here and there - but it does not warrant the 800 pages that it is printed on. Like the saying goes - a picture paints a thousand words, but thousands of words couldn't paint this picture."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Donna Tartt is one of America’s greatest living male writers. She has taken a form of novel - the doorstopper, the tome, the phonebook - and taken something away from it that is has often never been without: the penis. In this ritual castration of the ‘opus’ Tartt has managed to completely free it from all its ills. DeLillo, Franzen, Foster Wallace, Pynchon, Mailer, all kneel there, bloodied and shorn like Goya etchings, John Bobbitts by any other name, weak and utterly defeated. Whilst Donna, looking like what Timothée Chalamet will eventually become, stands defiant, a bouquet of dicks in hand, laughing. Carel Fabritius’ 1654 trompe-l’œil is an odd little painting. Fabritius only uses about 40% of the canvas for his painting of the little bird. The rest is a sea of nothing, but it’s enjoyable nothing. Donna Tartt’s 2013 novel is an odd little book. Tartt only uses about 40% of the novel for the plot and its development. The rest is a sea of nothing, but it’s enjoyable nothing. People over this book when it came out. Absolutely soiled themselves. I scarcely recall any other book in the five years since came out that has had anywhere near the same amount of complete domination. I mean, it was all, of course, deserved. No other writer has written anything like this since, nor has anyone even tried. It must have been like when Michelangelo did the and every other artist in Renaissance-era Italy was like ‘well fuck me right!? fuck MY still lives’. I didn’t read it at the time. I was still disillusioned by how much I did not enjoy . I know, I know, I didn’t like . I think it was because I actually saw of myself in the characters, and they’re all detestable. A similar thing happened with Eugenides’ , a fucking awful novel full of characters just like me. People often complain about never seeing themselves in books, my problem is I can’t seem to escape myself. And I found myself again in . In Theo. This time it didn’t cause me to throw the book across the room however. I mean, Theo insufferable. Everything about him just reeks, really. But god is he loveable. The broken male teen. Holden Caulfield . Then there’s also Hobie. Ah Hobie. Sweet, clueless Hobie. I will do everything in my power to protect you. Plot-wise we’re a bit fast and loose here aren’t we? That Vegas bit went on didn’t it? And the entire second-half? Whew. Michi Kakutani was jumping over herself with the Dickens comparisons in the NYT. But you really couldn’t be farther from Dickens. The thing with Dickens was it was plot. You could never say nothing happens in Dickens, if anything too many things happen. Also she compares Theo to Pip when he’s David Copperfield. I’m glad she retired. Anyway this is meant to be a review of isn’t it? Eh, yeah, it’s great. I really loved it. Patchy. But great. Some bits needed polishing. But great. Couple characters could’ve been cut. But great. The whole marriage thing? But great. Also I’ve decided to give another go. I feel the problem is me. Not the book. But can eat my entire ass."

I've been looking for a while to read an American masterpiece (by my tastes) and I finally found it. I believe it totally deserves the Pulitzer Prize. This book has almost everything. Beautiful prose and flow of the words and the story, Donna Tartt is wonderful. It is gripping but in an unexpected way. At the beginning of the book the action is quite static. However, I could not wait to get home everyday and read a few more pages. The pace picks up at the end, I read the last 200 pages in one go. It has suspense,adventure, love, drugs, Russian gangsters, gambling, art etc. But most of all this book is about suffering, loss and incapability ( unwillingness) of the main character to be happy. His torments, his addictions for drugs or love and his journeys out of addiction are very hauntingly presented. Anyways, even if it is not an easy read in terms of some of the subjects touched it is definitely worth it."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Update again: Thoughts on the movie: (opened today in our area) >>> just saw it! If you have not read the book -- the movie might be confusing. Its VERY SLOW --VERY LONG -- It didn't transfer to the big screen well. Donna Tartt's book is brilliant -- the movie much less so. Yet--I'm still glad I saw it. A few things work! My suggest to people going to see it --KNOWING it won't be as good as the book -(its definitely not) - is to PLAN on sitting back for almost 3 hours (It feels like 3 hours anyway: but its not quite that long) -- Go into a meditative type space -- RELAX.... you can't rush the movie --It won't speed up just because you want it to. I had a cold drink to sip -- and enjoyed my lounging seat...and just surrendered into the slow moving length of the film. Theo --the main character in The Goldfinch is NOT my favorite actor in the film. His friend, Boris is. The casting for Boris was EXCELLENT.... The casting for YOUNG Theo was 'off' in my opinion. Did we really need another main kid to look like Harry Potter? I think not!!! The older Theo was better. Nicole Kidman was fine in her role. The old man of the antique shop was perfect in his role. Also - the antique shop was visually great. The best visual that totally fit the way I visualized it in the book were the houses in Las Vegas. Those homes were 'exactly' as I pictured it. The movie does not move in the same chronological order as the book. It jumps around--backward- forward - young Theo - and old Theo. The clothes were good -- fitting with the times -- The bombing special effects in the museum -- (done as flashbacks) - were done well -- but I would have preferred it to have followed the chronological order of the book -- Its very effective in the book -- a little on the late side in the movie. so-- overall --not great -- but I'm glad I saw it. SLOW.....expect 'very' slow in the beginning -- We get use to the slow pace after about an hour into it....haha! Others? Your thoughts on the movie? Love to hear your take -- I LOVED the kid who played Boris!!! Absolutely my favorite actor in the film!! UPDATE.... I read this 6 years ago -- (in 4 days if my memory is correct). I remember where I sat --my feelings -- and later my local book club gathering-discussion. I read and wrote this six year old review before it won The Pulitzer Prize. I'm seeing the movie Friday afternoon. Anyone else going this Friday --or over the week-end? Maybe we can all chat about the movie?/! --- compared to the book! :) AMAZING!!! My personal FAVORITE book of the year!!! The story was delicious! The writing WONDERFUL! I've picked some of Donna Tartt's writing to share that I deeply enjoyed: 1) On page 335: ""We looked at each other and just laughed; everything was hysterically funny, even the playground slide was smiling at us, and at some point, deep in the night, when we were swinging on the jungle gym and showers of sparks were flying out of our mouths, I had an epiphany that laughter was light, and light was laughter, and that this was a secret of the universe. For hours we watched the clouds rearranging themselves into intelligent patterns; rolled in the dirt, believing it was seaweed (!); lay on our backs and sing ""Dear Prudence"" to the welcoming and appreciating stars. It was a fantastic night -- one of the great nights of my life, actually, despite what happened later."" WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIGHT????? 2) ""Me --well, maybe I didn't have a girlfriend or even any non-drug friends to speak of but I worked twelve hours a day, nothing stressed me out, I wore Thom Brown suits, socialized smilingly with people I could not stand, swam twice a week and played tennis on occasion, stayed away from sugar and processed foods. I was relaxed and personable, I was thin as a rail, I was an excellent salesman -- everyone said so -- and business was so good that what I spent on drugs, I scarcely missed."" I STILL LAUGH just TYPING that SENTENCE! This author --IMO ---is EXCEPTIONAL --beyond EXCEPTIONAL!!! I'm in 'aw'!!!! I wish I could thank her for the incredible experience I had with her book!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Whaaaaat? Am I reading a different book from all of you people giving this five stars? I am halfway through this pretentious, nonsensical, self-indulgent, ridiculous THING, and I'm only forcing myself to finish because I paid $40 for this monstrosity. It is unconvincing on so many levels. Theo Decker does not ring true. He doesn't SOUND like a boy, for a start, and I'm hard-pressed to believe a thirteen-year old reads and understands the likes of Chekov, Thoreau and Emmerson. And why doesn't Theo have a cellphone? Tartt seems reluctant to accept that her book is set in the 21st century- even the laptop is locked away in his Dad's bedroom so emails are sparse- so why not set it in 1962 or somewhere more plausible? And Boris- what a ridiculous, implausible character: a polyglot who has lived all around the world in his fifteen years, had dazzling adventures, survived regular beatings from his equally unlikely father, spends a good part of his life starving and/or drunk, and has found time to read Chekov in Russian. His Soviet-flavoured lectures on the virtues of stealing only from faceless corporations make him sound like he's fifty. Every other character I've encountered so far is as flat as the paper its printed on. Mrs Barbour: aloof, icy Society Matron. Theo's dad: Bad Parent,only cares about money. Xandra (With an X, which takes about 200 words to explain):Trailer-Park Whore with a wee soft spot for furry animals.The Latino Doormen: Latino Doormen. Hobie: Dumbledore. The plot limps along. After the initial set-up (Mum dies in a bomb blast at an art museum and Theo washes up an almost-orphan, which takes forever), things just slope along with no real tension, mystery or sense of purpose to drive you from one page to the next. And EVERYTHING- each object, setting, conversation, item of clothing, facial feature, crack in the sidewalk, cloud in the sky,item of furniture,swirl of vomit in the toilet bowl - EVERYTHING thing is described in minute and tedious detail, irrespective of its relevance to anything at bloody all. I skipped whole pages I could see were going nowhere. Boris and Theo get drunk again and have a fight? Woohoo! Boris gets the bash from his dad? So what- nothing happens as a consequence, and the boys carry on like two washed up old tramps from a Beckett play - oh, but pardon me for dropping in a pretentious and pointless literary allusion to a text read by no thirteen-year-ever.Or to every orphan story every written- Harry Potter, Great Expectations, Huck Finn (who Boris is supposed to be I suppose). It's probably meant to be terribly clever but just seems obvious. And another thing. Dialogue is peppered with question marks at the end of sentences which aren't questions. I suppose it's to indicate an upward vocal inflection? Like how teens speak? It's silly and irritating. Sigh. I suppose there is some symbolic MEANING to the painting of the goldfinch and I suppose the girl with the red hair will reappear sometime to break Theo's heart (if he's not gay, which it sort of sounds like he is)- but there is no urgency, no ticking clock, nothing to make me care one way or another. 300 pages to go. Wish me luck. *UPDATE* I finished it. Tempted to increase the rating to two stars because it does improve a little halfway through- at least the plot picks up. There is a PROBLEM all of a sudden (the missing element in the first half), which makes things a little interesting, if no more believable. I was right about the girl (so too predictable) and almost right about the other thing. But (Spoiler Alert)- how is it remotely possible that Theo would not have heard of the death of Andy and (silly name) Chase? Did he not read a paper or watch the news for eight years? They were New York Society, so their sudden demise would hardly go unremarked. And Boris's reappearance is just too coincidental. And the relationship issue: again, not at all believable. Surely Kitsey /Cutesy can make up her own mind about a man and not choose one just to please Mummy, especially knowing he is a total stoner. The endless drug-taking is really tedious too. But back to the Problem; here's the problem with the Problem. The solution to the Problem is so simple, so easy, so obvious and so anti-climactic that it should have occurred to everyone two hundred pages earlier and saved me several hours of my life I'll never get back. And the ending- oh spare me- fifty-something pages that go on, and on, and on about Beauty and Art and Meaning. Which is all very noble and true I guess but so many others have said the same thing so much better, in fewer words. Still one star."

At 400 pages the book could have been excellent. Even at 500 pages the book had a likely chance of being very good. But at an astonishing 718 pages the book was overconfident in its own beauty, wisdom and dare I say its worthwhileness. I had four different experiences of reading this book: 15% of it was absolutely sublime, profound, beautiful, profoundly beautifuly, beautifully sublime. You get the picture. There were moments when I was so choked with emotion that the boyfriend would pass me tissues as soon as he heard a sniffle. The loss of Theo's mother, his love of Hobie and Pippa, the comfort of the Goldfinch, the restrained desire for Boris and a few other emotional moments. These moments were poignant, heavy with gorgeousness and clearly unforgettable. 50% was like watching an art house film by Gregg Araki mixed with reruns of Melrose Place. I know this sounds strange but this is exactly what this was like for me. Truly entertained but rather numbing and in the end extraneous. 20% was gently trying to cajole Ms. Tartt (telepathically) to please cut out huge sections of the book that were superfluous, exhausting and unnecessary. 15% siliently and sometimes not so silently cursing Ms. Tartt for the written diarrhea that one has to go through until you get to another one of those absolutely stunning sections that were written about above. Ms. Tartt when you are ""on"" you are ""bang on"" but please please please find another editor."

It’s a secret whisper from an alleyway. Psst, you. Hey kid. Yes you."" Finally!! This book! I put off reading Donna Tartt for far too long. This book in particular was on and off my list for quite some time. I can’t say why really. Call me capricious, I guess. Then in November 2019, I read and kicked myself for not having read Tartt sooner. On finishing that superb work of literature, I knew I’d pick this one up at long last. For once my dawdling paid off though. I couldn’t have picked a more perfect time to read this most excellent novel! Last week, I was supposed to be in New York City for the first time in ages, having last been there on a field trip with a bunch of fellow teens. This was a vacation I was so highly anticipating. There would be trips to the theater, the Met, and Central Park. I was going to stuff myself with as much ethnic cuisine as I could possibly handle without making myself sick. AND… I would be visiting the Strand Book Store for the very first time!! Well, as they say, the best-laid plans… How very sorry I was to have to cancel this trip; how even more heartsick I was to hear of the devastation in that vibrant city as the result of something virtually invisible yet so deadly as this damn virus that has shut down the entire world. One consolation until this evil is eradicated – . It was a life saver for me, as books so often are. Plus, I got to indirectly spend a good chunk of time in NYC immersed in these pages. There are plenty of other fabulous reviews out there if you are interested in gleaning a bit more about the plot. I’m just going to say that this book has it all, really. First and foremost, the prose is exceptional. I’m all about the writing these days. Secondly, these are wholly believable characters, full of imperfections just like real people. Even when I didn’t agree with many of their actions, I never felt that Tartt was asking us to judge them. I never felt the need to judge them; I rooted for them no matter those flaws. I can see where Theo Decker might be a bit of a turnoff to some readers. For me, however, there was something about him that just crushed me and drew me to him. I guess you could say, I understood him, despite our superficial differences. There was something at the core of him that gnawed away at my heart. And then there was Theo’s best friend, Boris. This guy! Sometimes I wanted Theo to get as far away as possible from him and other times I was wishing him right back with us. Mostly, he made me smile. Wise Hobie and the lovely Pippa definitely won me over. The settings are brilliantly illustrated – from the vitality of New York City to the dust and depravity of Las Vegas to the charm of Amsterdam. Of course, there is a cleverly plotted storyline that made this another step up from just your everyday ‘good’ book. Despite its length coming in at over 775 pages, I was captivated in its entirety. There’s too much to say about this masterpiece - more things I could say about the meaning of art, about the choices we make, about love and death. About life. I was completely consumed by the ending pages. I couldn’t help but think of this novel in terms of our current situation. For this reason, I believe it will forever hold an extra special place in my heart. I have one more full-length Tartt novel to delight in. It will take a lot of willpower not to rush to it right away! is headed to my favorites shelf."

Congratulations, Ms. Tartt on such a stunning return. The Goldfinch is a doorstopper, weighing in at over 700 densely written pages. Yet, I found myself tearing through it as if I couldn't read it fast enough. I don't know what the secret is to Ms. Tartt's prose, but I dig it. I dig it a lot. Maybe it's due to sheer deprivation (absence making the heart grow fonder and all that jazz), because this lady, while her talent goes undisputed, has only managed to pen three novels in three decades -- the very antithesis of James Patterson (whom I wish would just go away -- how many trees have to die for you, Jim? HOW MANY?) I can be a real sucker for a sense of place. Tartt writes New York in such a way that I was able to feel the thrum of traffic and smell the bakeries (and the sewers). Taxis, doormen, park benches, museums, lunch counters -- all swirling together in a portrait that's as carefully rendered as any artist's painting. When she transplants readers to the parched and desolate Las Vegas suburbs, I became just as enthralled by the startling contrast between bustling city and dry desert. There's really not much to say here other than I became totally immersed in this book while I was reading it. It's a character-driven piece in the sense that it's without an intricate plot, or Big Reveals. But oh, what characters! All the feels! It was just such a heartening experience to get to know them all and watch them hurl through life together, for better and for worse. It's the characters from which we draw the tension and the pace of the story and it's all so deftly handled by Ms. Tartt that I'm actually left floundering for ways to adequately describe it. So I won't. Let her take you on this journey and I'll get the hell out of the way."

(p679) Big hyperbolic opening. I have been to the Himalayas, Easter Island, Neptune, and Dundee, and never have I encountered words on the page that have rocked me to the core of my deep deep soul as this. I have kissed Cardinal Ratzinger’s mitre, Warren Zevon’s left pinkie, and Liam Neeson’s elbows, had five marriages and nine divorces, but nothing in my whole entire life compares to when I sat down and read this big-because-the-font-is-huge doorstop that everyone else loves and W.H. Smith agrees is a masterpiece. Now for the strange, shrink-ready “personal” response. Emotions can be emotional. We can gaze into our souls and find dark things there, like old bananas or burnt toast. Sometimes overcoming struggle can be a struggle and we need the love of loved ones to help us overcome the emotional struggles with our loved ones. Out hearts beat like metronomes alongside the hearts of everyone else on the planet’s hearts, which beat similarly, unless they have stopped. Those people are dead. Our families can be terrible and drive us to do crazy things, like burn down the house and run off with a My Chemical Romance groupie who leaves us penniless in the pub toilets after taking our virginity. It is reassuring to know that there are always people there for us, if we have enough mobile credit and remember the hotline to the Samaritans. Further exaggeration as to how this book changed my life, without ever getting into the specifics. The characters. The plot. The words. The pages. These have reshaped the entire structure of my life and will sit deep inside my heart forever, until the next book comes along that does the same thing and offers me the same reaction and I write the same review but with different swooning self-important waffle that is really about ME and MY LIFE and not really about the book at all, and shows that these books are never really appreciated for their artistry, but for the way they appear to touch our lives and appeal to the feelings and emotions we think we have that make us good people, when we aren’t too busy going about the everyday business of gratifying ourselves and never demonstrating one tenth of this well-deep so-called love-of-the-world by being kind to a person we haven’t allowed into our private little bubble of pre-tested and pre-approved people. Read this because I am more important than all of you. Now give me my 1,829 likes and I will ignore your comments except the ones that say how amazing I am."

I was looking for a well written, character driver page turner and I found it in this novel. It begins with Theo Decker a 13 y/o New Yorker who miraculously survives an explosion in an art museum, his mother dies in the explosion. He meets an older man who gives him a ring and tells him to ""just ring the doorbell"" and also tells him to take the painting that is on the wall. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He lives on Park Avenue an has trouble now assimilating into this new culture. Then his father returns and he is forced to live with him and his new wife in Las Vegas. He has a very strange few years there with one friend, Boris, who will appear again in a very important way in his adult life, so pay close attention! As an adult Theo moves from the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques store where he works. The painting places him at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The novel is mesmerizing with energy, power and vivid characters. There is at times harrowing suspense. **This is one of my all time favorite books. At 770 pages it may be too long for some but it was definitely worth the time. I always thought this would make a great movie !!"

At times I needed to take a break, because it was just so heavy (both physically and metaphorically) some of the themes and thoughts the main character had were so awful, I was feeling depressed just to read it! Not that it was all bad, there was plenty that wasn’t as dark. But the overriding themes were just so tough. Theo’s Mum dies in a bomb explosion in the museum in New York, so he is forced to move to Las Vegas and live with his dad, a recovering alcoholic with a now severe gambling addiction. Theo’s time here, though only 15 years old is rife with alcohol and more drugs than you’ve ever seen! He and his best friend Boris were seriously messed up. Theo has been carrying with him a painting stolen from the museum where his mum died. The Goldfinch, worth so much it is actually priceless, given to him by a dying man. When Theo returns to New York he stays with the old partner of the dying man, Hobie, in the antiques shop they ran together. Theo and Hobie run the business together, all the while Theo still has The Goldfinch hidden. No one knows he has it - or do they? This is an epic tale spanning decades of Theo’s life, it covers so much ground, but I finished it not feeling overly satisfied and there were times I was really pushing myself through. Glad I’ve read it, but I definitely need something lighter now as this book was not great for my mental state."

Where's the innovation, 2014's Oracle? This is a marble cake novel (the parts are extremely long, but, yes, contrasting enough to be, well, readable), & something a tad... unspecial.

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I’m told that mine is the deciding vote to establish this book’s place in history: masterpiece or meh. Well, I’ve given myself a week to think about it, and the fact that I did think about it skews it to the positive. But then the equivocator in me recognizes that controversial books often have strong pluses minuses to consider. Here are the factors as I see them. Plenty happens to make this more than just navel fixation. Thirteen-year-old New York City kid, Theo, had one good parent (a mom who genuinely cared for him) and one bad one (a booze hound who had abandoned them). Then, soon after Theo’s mom described what was special to her about the goldfinch painting they were looking at, a bomb went off in the museum and he lost his good one. Dazed, and before he learned of his mother’s fate, he heard the dying wishes of an antique dealer who had been there with his niece Pippa. Theo’s original optimism that he and his mom would soon be reunited gave way to the agonizing truth, and he had to scramble to avoid foster care. He ended up in the posh digs of a nerdy friend from school who had been a co-target of bullying earlier when they both skipped a grade. Theo was still reeling from his loss, but did manage to deliver an heirloom to the shop where the antique dealer had told him to go. There he met one of the kindest characters in all of litdom, a much needed ally named Hobie, along with Pippa who was recovering from the museum trauma. My rule in reviews is not to reveal more about the plot than what the inside flap does, so the only thing I’ll add is that Theo soon finds himself on the outskirts of Las Vegas, the object of indifferent (at best) child care, but able to survive when he teams up with a fellow hard luck case named Boris who could swear in multiple Eastern European languages and was wise to the ways of the world. Like any pulsating storyline, this one keeps the pages turning. (+) I googled “Tartt Goldfinch Dickensian” and came up with 62,300 hits. So yes, people have noticed the hardship. In and of itself, the gloom could be a (+) or a (-), but it tipped negative for me when the conflict, at times, felt contrived. And it was relentless. I was hoping the law of averages would give poor Theo a break every once in a while. To be fair I should mention that my misery tolerance may be compromised by the weather we’ve been having. (-) The problem for me was not in Theo’s choices per se, but how inconsistent they sometimes seemed given his intellect, character and street smarts. At the same time, I have to remember how young he was when made many of them, and how leery a virtual orphan is apt to be to trust anyone in a position to help. (+/-) Beauty, love, good vs. evil – as a big sprawling book, this one took its time and developed its notions well. I give extra credit, too, for the natural way philosophical conversations grew out of the story. When Hobie opined about what constitutes beauty and what its role is in our lives, his thoughts are backed by the long hours he spent restoring antique furniture. And when Boris talks about situational ethics, it’s with an insightful and accessible perspective from his own sordid past and from all the Dostoevsky he’s read. There were even moments of profundity that no doubt earn it literary plaudits. (+) The Fabritius painting titled the same as the book is, not surprisingly, central to the story. It was analyzed and praised, its history was explained in detail, and Theo, as he narrated, recognized it as a metaphor, citing the small bird’s bravery to keep plugging away despite being chained to his perch. In fact, throughout the book there is a heightened artistic sensitivity. Theo went into the antiques business with a good eye for aesthetics. He also learned more than he might have liked about the art underworld. (+) Theo had issues, but he came by them in a plausible and understandable way. I felt way more empathy than antipathy for him. One of the harder things he had to deal with was a rather nasty pill habit. Given his heredity, his influences (primarily Boris) and the harshness of his early life, we don’t judge so much as relate. The book was also credible about the feelings Theo had for Pippa, whom he had idealized from a young age. (+) It long. And dense, too. That said, I was not so much bored as just ready to move on. Other books I got for Christmas were burning holes through the shelf. (-) I guess in a way I’ve buried the lead: Donna Tartt writes really well. I heard she took a full decade to put this together, and it shows. The prose is crisp and refined; the research was first-rate; and her characters, even the minor ones, are nuanced and memorable. As a very small quibble, I sometimes felt like she would choose a slightly wrong word for a male narrator to use, but that was an increasingly rare feeling the more she drew me in to the story. The descriptions were the kind you wonder, thinking back, how such sharp pictures are etched in your mind when you never noticed any long passages that would have given them to you. I got that feeling several times, most noticeably when she described the antique shop where Hobie lived, the shell of a home in suburban Vegas, and the otherworldliness of Amsterdam (or at least of its underbelly). (+) Weighing the pluses and minuses puts this at a solid 4 stars for me. Despite wishing I could have finished it faster, the characters and great writing are likely to be the memories that last."

Yet another great work with near perfect prose, style and tone. And as for the opening scene, it's one you'll never forget - it will blow your mind! Tartt seems unable to do any wrong when, or however she puts ink on paper! 9 out 12. and that's being extremely conservative. The momentous event at the start of this read, forever changed the life of Theo Decker at aged 13, and this tells his story as a directionless and essentially traumatised boy growing up in New York with a substitute family of sorts and how a painting 'The Goldfinch' plays a leading role in his early and young adult life. The genius, in my opinion, of this work has two main points; (1.) this is a read with a number of brain shattering all-consuming highs that are integral to the book making it un-put-downable... yet somehow there are equally as many subtle low-level reveals or supposedly minor incidents that are just as momentous and also make the book un-put-downable! (2.) on not one single occasion was I able to guess what was going to happen next, it was so refreshing to read a seemingly truly original story where the story had a life of it's own, so unpredictable yet so real, at at times unsettling. This was also my first ever 'book club' read... what a fabulous entry into the world of book clubs for me!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The first 600 pages of this book are a gripping read. Tartt creates sympathetic protagonists that you want to root for and fast-paced adventures and predicaments in which you want to see them succeed. Tartt owes a great debt to Dickens in the story's plot, characters, and pathos. Theo Decker is shockingly and suddenly orphaned one ordinary day after a bomb rips through the Metropolitan Museum and his mother perishes while admiring her favorite paintings. Of course, she was beautiful, smart, and possessed of a heart of gold. His father, on the other hand, is a charming con artist who has abandoned them to live with another woman in Las Vegas. Theo has high and low adventures (hopscotching from a tony apartment on the Upper East Side with the blue-blooded Barbours to a seedy desert neighborhood in Las Vegas after his father shows up to reclaim him). Tartt is adept at creating vivid scenes and landscapes (her descriptions of Las Vegas' arid beauty are gorgeous), but she has a tendency to fall back on familiar (and sometimes, cliched) stereotypes. Of course, the Barbours are troubled in that particularly WASP-y, repressed way. Of course, his new Russian pal, Boris, reads Dostoevsky and cynically pontificates on life and politics while waving his arms about and drinking vodka. And of course, his eventual savior and guardian, Hobie, comes with an alluring ward who will forever haunt him and claim his love, a la Estella in Great Expectations. I really enjoyed the first 600 pages of the novel. I thought Tartt revealed a lot about modern America and what it means to be successful (or striving) in America today as she unfurled the brisk plot. However, the last 100-150 pages, with its metaphysical and existential pontificating, did little to advance the plot and ultimately caused me to become less invested in the book and its characters. That is unfortunate, since I was rooting for Theo, Boris, and Pippa right up until the very end."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"2.5 Stars Goldfinch by Donna Tartt is one of those books that not only are you investing your hard earned money in you are investing a huge amount of reading time as this novel has just under 790 pages. I rarely read novels that are more than 600 pages and if I do they really need to hold my interest and I have to be honest Goldfinch was a very long drawn out novel and the plot failed to impress me although I did finish the book but this was more out of my ability to stick with it than any great interest in how it would end. There is a lot to admire about the novel as the writing is excellent and the characters are very well drawn and the sense of time and place is excellent. The first 100 pages were extremely well written and I was really engrossed with the story but then it just dragged on and on for me from there. I probably would have loved this novel if it was about two/three hundred pages shorter. I really disliked constant reference to drugs in the story and I understand they belonged in the book but I got fed up of long descriptions of drug taking and types of drugs throughout the story. I was actually disappointed with how little the story was about the painting in the end. The book fell down for me on the plot, just too many pages and not enough drama. I know others have loved this book but this review is only my opinion and I would advise reading some of the 4/5 star reviews before deciding."

Something that seems to happen more and more frequently lately. But watch out, here comes the knee: There's five hours of my life I'll never get back. God in heaven, can we spell overwritten? Along about page 400 I conducted an experiment--could I read a sentence a page and still understand what was going on? Yes, I could. If ever a book needed an editor with a red pencil, this book was it. If ever an author needed a remedial course in Strunk and White, Tartt is her. Omit needless words! There is some good writing here and there and some scenes that made me smile [describing Mrs. Barbour's antique-laden home] and some lines where I didn't know what the hell she meant but were interesting to think about but they're all so swamped in Tartt's verbal diarrhea that you're drowning before you can really appreciate them. There are also waaaaay too many on-the-nose observations, especially at the end Obvious much? What worries me most is that because it won the Pulitzer, it's now going to be forced on millions of high school students in lit classes, who will conclude that if is what is considered good writing, they'll pass, thanks.

Hell, maybe the best book I've ever read. I use the term 'read' but what I really mean is 'heard' as I listened to this tale via an Audible recording. It's a spectacular reading of a spellbinding book. Everyone should experience this. Ok, enough of the superlatives. As you will probably have gleaned from other reviews, this is the story of one boy growing up in New York who experiences a life changing event (I'll say no more). His life is then tracked forward until the whole tale is exposed. And what a tale it is! The characters in this novel are expertly described and brilliantly brought to life. Best of all is Boris... just superb. I'm missing him badly. If you've never tried audio books I'd recommend you start here, with this book. The reader, David Pittu, was reportedly hand picked by the author and if true she made the perfect choice. He achieves a range of accents and tones to bring each participant alive and expertly evokes every emotion required. I've subsequently embarked on a desperate mission to find something of a similar quality - sadly, with no success to date!"

The book looked the part. The story appeared to be very interesting about Theo Decker, who has loved and lost, who enters the criminal underworld, an individual who finally makes a marvellous discovery in life and then, of course, there is his talisman, the painting of “The Goldfinch"". I also love Goldfinches and often photograph them in the garden if I can be in the right place with the camera at the right time. It’s a beautifully published book and I also was taken with the additional touch of the photo of “The Goldfinch” which is loosely tacked onto the frontispiece. The glowing reviews assured me that it was a 2013 literary masterpiece. It’s very well written too. So where did it all go wrong, well for me anyway? Perhaps the contradictory comment by Albert Camus before Chapter one says it all? I felt oddly cynical about the first sentence of the book as similar words are so often used at the beginning in novels: I automatically thought about “Rebecca” for some obscure reason. It’s sad hearing about Theo losing his mother in tragic circumstances and to think that he admits after so many years he’s never met anyone who made him feel loved in the way she did. I always like reading about New York but still I couldn’t get into the story. I don’t know why and then I started to skim read looking for that magical literary work I was sure was there. But it wasn’t there. Individuals such as Goldie, Boris and Xandra floated by…as if in a dream. There were some magical sections such as the following, and the referrals to love, but still not enough to entice me: I have such a sense of regret here. Perhaps this book is not right for me at this period in time. Perhaps personal reasons have subconsciously entered into the equation. I will place it next to my beloved “The Alexandria Quartet” on the bookshelf to remind me of it and I may read it in the future."

Like calling that baton you buy in the grocery store a baguette. While it has certainly been a page turner there are still so many things that are irksome. 1. The 13 year-old Theo Decker has the emotional maturity of an 8 or 9 year old. Same goes for his friend Andy van der Woodsen, I mean Barbour. For two upper East Side private school boys they seem shockingly stunted. And, my god, don't they have internet up there? Who uses the phone book? How did that child ever get into MIT? 2. Both Pippa (Pip, Middleton, what have you)and Kitsey Barbour are the bifurcated versions of Camilla Macauley (see Tartt, ): same trailer, different park. 3. The grown-up version of Theo is too much like the first-season Dan Humphrey. Part Greenwich Village Idiot, part inside-outsider with his nose pressed up against the glass. 4. What's with all of the 6'5"" literary guardian angels whose names start with H: Hagrid, Hodor, and now Hobie. 5. By the end of the novel, it becomes a nightmarish mash-up of (more) meets Quentin Tarrantino. Except that there are no black people. 6. Is it still possible to get high from sniffing glue? I thought that ended in 1972. Evidently not. 7. The word ""fractal"" should not be used in a novel twice. Even if the novel runs 770 pages. 8. And the most annoying one of all? The poorly paraphrased Gloucestercian line, ""As flies to wanton boys..."" spoken by a barely glimpsed walk-on character. Nonetheless, I read it."

There were slow parts that I think would have been boring if I wouldn't have been able to let them fly by on my commute. That being said, this story probably could have been told in 400 pages, but the author really fleshed it out, told extra anecdotes, focused on detail, stressed existential introspection of the main character. In the end, all these things came together for a pretty amazing experience. I give this 4 stars simply because I am amazed of the detail the author put into it - it is a work of art.

Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate. : The Doubleday UK meme, , is the goad I'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. Today's prompt is to identify the book one would take to a desert island. It was between this book and , a more artistically successful and more culturally enriching book; a book with grace and beauty and charm; a rich feast that says things to me even yet, months after reading it. I chose this book. It's not Art, but it's a good, solid, real moment. I bought into Theo, I cared about the dumbass, I found him the kind of kid I'd try to fix and straighten out so he wouldn't flounder so messily as he looked for the path through the thicket. Then there's traife like this: ""'When you feel homesick,' he said, ‘just look up. Because the moon is the same wherever you go.'” Gag me. That's so Disney-movie pseudoprofound I could unswallow all over the book. But then... Sadly, it goes on after that to bury the well-made point and the well-turned phrase in verbiage. Donna Tartt won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in recognition of this novel. I am not equipped with the information the judges of that prize use to make their decision. I can only say that, from my perspective as a reader, this is a good, solid read that should've been 600pp not 771pp, with many lovely phrases and a lot of good, well-incorporated action, but not especially prize-worthy. It's a thumping good read, as my friend Suz says. And for that reason, I'd take it to a desert island, and I'd cuss and fume and fret about its shortcomings after I finished each read wet-eyed about Theo and his travails. Sometimes Theo acts so damned clueless I wanted to give him a bloody box of chocolates and a bench and plant a ly raven called Grip on his damn shoulder. And then: So, yeah, this is the one that makes the desert island trip. Sorry, Eleanor Catton, your gorgeous and so very deserving tome will wait for me safe on my shelf."

Only - if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things - beautiful things - that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another? ...You see one painting, I see another, the art book puts it at another remove still, the lady buying the greeting card at the museum gift shop sees something else entire, and that's not even to mention the people separated from us by time - four hundred years before us, four hundred years after we're gone - it'll never strike anybody in the same way and the great majority of people it'll never strike in any deep way at all but - a really great painting is fluid enough to work its way into the mind and heart through all kinds of different angles, in ways that are unique and very particular. "" While reading , I kept thinking about that old Psych 101 question: You're in an art museum when a fire breaks out. In the room with you is an old woman, and a priceless Rembrandt. You can only save one. Which do you choose? This is the best way I can think of to describe the characters in Donna Tartt's books: they would all, without hesitation, choose to save the painting. This doesn't mean that they're evil, or even particularly bad. They just have different priorities, and a love of beautiful things that often blinds them and causes havoc in their lives. (I'm including the characters of in that description, because the themes and characters in this book are so similar that it functions almost as an unofficial sequel - Tartt's middle book, , is the strange, possibly-illegitimate cousin who no one really likes and will therefore not be invited to this party) This book begins with what is essentially a real-life scenario of the question I posed above. One afternoon, thirteen-year-old Theo Decker is with his mother in an art museum, at a Dutch Masters exhibit. There is a bombing, which Theo barely survives, and when he is trying to get out of the ruined gallery he comes across an old man. The man, dying and disoriented, thinks that Theo is someone else and gives him his ring and says, ""Hobart and Blackwell. Ring the green bell."" Theo leaves the museum with two new possessions: the ring, and a small painting by Carel Fabritius called . Theo eventually tracks down the antique shop and becomes friends with Hobart (Hobie) a furniture restorer. But before we can get too invested in this, real life intrudes: Theo's mother died in the bombing, and Theo's only living relative is his deadbeat, gambling-addicted father, who shows up out of nowhere and brings Theo to live with him in Las Vegas. Theo spends several years living in a situation that is, frankly, Dickensian as fuck. It also drags on a lot longer than I thought it needed to, but the section establishes two important things: first, Theo is a lot more like his father than he likes to admit; and two, he makes a friend named Boris, a petty criminal who will become very important later. Eventually Theo makes it back to New York, and throughout all of this, the painting goes with him. It becomes more than a painting: it becomes an object of comfort, a memory of his mother, and a vital part of his life. ""The painting had made me feel less moral, less ordinary. It was support and vindication; it was sustenance and sum. It was the keystone that had held the whole cathedral up...all my adult life, I'd been privately sustained by that great, hidden, savage joy: the conviction that my whole life was balanced atop a secret that might at any moment blow apart."" (I wasn't joking about this being an almost-sequel to - that last sentence could have easily been spoken by Richard Papen) I'll be honest: the best part of the plot (when someone begins to suspect that Theo was the person who stole the painting) takes way, way too long to get started, and the whole thing blows up so quickly that we almost don't have time to catch our breath. But I didn't mind, because lest we forget, this is Donna Tartt's first book in , so even when the plot dragged, I was still enjoying the feeling of being immersed in her world of corrupt heroes and savage beauty. Those who haven't read may find themselves a little adrift in this world where all the characters would choose to save a painting and let a person die instead. Those who found melodramatic or contrived or ridiculous will find nothing here that interests them. They can go sit somewhere else; I'll be over here at Tartt's table with the damaged, emotionally-unavailable borderline-sociopaths, talking about art. Over here, everything is beautiful and everything hurts, and that's the way we like it. ""Whenever you see flies or insects in a still life - a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple - the painter is giving you a secret message. He's telling you that living things don't last - it's all temporary. Death in life. That's why they're called natures mortes. Maybe you don't see it at first with all the beauty and bloom, the little speck of rot. But if you look closer - there it is."""

I sorta feel obligated to compliment the writing. I mean the writing itself was by any definition phenomenal. I just couldn't get into the story, and I have no idea why. I have no clue why so much was happening (I mean there was a fricking terrorist attack) and I was still so bored. It was just Holden Caufield^n if n=infinity. Like Theo just didn't change. Well--spoilers below . . . . He changed after his mom died obviously but that was early in the book. From there the rest of the book was just angst. So much angst. So much pining, so much self-loathing and so much angst. Again, it's not like this wasn't unjustified, but it was a long book, and a lot of angst. It didn't make the stakes feel any higher, it just made me dislike Theo. I don't mind disliking the protagonist, but there was just nothing to latch on to. I mean he was a pretty reactive protagonist in the end (especially during the climax). Like he killed Martin, sure, but he didn't steal the painting back, or set up the job. He just got carried around by Boris, shoved in the right place at the right time, then yeah he shot a guy at the end to give him some action but after that it was back to the angst. I was disappointed by how unimportant Las Vegas turned out to be. I mean all it did was send Theo on a life of drugs and all the important things to happen in Vegas happened to Boris after Theo left so we didn't even see it. All we saw was drug use, angst, and how pathetic his father was. I don't know. I'm talking in circles now.

This book was on my watch list for a long time. I planned on reading it after but didn't pull the trigger until it went on sale for $1.99. This is one of those books I have conflicting feelings over. It's a literary novel and is a fine example of everything that entails, both the things I like and the things I don't. Donna Tartt's writing is as wonderful as ever. She's got a knack for stringing words together, painting vivid images. The various locals all seemed very real: New York, Las Vegas, Amsterdam. Little bits of philosophy were scattered throughout the text, musings on life, the universe, and everything. Theo goes from one fuck-up to the next, not really imagining any consequences down the line, and things go pretty well for him. Until they don't. While I think The Goldfinch was beautifully written and very readable, I didn't give a rat's ass about any of the characters other than Boris. Boris was the only one I felt had any real substance. The rest were caricatures, for the most part. Theo didn't show a lot in the way of personality and seemed like a collection of traits more than a character. Like a lot of modern lit, the book felt like it was trying too hard to be profound at times and wasn't terribly concerned with telling a story. This thing is a whopper at 771 pages and the story could have easily been told, flourishes and all, in half of that. I did like the twists when they happened but it was kind of like seeing a billboard along a stretch of I-70 in the middle of Kansas, something to break up the endless journey. Near the end, asked me if I was enjoying it. Enjoy wasn't the word I would use. I'm glad I experienced the book and there were parts I liked quite a bit, most featuring Boris, but there was never a time I wished the book would never end. In conclusion, I will probably never be on the board that awards the Pulitzer Prize. The Goldfinch is some fantastic writing but not a hell of a lot in the way of a story. Glad I read it, gladder still that it's over. Three out of five stars."

You’ll need lots of space for “The Goldfinch,” Donna Tartt’s giant new masterpiece about a small masterpiece by Carel Fabritius. Don’t worry if you can’t recall that name from a dark and somnolent art-history classroom. Though he was a celebrated student of Rembrandt, the Dutch painter was almost blasted into obscurity by a gunpowder explosion in 1654, a fatal accident that made his few extant paintings even rarer than ’s. But Tartt’s novel is no delicate study of a girl with a pearl earring. She places Fabritius’s tiny bird at the center of a capacious story that soars across the United States and around the planet, lighting on themes of beauty, family and destiny. Tartt’s many fans have waited with great expectations since her previous book, “The Little Friend,” was published in 2002. While the world has been transformed over the past decade, one of the most remarkable qualities of “The Goldfinch” is that it arrives singed with 9/11 terror but redolent of a 19th-century novel. Indeed, floats through these pages like Marley’s ghost. You can hear the great master in everything from the endlessly propulsive plot to the description of a minor character with a “cleft chin, doughball nose, tense slit of a mouth, all bunched tight in the center of a face which glowed a plump, inflamed, blood-pressure pink.” There’s nothing slavish, though, about Tartt’s allusions to Dickens. She’s not writing an extension of “Great Expectations” such as Peter Carey’s marvelous “.” Still, anyone who’s run through the streets of London with Pip and Estella will catch glimpses of those characters and others in “The Goldfinch.” And even if Tartt can’t write with Dickens’s speed, she knows how to create the same kind of intimate voice, laced with her own brand of mordant comedy and sorrow that makes us willing captives. Although it opens on a Christmas Day, amid the festivities of the season, the story is framed by grief. Theo Decker is rotting in a hotel room in Amsterdam, sweaty with fever and narcotics, afraid to leave or even call for help. His only solace is a brief dream visit from his beloved mother, who died 14 years ago, when he was a mischievous eighth-grader. “Things would have turned out better if she had lived,” Theo begins, and immediately we’re swept back to that calamitous spring day in New York when he and his mom darted into the Metropolitan Museum. Just moments after she explains the composition of Rembrandt’s unnerving “Anatomy Lesson,” Theo finds himself lying amid dozens of bodies flayed by a terrorist’s bomb. In the chaos of flesh and rubble, Theo comforts a dying old man and then stumbles out of the smoldering museum clutching Fabritius’s “The Goldfinch,” his mother’s favorite painting —saved from the flames of fate once again. With its bloody ironies and nested coincidences, this explosive opening scene is awash with the concussive disorientation of the moment but also polished by years of regret. Amid the smoke and sirens, Theo is “gasping, half-choked with plaster dust,” already tormented by the illusion of culpability, by the endlessly rehearsed accusation that he could have placed his mother and himself somewhere else — anywhere else — that day. This is, among many other things, a novel of survivor’s guilt, of living in “the generalized miasma of shame and unworthiness and being-a-burden.” With a Dutch master’s attention to detail, Tartt has created a narrative voice that is simultaneously immediate and retrospective, filled with the boy’s adolescent anxieties and the man’s fermented despair. “How was it possible to miss someone as much as I missed my mother?” Theo says. “Sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking out over a brackish wreck which was illuminated in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.” While grief may be the novel’s bassline, Theo’s wit and intelligence provide the book’s endearing melody. Orphaned by the Met bombing, he and that stolen painting drift from one temporary family to another, all of them composed of vibrant characters that he turns over in his mind like a connoisseur of human personality. “How had I fetched up into this strange new life?” Theo wonders, as a series of elaborately developed episodes shows off the range of Tartt’s skill. In Manhattan, she conjures up a brittle Park Avenue clan with all its unconscious privilege and gold-plated dysfunction. In Las Vegas, she’s just as attentive to the tragicomedy of a gambler and his floozy girlfriend riding to ruin on inebriated fantasies of easy money. The novel reaches its greatest luster in an antique store that Theo finds by following the mysterious instructions of that dying old man in the Met. It’s a magical place “where every clock in the house said something different and time didn’t actually correspond to the standard measure but instead meandered along at its own sedate tick-tock, obeying the pace of his antique-crowded backwater, far from the factory-built, epoxy-glued version of the world.” There, under the tutelage of an absent-minded restorer, Theo enjoys a bit of restoration himself. His appreciation for beautiful old things is refined and nurtured — along with his indelible love for a wounded young woman who lives among the antiques. Tartt has created a rare treasure: a long novel that never feels long, a book worthy of our winter hibernation by the fire. In fact, toward page 500, a couple of hundred pages after most novelists would have packed up their sentences and closed the covers, she recharges the plot by introducing another complex strain of intrigue involving international gangsters. And so, at the very moment when you fear it might stall, “The Goldfinch” takes flight again. But the Victorian tenor of this thoroughly modern novel isn’t reflected only in its extended plot and vast collection of memorable characters. You can also feel that 19th-century spirit in the author’s willingness to take advantage of her enormous canvas to reflect self-consciously on moral and aesthetic concerns that so many contemporary fiction writers are too timid or too sophisticated to address directly. Free will and fate, pragmatic morality and absolute values, an authentic life and a dutiful one — those fusty old terms spring to life in an extended passage of philosophical trompe l’oeil as Theo expounds with the authority of a man who has suffered, who knows why the chained bird sings. Through years of guilt and drug-dulled pain, experience has taught him that loving something sublime can soothe “the writhing loneliness of life.” The novel ends in full-throated praise for the power of a great painting to sink into your soul, to act as a bulwark against the inevitable victory of death. Look here: A great novel can do that, too."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Epic, beautiful, heartbreaking, gripping, mesmerizing - I'll use all these words to describe this book, but still won't do it justice. So many things I loved about this book - the artsy aspect to it, the mystery, the truly flawed characters that I cared so much about, the big life questions that we all ponder... I finished this book months ago and still think about it. I've heard this described as a YA novel but don't understand that, other than I suppose it could be considered a coming of age novel - but so many regular adult fiction books could be classified that way too. I found it complex, rich, yet very accessible. Beautifully written, in such a simple and nonjudgmental voice. It's super long, but that just provides more time to enjoy the story. Best read of 2014 for me!"

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book does the painting justice. It was lovingly crafted over the span of 10 years and it shows. The book is sooooo long, but in order to tell the story properly and have the reader fully appreciate it it needs to be. That's why the film version flopped so bad. I can see this being a series because only that medium would allow you to fall in love with the story in the same manner. This is definitely one of those ""it's the journey not the destination"" type books. If you focus on just the painting you may feel like it drones on and on. It's not about the painting. The painting is a key part of it, but this is a coming of age story about a boy who experiences great levels of loss at an unbelievably early age. Theo is always struggling for a stable home and life, but nothing is coming to him easily. When you factor in his never-wavering sense of right and wrong, he is always battling his inner demons just to survive another day. What an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Even the ending leaves the reader with a lot to think about. Just like real life, it's complicated and is open to interpretation."

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""There's no 'rational grounds' for anything I care about."" This is turning into the summer where I read much anticipated forthcoming novels, but which I'm slightly undeserving to read since I haven't read the author's previous novel. There are probably a lot more deserving people out there for these books. But that's the benefit of being Karen's best friend, and she does get it right most of the time This is not an easy book to review. If you haven't read this book yet and you look forward to reading it I would recommend treading lightly while reading other reviews. I haven't seen too many yet, and the ones I have seen are just fine, but I do imagine once this book is released there will be more than a few 'book reports' of the novel given. And seriously any book report of this is a major spoiler. Any. Unless you like reading almost eight hundred page books and not letting the author craft the story in her own wonderous way and would like some internets book reviewer to usurp the meticulous way she discloses just about every detail of the story. Besides the masterful manner she tells the story, what impressed me most about the book was how deftly Donna Tartt wrote from the male perspective. I'm sure that there are more than a few parts of this book where Tartt's voice comes through in place of the main character's, but even when (if?) it does, this is a long novel written in a quite authentic sounding male perspective (ok, a very particular type of male, and maybe one that I can relate to on a bunch of levels so it feels sort of like, hey she's getting it right....), which maybe isn't all that impressive, since it's a skill novelists have had in their toolboxes for quite some time now. Maybe it's just reading another book recently that was so obviously just the author rambling on about things he didn't like and then calling it a novel, and a technical one at that because he had the gumption to only hit enter and tab once to start only a second paragraph in all over a hundred and something pages that I'm feeling more in awe of the finely constructed workmanship on display in this novel. Her nailing the male voice was reminiscent to me of the way A.M. Homes got it right also in her latest novel, . I thought about not giving this book five stars though. There were a few parts of the book that I wasn't completely fond of, and while I think that the main character was wonderfully done, I also thought that he was a bit tiresome at times, but I also think that I'm quite tiresome at times and the sort of person he is, well he should be a bit tiresome and much at times. Not that there was anything wrong with him as a character, he just didn't shine sometimes like the supporting cast of characters did. If I'd read more than one Charles Dickens novel I'd say that this is sort of like what he does, with such great secondary characters that really bring to life the story. But I might just be talking out of my ass here. It wouldn't be the first time for that. There are also certain things in the book I would have liked to have seen resolved in different ways, and I will admit to feeling frustrated that what I wanted wasn't happening, but just because a book didn't meet my exact expectations, great as they may be, doesn't mean that the book is worse for that. It's probably actually better for not doing what I wanted it to do. If I'd been steering this plot there probably would have been some serious bullshit resolutions going on. So I'll admit I was toying with giving his four stars because it didn't quite go the way I wanted, but I'm also not sure exactly what I wanted, or how everything could have been resolved in a satisfying manner if the couple of things I wanted to happen had happened. What else. There are some interesting mentions of music in the book. I think you could find worse things to do on a summer evening than look on Spotify some of the classical composers mentioned as being on Theo's and Pippa's iPods and giving them a listen. She also mentions Belle and Sebastian and Arvo Pärt, two favorites of mine for different listening moods. I thought of making a playlist of things she mentioned in the book, but I sort of forgot and I have to be passing on this ARC soon, but maybe if I get a regular trade edition I'll embark on this quest. There are actual things about the book I'd kind of like to write about, but I'll leave them be, I'm really paranoid about the whole spoiler thing, not that they are major spoilers, but just wonderful ways she handles the story that if I say much more I'll just ruin, and I have no interest in ruining this for anyone."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have not read Donna Tartt's other books. Even though, she has gotten much critical acclaim, the stories just didn't seem to interest me, but for some reason I was attracted to The Goldfinch. I was at first put off by the length - 775 pages in the kindle version. I will admit that there may have been a few times when I felt that it dragged on a bit, but there was never a moment that I thought that I would put it down. This is the best book I have read this year and may very well be one of my favorites ever. From the beginning I was so taken by the story of Theo Decker and I cared about what happened to him from the first page to the last. The cast of incredible characters in Theo's life, Tartt's absolutely beautiful descriptive, detailed writing were for me spell binding. It's a story of insurmountable loss, friendship, love, art, and some deeply philosophical themes that I would not presume to write about. Starting with the bombing at the Museum of Art and the death of his mother , Theo’s life if filled with sadness . The losses just continue until Theo finally loses himself to drugs, finds himself involved in the underworld of stolen art , as the result of his taking the painting of the goldfinch on that fateful day. But no matter what he does, even towards the end with the incredible and complicated series of events that lead him to the depths of despair, my heart was broken for him as he says “Because , here’s the truth: life is catastrophe. …..better never born than born into this cesspool. “ Then somehow on the last pages, Theo finds some good, some hope – “That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open….For if disaster and oblivion have followed this painting down through time - so too has love.” It’s too long of a book to think about reading again now , but I might have to someday."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"How do you describe a book like this? Deep, disturbing, thrilling, one of the best. I will never forget this book."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"My experience reading The Goldfinch was a rocky one. It started off strong with a terrorist attack on a museum, the loss of a mother, a mysterious young girl, and a stolen painting of a, you guessed it, goldfinch. The first few chapters set the stage for what I anticipated would be a long journey unfolding how Theo comes with the death of his mom, who the girl is, and how he got the painting back to the museum, if he actually did. But what ultimately happens as the book meanders on is... a lot of filler, a lot of nothing. Many of the characters felt cartoonish and unrealistic. There’s a lot of drugs and a lot of crime. Every two chapters jumps the story forward a few years, and even though the time advanced, the story never felt like it did. Theo just spends a lot of time doing drugs and talking about art or furniture. He bounces around to different locations, commits more crimes, and spends page after page thinking too much. I’ve read plenty of reviews that praise Tartt’s writing, but I just wasn’t feeling it. From the beginning I was annoyed by how lazily she described things. Rather than use adjectives or descriptive language, she just used nouns and commas. For example, and this is not an exaggeration, I will describe my morning to you in the style of Donna Tartt.... “I woke up and got dressed. Shirt, pants, shoes. I made myself a cup of coffee, adding other stuff to it. Cream, sugar, cinnamon. I looked at the books on my shelf to decide what to read. The Goldfinch, Dickens, poetry. I decided to plow through The Goldfinch so I could finish it today. I had other books waiting to be read. Gilead, Blood Meridian, others. I read several chapters before making breakfast. Eggs, sausage, toast. I ate breakfast and grabbed the other stuff I needed. Keys, wallet, phone....” You get the point. Speaking of Dickens, after just finishing Great Expectations, I noticed so many similarities in this book. She was definitely inspired by him in writing The Goldfinch, and she even references him at least once, maybe twice. Three, four, five. Anyway, the story, when it was on, when things moved, it was good. It started and ended pretty well, but the book could have easily been half the size without all the bloat and it would have delivered a better result. Shorter, more concise, more enjoyable. There’s a movie coming out later this year based on the book, and maybe a movie will enhance the story more since it has less time to tell it. We’ll see. I’m not sure I understand the Pulitzer Prize anymore. I finished the book, it was engaging at times, the story was interesting, but it was very lopsided for me. The middle was a bit tedious to wade through, but there’s enough there for me to push it to three stars. Now it’s time to read some shorter books."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This started off reasonably well but very soon I hit a bad patch, too many words doing too little, and much too great a scatter of blood soaked clues so I began to skim read but then it became interesting again, the words better chosen, so I slowed down but soon got bored and speeded up again, avoiding especially any dialogue containing statements with question marks on the end? There have been some skilled digressers in the history of literature, Laurence Sterne for one, Raymond Federman for two, but Donna Tartt gives a hole new meaning to the word 'digression': Lost Wages, Nevada (and how deep a hole that is) may replace what I formerly thought of, with the respectest respect, as, and only now do I realise how clever was the original concept, how funny and allround neat, a digression My book group met last night. We are rarely unanimous about the books we read but this time was an exception. We wondered how our collective opinion could differ so radically from that of the jury for the Pulitzer Prize. We wondered how a book about a small and perfect painting could be so radically different from its subject. We wondered about publishing today. We wondered about editing. We wondered.."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This story is about a boy who loses a mother and gains a painting, which sets him on a path of loss and gain, like nothing I've experienced before. The author Donna Tartt is a literary master. The book is long, more than 700 pages, but don't let that put you off. It doesn't feel like work, in fact, I couldn't put it down it drags you into the story of a boy who loses his mother and is burdened with a priceless painting. The description of how he loses his mother had my heart racing -- literally -- pounding in my chest. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, and by now you probably know as a consequence of a terrorist bomb. The scenes that follow are so real I felt like I was Theo like I was home waiting for my mother, my only care-giver. It was too real. Impossible to read. Impossible not to. The story changes gear several times and every time it kept me hanging on, gripping onto the edge of my proverbial reading chair. Theo, the narrator has no roots, is bounced around from home to home, living with a series of people -- a friend from school, his absent father, and the gay partner of the man he watched die in the bomb blast. He plunges into depression, drugs, crime, an evoking boyhood friendship, and even, for a short while, homelessness. His only stability, his secret (priceless painting, The Goldfinch) which he keeps nearby and hidden. We experience his wounds and the consequences of them and the dislocation of his life - emotional, physical, and spiritual. There are so many twists and turns in this tale of a motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions remain unclear, they all have their own stuff to deal with. The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, a student of Rembrandt's, who died at the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed. The Goldfinch is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. At the beginning of the book, Theo's mother, moments before she dies says, ""anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,"" and this theme runs deep through the veins of the novel. It should come as no surprise, that Theo's only treasure becomes an opportunity for betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing, and crime. Not all action and suspense, some of the book's most memorable moments happen in stillness. The prose is glorious. I highlighted over a hundred passages to revisit for their beautiful craft. This novel is much more than plot and characters it takes you much further. The last few pages integrate all the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and holds them up to the light. Not with clever riffs, humor or op-ed themes but to a place beyond that – to a place of meaning, or, as the author refers to it, ""a rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love."""
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Solid story. Gifted writer. I met the author at a party. She's very tiny-maybe five feet tall. If Magic Johnson put her in his pocket, you would NEVER KNOW."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Low buzzing noise, inside the room. Guiltily I turned - someone coming? No: only Popchik, cotton white after his bath, nestled among the pillows of her unmade bed and snoring with a drooling, blissful, half-purring sound. And though there was something pathetic about it - taking comfort in her left-behind things like a puppy snuggled in an old coat - I crawled in under the sheets and nestled down beside him, smiling foolishly at the smell of her comforter and the silky feel of it on my cheek. This is really hard for me to rate. WHAT WAS GOOD: 1.) The writing. The writing isn't just good - it's excellent. The book is a beautiful work of art. I mean, as a piece of writing, not the physical book although that's nice, too. Tartt writes wonderful, exquisite, touching, truthful passages. She also has a stunning vocabulary that had me scrambling for a dictionary more than once. Actually, probably about 100 times. 2.) The physical book. It is printed (at least the hardback first edition) on some kind of silky, high-quality paper that you will find yourself absentmindedly stroking at odd times while reading. o.O 3.) The book is a bit funny! This was the loveliest surprise to me. I would have been 10x more likely to pick this up if I had known it was going to make me laugh. I mean, it's not a laughfest! But at least one good laugh every fifty pages. I was chuckling out loud, even in public. Such a plus! Who wants to read something boring or sad? Or even worse, boring AND sad? 4.) Excellent, fleshed-out characters that you can easily visualize. For the most part. 5.) The amazing, wonderful and strange friendship between Borys and Theo that I adored. It was very intense and very..., I don't know. I just really, really liked it. I think this aspect of the book is where Tartt's being a female shows through. Okay. Do you know how we always ask and analyze if male authors have written ""good"" (meaning accurate, I guess) female characters? But this question is rarely turned around. Does this female author write ""good"" (meaning accurate) male characters? Tartt chooses to make her main character a boy. (I say 'boy' because he is 13-15 for 60% or so of the book). The friendship between Borys and Theo really threw me for a loop. I had no idea boys had friendships like this. You'd know what I mean if you read the book. The only people I've known with friendships like this one are a.) girls/women and b.) men who have been through some shit together (war, prison, concentration camps of any sort, grown up in the orphanage together... stuff like that). So it was strange to me to see the boys in this kind of friendship together. Had they been through some shit? Yes, I suppose you could argue that this is the reason they had such an intense and strong and close and telepathic friendship, but to me that argument doesn't really hold water. But I'll accept it as a theory. The shit these boys went through was separate shit, not shared shit. Which is why it was harder for me to think this was a super-realistic friendship. But okay. I adored the friendship, whether it was realistic or not. 6.) Great portrayal of mourning and PTSD. ... WHAT WAS BAD: Sigh. 1.) The first 428 pages of the book (out of 771), when Theo is aged 13-16ish were amazing and I really loved them. However, after that, when Theo is an adult (starting on page 429 when it's '8 years later' and Theo is 23ish) I hated him. I despised him. I couldn't stand him. Because Adult Theo is a dirtbag. Now, granted, as a kid Theo was a dirtbag, too. However, I am forgiving of kids. I can forgive and understand 13-15-year-old Theo for doing all kinds of shit. He's a child/teen, his mom died in a horrific way, his choice of friends is... less than savory, ... all that and it's resulting events I can understand and forgive. Fine. But when it turns out he's grown and he's pulling the same shit at age 25 that he did when he was 14, well, that's where I have some problems. Sure. Sure I'm compassionate. But we're talking about someone who 12 years (TWELVE YEARS) after the 'accident' still cannot do basic, human things like be honest, have a healthy romantic relationship, or live a single day without and I'm like -_- Come on. PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, MAN. Stop being such a weak-ass, pathetic-ass, dumbass, sorry excuse for a human being. I can't STAND the way he just goes through life, doing whatever comes into his head: The only thing I could understand and have sympathy for was the I have sympathy for that, even though I really didn't like it - especially since he is completely unconcerned with it and has been doing it for over a decade. He has NO thought of his future, NO love for anyone but himself, never fucking thinks about anyone but himself, he's a selfish being who just wallows in self-pity 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. He's pathetic. Weak. Completely despicable. Are you flippin' kidding me? No he doesn't. She's not even a real person to him, more like a teddy bear he's reaching out for or some kind of substitute for his mother. She, at least, tries to work on her shit and become a better person. She makes effort (I know it's hard!) to get back her life and she also tries hard to live in the world and be her own agent, whereas Theo just kind of sits there. And I didn't like Borys either - he's a dirtbag in his own right, striking his girlfriend and giving her a fat lip, also a druggie and an alcoholic, not to mention a thief who steals anything and everything that isn't nailed down - but at least he has a spine and some zest for life. Theo is just a sadsack who seems to think life isn't worth living. IT'S SO AGGRAVATING. I was seriously frustrated and angry to no end with Adult Theo. And he's DUMB. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. I'm talking about when And then there was no end to his philosophical bullshit whining about how life has no meaning and life is shit and all this stuff. *$#$ ^%#$*. Spare me! Stand up and start acting like a man! PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. Can't you see you're hurting the people around you, not to mention putting them in danger!?!?!?! Selfish. Okay. I'm calm. Breathe, Carmen. Breathe. ... The book isn't really about the Goldfinch (the painting). Instead, the painting acts as a sort of touchstone, bringing all the pieces and parts of the novel together. Which was a relief. I like art but I can't understand the way people go on about it. And there was a bit of that in this novel, but not so much ""Art is God! Worship art! Art is the meaning of life!"" stuff that I was upset. Just the right balance, in my opinion. ... The thing that made me most sad in this book was... Um, no. No. I mean, they do, but that's not what really got me. That's heartbreaking , but no. No. Actually I was angry with him for mooning after Pippa for a billion years when she was clearly ""We're just friends."" Can't take a hint. No, what REALLY got to me and made me sad was the stark reality that children have no agency and are kind of foisted off on whoever is willing to care for them. It's sad and terrifying to end up with relatives who don't want you, family friends who don't love you, people who abuse you, some random foster home where no one cares if you disappear for days or not... etc. etc. etc. Stuff like this is so real and so accurate and it makes me very sad. ... This book strongly reminded me of . It has the same kind of tone to it. Take that as you will. I was also struck with similarities to , most especially in the last 50 pages or so. ... Tl;dr - This book is a beautifully written work of art. But do you know what is just (if not more) important than the writing? The story. And I adored the first 60% of the book when Theo is young. However, once Theo hit adulthood I found myself increasingly angry, frustrated, and infuriated with him and his complete disregard for his own life and the lives of others. The ending didn't mollify me, either. Would I recommend reading this? I would say yes. It's gorgeous. But not perfect and certainly not a book that made me happy. More like a book that made me growl. At least it had a sense of humor occasionally. Without the laughs, I would have rated this much lower. Read at your own risk."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Update: Rereading this was a joy. I do not read a lot of very long books from writers I enjoy this much, and just letting myself read it in long stretches and short sips for a couple of weeks was bliss. The second time around felt very different. It turned out I only remembered the first half and had completely blanked out the second. Las Vegas didn't seem nearly so long the second time and not nearly so frustrating. Whereas the end felt both rushed and too long, the place where I did actually see places where some trimming would have been nice. I know people think it is too long, but there is so much that Tartt does when she lets us stretch out with the characters. Theo is so adept at withholding information from us and then casually dropping it so it is easily to miss how truly damaged and broken he is as he gives you the most important information in little bits here and there, never all at once. I still love the way this book is a modern version of the 19th century classics, a big fat story with themes of guilt and love and betrayal and crime and art and loyalty. I love the intricacy of its characters (I really did love Boris the second time around, I found him rather trying the first time. When you know he is not a distraction but part of the main event, an Artful Dodger type, it is much easier to relax and enjoy him. That is true for much of the book, honestly.) I still have no idea if this will actually work as a film, with it all condensed and shortened, but I'm glad I had a reread before the movie. ____________ Why did I decide to read ""David Copperfield"" when I was in college? Because Donna Tartt loved Dickens and was compared to Dickens and I figured I should read some Dickens. I suffered through that book. What I know now is that I should've read ""Great Expectations"" because that's where I see the similarities to Tartt. And now that I've read ""The Goldfinch"" I think the two go together beautifully. There are definitely shades and echoes of ""Great Expectations"" here. And lots of Dickensian flair... if Dickens had lived today and wrote about pill-popping and terrorist threats and such. (Which he would have, of course.) What has always impressed me about Tartt, and what she does here to an even greater extent than her previous novels, is how masterfully she pulls you through her story. I get hooked on her books as much as any suspense or mystery novel. I simply can't stop reading them. Her twists and turns are just plain brilliant and always unexpected. And that she can do all this with her prose is ridiculous. Her writing can go from sparse to lush on a dime and it never feels show-offy or indulgent. I rarely find first-person narratives wholly convincing, but she does it and I don't know how, but she does. If you're a Tartt fan, if--like me--The Secret History is basically your favorite book of all time, you won't be disappointed by The Goldfinch."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List I really hate that I didn't love this book to death like so many others :-( I would say I loved the first half or maybe a little more of the book, I felt like it was too long and some of the things I wasn't interested in toward the end. First off this painting by Carel Fabritius 1654 is so beautiful, so simple and so beautiful. It seemed like a normal day with Theo and his mom going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. but it wasn't anywhere near normal, this was the day (at thirteen-years-old) that Theo lost his mom when a bomb went off at the museum. Theo wakes up in the rubble and makes his way out. Theo meets a man that was trapped and gives him a ring for Theo to take it to his partner. And on the way out Theo takes the Goldfinch painting as well, that followed him throughout his childhood and adult life. When the social services find out that Theo is alone, that his mom died in the bombing, and his dad was who knows where as he left when Theo was a toddler and that his grandparents were too sick to take him... they set him up with a childhood friend and his family. It took a bit for Theo to try to fit in with this family... well I mean he's still in shock!.. but the family was rich and had their own little ways. Most of the kids were brats, but his friend Andy, I thought he was cool. It seems as soon as he starts to settle in, his no good father and girlfriend show up to take him from his home in New York to Las Vegas. We all know this is not a good idea, but he's Theo's father so that's what has to be done. I mean some people don't need to be parents! We all know his father just came back to try to get money etc. So, Theo's new life in Vegas isn't that great. He meets a friend named Boris that gets him into all kinds of drugs, which sucks. But I did like Theo and Boris as friends though. And I'm glad they found each other again in the end when they were adults. Anyway, a bunch of stuff goes down and Theo heads back to New York. Oh, I forgot to mention that Theo did get the ring back to Hobie and told him about his partner's (I forget his name) last moments. Hobie and he owned an antique store, where Hobie fixed up the old things etc. Theo started hanging around Hobie and they became good friends. So later on when he came back to town he lived with Hobie and learned the trade and became a partner with Hobie. I think this is where it took the turn for me. Theo is being harassed by someone that wants the painting and other things and so forth and so on. It's a big ole mess. I felt really bad at what Theo had to go through, it's like he didn't even have time to miss his mom at all. Everything pretty much worked out. There were some other people in the book that I liked and some that were real twats of course. What a beautiful little bird is the Goldfinch, and I hope more people get to read this book. :-)"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I am in the ""thank God this book is over"" camp. The premise of the story was pretty good, so I looked forward to reading it (my book group selected it based on the theme). Having often thought ""I can't go on,"" I did manage to plow through this, seemingly, never-ending quagmire of hopelessness and despair that offered me no meaningful resolution, even at the bitter end. I don't even have a good sense of how it ended, though I got to the end! In spite of his long soliloquy at the end of the book, I never got a good sense of how (or if) Theo evolved (in my mind he didn't). This might have made an interesting short-story or novella, but, instead, it was much too long, droning on and on about details and characters that had already been beaten to death. The writing style was stilted for me: too many sentences starting with ""I,""... and never finished; most of the dialogue was no more than one character monopolizing the conversation (monologues). Although I could feel some sympathy for the characters, the whole premise was so far-fetched (so many random orphans, such a total lack of happy people, such constant self-destructiveness, such boring people)that I lost interest in them and saw no redeeming qualities in any of them. If the point of this book is to feel what it's like to be in the heads of people suffering from PTSD, who are not recognized by anyone as having PTSD, who have no insight for seeking help or moving forward with their lives in constructive ways, who use it as a reason to self-destruct and destroy others with them - then maybe Ms. Tartt got the job done. It took the author 10 years to write this book; it will take me 10 minutes to forget it."

This book is dense, unique, and beautifully written. It takes time and care to read this slowly to appreciate every minute detail. It's so worth it."

I feel as though if I looked that word up (conflicted) in a dictionary it would say read for a better understanding of the term. Theo is a boy who lives alone with his mother. They visit a museum. There is a bombing and Theo’s mother is killed. It is there that Theo is influenced by a dying stranger, who gives him a ring and wants him to take “The Goldfinch”. “The Goldfinch” is a masterpiece! It is missed. Theo, whose father took off long ago, is left bereft and rudderless. He takes comfort from “The Goldfinch” and comes up with coping strategies to assuage his guilt. He too is conflicted. And I did wonder about Boris (I applaud Tartt on this character creation) And I was invested There is nothing wrong with this story. It is so beautifully written, it stimulates and delights all your many senses. It contains passages that are just so ravishingly well written That you are compelled to go back and read them again. Well now…………………………….. I got to say, it is also bloated, so much so that I am truly baffled by the editing process. Cut this beautiful baby bird down by two or three hundred pages and a Phoenix will surely emerge from the ashes of the discarded words. I was not enthralled. Reading this made me seriously anxious. The last one hundred or so pages were so tedious and exhausting that I wanted to scoop out my eyes with a spoon. Did I mention that I loved, loved, loved ?"

The more I think about it, the more I hate it! I was so desperate to love this book and at the beginning, I thought I would. The writing was beautiful, the plot intrigued me and I grew to care for the main character really quickly. But then it would take a plunge and I was bored out of my mind. And that's the main issue I had with it. It wasn't consistent and would constantly fluctuate. At times, I wanted to burst and declare my love for it and shout from the rooftops, to it leaving me feeling just completely empty! I was dreading to pick it back up and had to force myself to do so! And it's not that I have an issue with slow burning plots either - take Stoner, or A Little Life as an example. I just could not connect with this book. Too much unnecessary detail for me. Sorry book. It's not you, it's me. No, it is definitely you."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Goldfinch started out a five-star plus read, the first 500 pages or so were the most compulsively readable fiction I’ve read in quite some time. (Not necessarily “the best”, mind you, whatever that is, but that wonderful immersed feeling where you look forward to getting back to your book, where a whole commute goes by in a bated breath, and bedtimes go by the wayside). But then it fell off, sharply. The last 3rd dragged for me. Even beloved Boris started to grate. Tartt has always gotten a few more balls up in the air than she can gracefully land. Secret History worked, nonetheless, The Little Friend utterly failed. This book was somewhere in between. It ended, and not incompetently, but the last few hundred pages dragged, dabbled in cliché and deus ex machina resolutions, and somehow did not satisfy. But there was a lot to love here. Starting with the gut punch of the opening sections, an almost claustrophobically gripping nightmare of an opener, especially for all of us who were here during 9/11 and have turned, at some point, in the wee hours, to the black fantasy of what if it were me, how would I get out, how would I react. But Tartt adds a particularly traumatic twist – she takes the Met, a place that is a place of refuge, solace and enchantment for so many of us, especially those of us who grew up here – and makes it her Ground Zero. Intense. I had a panicky feeling reading those chapters. Tartt effectively brings us into the world of PTSD that is the novel’s landscape. And all of Theo’s childhood was wonderful. His Holly Golightly-esque mother, the amazing Barbours (stepped out of the pages of the Preppy Handbook), timeless unworldly Hobie, barren Las Vegas and brilliant picaresque Boris. I just kept turning pages – enthralled, saddened, yes, of course, but just enjoying reading and the ride. (Time is so interesting in this novel: Hobie is timeless, but so much of the novel is just as achronistic (more than anachronistic). The opening scene and fourteen years later are both incontrovertibly “now” – but so many of the characters seem sepia toned – is Hobie and Mrs. Barbour’s New York now? Or 50 years ago? Or never – except in the fantasy of the extraurban arrival from the heartland – Theo’s mother, Truman Capote, Tartt herself?) I especially enjoyed the way the book was a love poem to New York and to literature - particularly children’s literature and New York literature. (Yes, Dickens of course – Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, a great debt to the Old Curiosity Shop but also so very much Catcher in the Rye, and then so much else – from Breakfast at Tiffany’s to the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Certainly a little Wharton and James along the way. ) Tartt plays in a world that is both satisfyingly real and satisfyingly imaginary – especially to those of us whose imagination is irretrievably deformed by literature! But then – we bog down. A few too many drugs. A few too many nightmares. A few too many raveling and unraveling plot threads. At one point, there is the perfect ending – a lovely coming full circle, and, in a book soaked in Dickens, a perfect tribute to Scrooge’s redemption in A Christmas Carol. But then the book goes on, and on. Finally concluding with a 10 page exhortatory essay that I couldn’t make sense of as coming from Theo. After all that drama, we are left with a rather adolescent Romantic poetry-esque invocation to rage against the dying of the light, while remembering that Beauty is Truth … I know some people I respect have loved that ending, but it felt cheap to me, in light of all that had come before, a sort of ""Cliff Notes key to the novel"" postscript instead of coming to terms with a proper ending. Ah well, still undoubtedly worth the candle (or kilo of candles, as the case may be). And in 10 years, when both Ms. Tartt and I have slipped irrevocably into late middle age, I shall be sure to read her next investigation of childhood and adolescence (really – have you noticed? Tartt doesn’t do grownups? But we’ll save that for another day)."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"UPDATE I didn't review this after reading it because I was unsure how to think. I've since seen the movie and reflected on this book a lot. First, I didn't mind the movie! It wasn't as bad as people said Second, Overall I think I did *mostly* enjoy this book. My thoughts on it are mostly positive. I have thought about this book and story A LOT since I finished it. There are definitely some parts I hated, and some things that felt icky (the number of times white characters say the N word for literally, no fucking reason) BUT, the core story did impact me, and I loved the sections following Theo and Boris, as well as the parts following Theo as an adult. The art sections were intriguing to me and kickstarted me to look more into art. And I can't lie, I wanna go to this museum and see this paining! So would I reread it? Probably not - it's too long and badly need editing and I'm not sure I want to go through it all again. but will I continue to this about this book, it's characters and it's themes almost every day of my life for the forseeable future? yes OH MY GOD I FINISHED IT ... I AM PROUD OF READING THIS ENTIRE CHONKY BOI !!! I dont know what my review is gonna be because there is a lot to process in this book but heres some quotes I liked"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Update: September, 2019 Here's my review of the film, which premiered this week at the Toronto Film Festival. Ugh. https://nowtoronto.com/movies/tiff201... *** Donna Tartt's big, bold, boisterous doorstop of a novel uses a tragic accident and a priceless 17th century Dutch painting to reflect on fate, grief, beauty, friendship and mortality. At nearly 800 pages, it could use tightening, but there's such heart and wisdom packed in here that I wouldn't want to lose a word. Tartt has matured considerably since penning . The plot, complete with a few Dickensian coincidences, is beautifully paced; the settings (New York City, Las Vegas, Amsterdam) vivid; and the characters – from a wide variety of backgrounds – simply unforgettable. It's no surprise that she can write about privileged Upper East Side types. But she shows equal skill getting inside the heads of restless Vegas dreamers or low-life European gangsters; she can make us feel what it's like to be a junkie aching for a fix; in her hands, the world of antique furniture restoring becomes thrilling. And while there's an old-fashioned feel to the narrative, with obvious nods to Dickens, the book's tone is decidedly unsentimental and modern. Bursting with life, light and energy, is a modern masterpiece."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"While I enjoyed Tartt's first two novels, The Secret History and The Little Friend (see my review), there was something missing from each that held me back from thinking they were great. I have no reservations here. Though this is not a novel of 9/11, I can't help but wonder if it is (partly) Tartt's response to it. It certainly seems to be informed by the event, as it details and describes a character (actually two characters, though the other is in the 'middle-ground' of the story) who has survived a catastrophic event in NYC and suffers from PTSD, how his life is irrevocably altered by one event, spiraling out of control and into choices that are unconscious and perhaps fated. The prevalence of drugs in the world -- and the results of their easy access -- is also a relevant, contemporary topic. When the story would become almost unbearably bleak, the subtle allusions to Dickens' works was exciting (at least, to me, a Dickens fan), causing me to smile, especially the last one when Theo wakes up in his hotel room and realizes ... well, I won't give it anyway. While grasping these literary references isn't essential, they are more than just for fun: they fit an overarching theme about the relationship of art, any kind of art, to the individual, a theme beautifully described in the last few pages, pages that brought tears to my eyes, even more so when I reread them this morning. Theo has in the same way I believe Donna Tartt has Dickens."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"2.5 This is going to be a very unpopular review with some. So many fives and fours, just can't do it. I loved the first hundred pages, Hobe, Pippa even liked the last 80 pgs. It was the middle that did me in, it dragged, discussed every drug taken, teenage angst, so much could have been cut out of this and still kept the integrity of the story. Wished there had been more discussions of the art, at least I would have felt I learned something. Well written, yes. Entertaining form some, but was mostly a struggle for me. Maybe would have liked it more if 200 or more pages were cut from it. I think Pulitzer prize winners and I just do not relate. Did not like the Goon Squad or Tinkers either. Oh well, moving on."

Leaving this here to remind me that I should sit down and write a proper review for what still is one of my favorite books!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I read an article a few months ago on Hierocles' idea of human relationships - he suggests that they are patterned on a series of concentric circles, like a succession of Russian nesting dolls and we occupy the innermost circle. Our challenge is to draw these circles closer together and I saw this marvelously unfolding in The Goldfinch, although sometimes, the innermost circle that Theo occupied shrunk hopelessly until he was but a dot, mourning, grieving and lonely. But the link between him and reality - the painting, The Goldfinch always drew him out, expanding his own worldview and giving him a taste of an immortal life. While the book beautifully deals with several themes - love, loss, addiction, art, immortality, grief, depression and life itself, what will stay with me for years to come is what I love the most in Virginia Woolf's novels - the scope of history, the simultaneous grandeur and decay of time, the sense of it passing irretrievably, the odd, cold feeling that sometimes washes over us on lonely nights, that we try so hard to thwart - we are but helpless spectators in our own lives. When I was eighteen and dealing with a fresh bout of depression in my first year of college, the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats was necessary reading material for my English literature paper. ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."" These lines opened up new, shimmering vistas for my hazy, muddled mind. And yesterday, as I finished The Goldfinch, I returned to these same vistas, only to find them changed - they are now bigger and and more pellucid. Tartt's book is suffused with the idea that by participating in art, even if it is as a mere spectator, we become a part of its transcendental truth, beauty and immortality. And so we live on."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},Oh well - put me down as one of the people who missed the point with this novel. I found it overly long and full of tedious passages of prose which went no where. If I had known that so much of the story would be about two pathetic junkies and their sordid lives I would never have started it. And so many unpleasant or nonsensical characters. Enough. I have to go and find a really good book to make me feel better.

I think there's nothing worse than when a book doesn't let me forget myself. This is definitely a long book but I didn't find myself wondering when it would end, I lost track of time while reading. I like Donna Tartt's writing style and I loved the characters. Definitely one of my favorite books I've read so far this year."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀ tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ “To understand the world at all, sometimes you could only focus on a tiny bit of it, look very hard at what was close to hand and make it stand in for the whole.” is an emotional rollercoaster spanning 700+ pages and proof that literary lightning can indeed strike twice. Fully deserving of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, is a triumph of a novel, one that I will have a hard time reviewing (so bear with me & my ramblings). Donna Tartt seamlessly weaves together a Dickensian bildungsroman with a suspenseful and thrilling descent into the criminal underbelly of the art world (forgeries & thefts ahoy!) that boasts the same exquisite prose as her debut novel. This Odyssean coming-of-age is narrated by Theo Decker. At 13 Theo lives alone with his mother after his father, a temperamental alcoholic, decided to take up and leave New York. After Theo gets in trouble at his school he and his mother are required to attend a ‘conference’. On the way there, the two end up in a museum, for what should have been a quick gander. When a bomb explodes in the museum many die, including Theo’s mother. Once Theo awakes from the explosion he comes across a dying old man who urges him to take Carel Fabritius's ‘The Goldfinch’. Theo, probably suffering from a head concussion & shock, does as he’s bid, takes the painting. When Theo is informed of his mother’s death he’s devastated. He has no idea where his deadbeat father is and his grandparents have made it clear that they aren’t keen on having him stay with them. Theo is temporarily placed in the custody of his childhood friend's family, the Barbours, a hideously wealthy family. Later on, his father re-emerges and whisks away from New York to Las Vegas. Here Theo is left very much to his own devices, his father—who is clearly involved in some dodgy stuff—and his girlfriend do not seem particularly fond or interested in him and his upbringing. Theo becomes friends with Boris who, like him, does not have a stable home life. Together the two experiment with alcohol and drugs and commit petty crimes. We follow Theo until his late-teens and then we encounter him again as a young(ish) adult who becomes entangled in some dangerous business that force him to fully confront the kind of person that he has become. What to say? My heart went out to Theo. Yes, later in life he’s a bit of an asshole. That doesn’t cancel out all of his other qualities and complexities. Those sections recounting his boyhood are truly heartbreaking. The despair he feels at his mother’s death, the guilt, grief, longing, self-hatred, and loneliness that seem to punctuate his days are captured with exacting precision. His meditations on life, art, the people around him are striking, and I appreciated how nuanced a person he was. His relationship with Boris was one of the highlights of his narrative. It is incredible just how good Tartt is at making you care for people who are just not that nice. The dynamic between Theo and Boris is intense and messy (possibly more than a friendship?) and despite their different temperaments their similar circumstances and self-destructive tendencies fortify their bond (they are definitely good at enabling each other). His mother’s death haunts Theo throughout his life, and we see just how his survivor’s guilt affects and influences him. To Theo, the painting of ‘The Goldfinch’ is irrevocably connected to her death, which is why he’s unable to part ways with it. He's also hopelessly enamoured with Pippa, who he first glimpsed in the museum on that fateful day. She's one of the few people who understands the guilt that plagues him so. Alas, he comes to idealise in a not so healthy way. His story is filled with stops-and-starts, addiction and suicidal ideation & tendencies punctuate his life, and as an adult, he seems already to have taken a dubious path. I loved this novel. Tartt’s writing is divine. Her prose is simultaneously elegant and exhilarating, her characterization, dialogues, descriptions, are all truly exemplary. She brings to life the people, places, and situations she writes of in a way that is almost too real, so that when forces outside of my control (the end of my lunch break or commute.) put an end to my reading time, well, it felt like a rude awakening. As I said, this novel is long. A brick some would say (the hardback edition could seriously injure someone). Yet, I breezed through this. Not because it was easy reading, quite the contrary. Tartt’s erudite references and elaborate storytelling deserve attention and consideration, one cannot just rush their way through her books. And yet, I had a hard time putting this book down. Theo’s voice won me over so that I too found myself mirroring whatever he was feeling (usually sadness and or anxiety, yay). I didn’t want to let go of him, and I was actually sad once I reached the novel’s conclusion. While Tartt doesn’t go light on her characters, I could tell just how much she cares for them. The people inhabiting her novels may not necessarily be good or kind but by the end, I always end up loving them (despite or because of their many many flaws). Even characters I want to hate with the whole of my being are not wholly unredeemable. Tartt’s incisive reflections on human nature, life, grief, love, fate, art, death, struck me for their poignancy and thoughtfulness. The rich cast of characters is just as deserving of attention as Theo himself. Regardless of the part, they play in Theo's life, whether they are a friend, acquaintance, or a complete stranger, they are depicted in such vivid detail that they do not feel like fictional characters but real people. And Theo, ragazzo mio! On the one hand, many of his feelings, states of mind, motivations, fears & desires are rendered with clarity, on the other, well, the boy is not only traumatised but incredibly repressed and prone to self-deception. So, there are many moments when we cannot trust entirely his narration. His alcohol consumption and drug use also add a murky quality to certain events or portions of his story. Theo's intentional and unintentional untrustworthiness, in many ways, added an element of ambiguity to his narration and has us relying, more often than not, on other characters in order to discern the truth about certain people/events. I was captivated by Theo's story, the many lows and few highs of his adolescence and adulthood, and by the motifs dotting his narrative. The novel is also full of juxtaposition: the classic vs modern references, the bustling streets of New York, always buzzing with activity, vs the desolate landscapes of Las Vegas, the Barbours' apartment with Theo's father house. Like TSH, one of the novel's main concerns is beauty (the power that beautiful things have on us, the way we feel about that which is beautiful to us, the things we are willing to do for beauty or to have what we think beautiful). Beautiful, moving, wonderfully chaotic, a work of art. is all of these things and so much more. ps: curiously enough the first time I read it I only gave it 3 stars...and I can’t really explain why this time around I loved it so much that even days later I find myself thinking about Theo & Boris."

WHAT A TIME. There were parts I really really loved about this book and parts I didn't really enjoy. I think overall I more loved it than didn't like it. Let's talk about the bad first, shall we? For the most part I really enjoy literary fiction, but sometimes there is a lot of really unnecessary information. This book is an example of that. While I definitely think it should still be a long book because it means more that way with how the story is told, probably 100-200 pages could've been shaved off because there were so many boring parts that were rough to get through and didn't really contribute to the story. When it was good it was FANTASTIC but when it was slow it was ROUGH. Theo was a pretty interesting main character, but he had a bad case of ""nice guy"" syndrome, especially when it came to Pippa. Quite a bit of entitlement there which just rubbed me the wrong way and made me cringe a lot. NOW FOR DA GOOD STUFF. The writing and story and world building were WONDERFUL. I felt like I was immersed in the story from page one and could see everything happening and imagine it. The writing was really beautiful but still easy to understand, which is not always the case with adult or literary fiction books. LOVEEE. The characters were phenomenal and seeing their journey over the years, especially Theo, was so great. I really enjoyed the story but I don't really want to say a ton about it because I think it's better NOT to know a lot about it going in. Suffice it to say this book is really engaging and the overall plot is so so interesting. And there you have it! I've said my piece. Loved parts of it, really disliked other parts of it. Overall a pretty solid read."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is filled with addiction. To love and to beauty, to drugs and to alcohol. Addiction to fear and doubt and to pain and loss. The story illustrates how one big trauma can splinter off into myriad little dramas and how, finally, the act of tiring of the dervish dance of it all forces an inward journey to the bottom where a small light can guide the person through. This book won’t be read in a day, but the fascination with the protagonist’s journey is likely to be remembered for much, much longer. I recommend this to everyone who has ever wondered how “people get that way” or why “people do what they do”. An amazing read from beginning to end. Well done, Ms Tartt."

I'm kidding here, mostly. As is plenty usual for Tartt, this book straddles the fine line between graphomania pseudovulgaris and instaclassics of the higher style. The ones one can fall in love with and never ever part. Never again. Excellent that I adore her style, even for its hyperwordiness. I love words, her words and worlds, especially meaningful ones. And Tartt... she manages to include pretty much every shade of anything into her books. Paradoxically, to awesome effect! I've no idea just how she manages to pull it off. Must be that quite a lot of advanced Charms went into this text. You know, to get that pesky, frisky reader spellbound, deskbound, bookbound. I can just imagine the monologue: 'You won't be allowed to get back to your life, your business, your anything untill you finish your reading! Mwa-ha-ha!' Yes, there are many points of this book that are weaker than they probably should be but who am I kidding? I looooooved this novel and I totally can slide the points that I didn't care about. Review to be continued. RTF, TBD, bye. I'll be back for more of this rereadworthy goodiness junk!"

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I hate to be a buzzkill, but I don’t understand all the buzz about this insanely long book. Theo is a kid who survives a terrorist bomb that claims his mother’s life. He acquires a famous painting that tortures him. Theo’s father is a loser from Las Vegas; his best friend is a Ukrainian named Boris. Both his father and Boris use Theo, and they are dangerous, scary, and addicted. Theo? Well, he’s a lost soul who, as he grows up, acquires more than an ounce of sleaze himself. The locales are so disparate: Theo jumps from New York City to Las Vegas and back to New York again, with a horrifying visit to Amsterdam when he’s an adult. I read Tartt’s two earlier works and loved them, but that was a long time ago. Maybe now that I’m an old lady, time is too precious and I don’t want to waste it reading an 800-pager. Is Tartt’s language beautiful? Oh yes. Are her characters interesting and complex? Yes again. Can she create a complicated and far-out plot with a lot of twists and turns at the end? For sure. And her ability to paint a picture is magnificent. She’s one smart cookie. Okay, now for the bad news. Like Erdrich in “The Round House,” Tartt takes herself way too seriously. I’d say she’s a show-off, trying to impress us with her intellect instead of keeping the characters moving and talking. And even though I don’t expect to laugh with every book, a little levity would have been nice. It’s all deadly serious. And depressing as hell. And the scenery! Descriptions go on and on, forever! Although I admired her sometimes beautiful stream-of-consciousness, I won’t remember any of it—not the rooms or the streets or the furniture or the art. I require good dialogue and action in order to stay transfixed, and here they play second fiddle to descriptions. I especially hated how she analyzed paintings at the beginning of the book—it felt like Art History 101, where you get a detailed lecture on each person and thing in a painting. Yes, I “get the picture,” but I want to move out of the museum and into a conversation. And I completely resented the lessons in philosophy, which were particularly heavy at the end of the book. Okay, so she puts forth some brilliant ideas about good and evil, but I want the characters, not the author, to show it to us—the “show us, don’t tell us” rule of good writing. Tartt manages early on to get you hooked on Theo, but he makes such horrible choices it’s hard to keep rooting for him. And then there’s the question of whether he’s even a nice guy. I almost gave up on him (and the book) more than once. For a lot of people, it doesn’t matter whether heroes are “nice” or not, but for me, they have to be nice or else I don’t want to hang out with them for hours—and in this case, weeks and weeks. This monster book took me a month to finish. I never looked forward to curling up with this book; it was more like dread. Throw in a lot of frustration (get to the point already), annoyance (why is Theo making such stupid decisions?), and a big dose of anxiety (Help! How can Theo survive this mess he’s made for himself? Will the painting get ruined or lost forever?), and you end up with one big uncomfortable read. Though tempted many times, I didn’t abandon the book. I was hooked enough to want to find out how it ended. And I suspect I’ll remember this story (but not the endless descriptions) for a long while, and for that I’ll give it a 3. Just barely."

What can I even say? I mean the damn thing won the PULITZER for crying out loud - there's not a whole lot my shitty little review can do to either undercut or validate that kind of prestige. So, what am I left with? I guess I'll address the complaints. Yes, contains about eleven billion four hundred twenty-seven pages. Ms. Tartt is most definitely a fan of words. If you don't like long books, I can't guaranty you'll like this one just because of its award-winning status. Yes, is not bambambambambam when it comes to action. There are lulls in the storyline . . . but when I think about which parts should have been culled from the novel, I can't name a one. Everything that happens does so for a reason - you just have to read the whole thing to figure it out. And finally, yes the characters are not sympathetic. If you enjoy development that makes you fall in love with the main characters, this (once again) probably will not be your bag. I, however, a good unlikeable character and lucky for me was full of them. Bottom line is, I'm not so brave as to recommend this to really any one. All I can say is that I'm glad I decided to not be intimidated either by the size or the fact that the author was unknown to me and give it a shot. I'm also thankful I never dropped this one on my little toe ; ) Hey, looky there. I wrote an entire review with no .gifs. I'm super legit now."

Worth its weight in Gold. Why does this book not even have a straight five star rating? Really? So I got through this book which, as everybody knows is...quite long. It is an extraordinary read. I am always saying not to judge another person for what they may or may not like but I have to admit I broke my own rule. Many One star ratings on here? I was surprised. I loved it, all 700 pages plus..what a long read! Beautiful, amazing, and so complex. Theo is am amazingly drawn character and so complex. It is hard not to adore him. He is lonely and alone and in search of redemption and he is oh so lovable. Gold Finch was exquisite. I read A secret History shortly afterward and while it was OK I really think this is her masterpiece. I am very glad she won the Pulitzer because if any book deserves it, it is this one. I have not seen the film version yet but it is on my radar. If you have not read this yet, clear your schedule and five in. It's some beautiful stuff. Five Golden stars."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"When I found out that Donna Tartt had written a new book, I was stoked. I loved The Secret History. Alas, this book was a disaster. A rambling, poetically incoherent mess to be exact. First, to all you folks that get huffy about reviews on books only partially read. I don't have to eat a whole meal to know I hate it, one bite makes me want to gag. I don't have to read every page to know I hate a book either. If I had to pick a book that literary snobs would place on their shelves as prime examples of 'quality writing', this would be the book I'd pick. I don't imply that only literature snobs like this book, but I've found they come out in droves to defend this drivel with stellar retorts like ""Ugh, obviously you should just read Reader's Digest"" or ""Weak minded readers with ADD might not like this"" or, my favorite ""You just don't understand the deeper meaning, you simple-minded fool."" Nope, I don't because I'm not digging through 700 pages of nicely written nonsense to find it. Would you like to read 14 pages about the smell and feel of the back seat of a taxi? This book is for you. (it'd be quicker to go flag down a taxi and sniff the seats) Would you like to have an art lecture from a pretentious fictional woman who is making up crap left and right about the 'deeper' meaning of each work of art? This book is for you. Have you ever deeply desired to hear every fleeting thought of a whiny, depressed boy who worries, gripes, and reminisces about nothing. This book is for you! Have you ever wanted to know how to use 65 adjectives to describe an empty hallway? This book is for you! Are you stuck on an abandoned island with only this book or Fifty Shades of Grey to read? This book is for you!! Do you want to read a book that assumes you have ZERO ability to imagine ANYTHING on your own? This book is for you. Below I have written a hasty example of how wordy this book is. The goal of the sentence(which quickly becomes a paragraph): To move our character from the sidewalk to the bridge. Yeah, basic stuff to root the reader in a setting. What you actually get: ""The rain poured down from black, heavy clouds. Like Zeus himself was suffering the pains I felt. The slick drops dance on my forehead as I stared into the cloudy,chaotic abyss. Tiny, shimmery, wet tears splashed into the puddles around my worn, (French Brand name of choice), rustic, beloved leather shoes, making ripples like the cosmos. Ahh, the cosmos, so vast, so infinite, so lonely. Like the cicadas in the moonlight of my childhood home. Ah, my home, which brings only dark memories of my father. That wretch, now living on house-boat on the Thames, selling yo-yos to passing children. The yo-yo, so symbolic of life and death, yin and yang. It reminds me of the first time I had Chinese food in a small restaurant in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, the smell of hard work and dead leaves. Dead leaves, a subtle reminder of the finite, fragile lives we lead. Everything ends, everything dies, everything is silence. Like the silence of the bridge, which I head to. I see a bird, a dove, like the ones in [some old painting] . . . "" Are you getting irritated yet!! I am and I'm writing it! EDIT: I read the link from the comments section and, sorry Miss Huffing Post, I still think the book sucks. ""Expectation, that is the true soul of art."" What I expected and what I got didn't play well."

We can’t make ourselves want what’s good for us or what’s good for other people. We don’t get to choose the people we are.” Donna Tartt publishes a book once every decade, or that's the pattern she's followed since her first book (published in 1992) and then her second (published in 2002) and now this (published in 2013). She's said she doesn't enjoy the process of creating a book in a faster manner and if she is not enjoying it then the reader won't either. If the outcome is always like this (and I say this, not having read her previews works) then I'll patiently wait a decade, a hundred years, if that's what I have to do in order to read a book of hers. I took my time with this book. I read it slowly, I didn't want to rush into it. Instead I focused on the writing, which is mouth-watering and at times I just couldn't help myself and read more than I initially intended to. I did not want this book to finish. This entire novel, it's a swirl of emotions. Emotions, feelings I can't even name. It was witty, it was deep, it was strange, it was bleak, it made me cry, it made me think about my life hard and take notes at what I have accomplished so far in. I was savoring the prose, I'd read each sentence twice just to make sure that it was embedded in a place somewhere in my mind. Beware, don't pick this expecting to find plot twists and action. Pick this up expecting to read a book with important life lessons. It's the realest of books. Mrs. Tartt composes characters and situations come alive from real life. Realistic prose and realistic people under realistic circumstances, it's what this book is. Shall I introduce you to the plot? Theodore Decker is a normal 13-year-old boy whose father has abondoned him and his mother, so, it's just the two of them together now. Add some tragedies. And a work of art. Browse slowly throughout Theo's life until his late teens and then fast forward to his adulthood. Mix in plenty of mistakes and rush decisions. A bleak and macabre atmosphere. Life lessons. Voila. I don't want to let you onto many details. I want you guys to pick this book up with no clue whatsoever and read it and then let your feelings sink in and your mind soak in the meaning underneath this incredible piece of literature. Let the characters come alive in your mind and let the writing take you to dark places where life isn't as happy as we think it is, at least not for everyone. It's such a powerful book. I will admit I was hesitant about reading this because I hadn't heard so many great things about it and reviews were mixed but I think people got into this prejudiced against the dark nature of the book, as it is indeed dark and it ventures into really twisted paths. Let me give you an advice. Free your mind of any kind of prohibition. Go into this book with a clear head off any kind of prejudice against what you think you know and understand. Don't read this unless you are going to do it so in the book's native language, meaning English. I've read numerous books in both English and my native language and I've noticed that things get lost in translation, countless details and of course an author loses their personal touch. This book is all about the writing, if you read a translated version of it then I fear it'll only give you a headache and a bad case of diarrhea. That's it. I don't know. I may return tomorrow, or in two months or in seven years to add something about what this book instilled in me because I'll make sure to carrie it along with me for a long time."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I think I have a strategy now for long books - to listen to the audiobook while reading. Seriously, it works. I did it previously for Under the Dome by Stephen King, which made the experience all the more enjoyable and cinematic, and I started doing it around halfway through with The Goldfinch because frankly, I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to keep taking long breaks from reading while I was out and about or at work. Because I mean , this book is a beast and a bit too heavy to lug about. So here we are, I have finally completed my last Donna Tartt book. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes. Am I looking forward to her next release (probably at some point in my 30s)? Hell yes again. isn't my favourite book of Tartt's that I've read so far, but I think it's fair to say that it's her most accomplished to date. After all, this is her most recent book, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014. It is sweeping in its scale, a true coming-of-age tale that fans of that kind of book will probably lap up. The novel follows Theo Decker, a young boy who after a tragic accident loses his mother, and acquires an incredibly famous painting - The Goldfinch - in the process. From here we follow him as he narrates his life many years on, seeing his damaged childhood and the man that he will eventually become. I think it's best to leave things there with regards to a plot summary, because I think this book is best enjoyed with as little knowledge of the plot as possible. Also, word of warning, - the first paragraph of the whole page, never mind the plot summary, will spoil later events for you. Yes, I was annoyed. It didn't ruin my experience per sé, but I definitely would have rather not known certain things. I thought Theo Decker was a very well-rounded character, and definitely a protagonist that you could both sympathise with and thoroughly dislike. He makes some terrible decisions, he treats people badly, but at the centre of it all he has a lot of heart, and cares and loves things and people incredibly deeply. I thought the pain he experienced through losing his mother was detailed incredibly well, and I truly felt for him as he navigated a variety of troubling experiences throughout his childhood. However, I think it's fair to say that it's not Theo Decker that makes this book - it's the secondary characters, his friends and companions through life. Boris is probably my favourite character in the whole book - sarcastic, passionate, caring, and a bit of a loose canon. He is also adorably Russian/Ukrainian/Australian... yeah, it makes sense when you read it. And then there is of course Hobie - I have a soft spot for older, slightly eccentric gentlemen, and Hobie fit the bill perfectly. I wanted him to be my dad pretty much, and I loved the audiobook narrator David Pittu's portrayal of him. As a character he warms your heart and makes you smile. Also, I think Popper/Popchik deserves a mention - what a cutie. There are definitely some serious themes covered in this book - bereavement, drug and alcohol abuse, gambling, and crime. I like all those things in books, because I am a bit on the miserable side, so if you like uplifting happy books, maybe this isn't the one for you. But if you want a literary fiction novel on the grand side of things, coming-of-age stories with less than likeable protagonists, and some truly great dialogue, then I think you will enjoy . I'm definitely glad I finally got round to it."

Well, because The Secret History is one of the best books ever written and The Little Friend is, by far, one of THE worst books ever written. It was so jarring to have two such drastic reading experiences, and while people told me not to worry about the Goldfinch, I held back for six years. ⠀ That being said, I’m so glad I finally got around to this book. It was an incredibly easy reading experience, and even when things suddenly felt a little tedious within a big book, Tartt would suddenly throw a major plot twist your way and keep you engaged the whole time. I don’t know how Tartt’s writing manages to keep the reader continuously invested the whole time — it’s an incredibly rare talent — and The Goldfinch showcases her skill magnificently. Is it as good as The Secret History? Not by a long shot. But is it an extremely interesting and enjoyable read? Absolutely."

Theo, the main character, survives a catastrohic event and tries to put the pieces of his life back together, making many mistakes along the way. I related to him, his loss, his search for The Goldfinch, which connected him to his past and former unbroken life. Some of the writing was laborious, but the story was moving. Theo makes amends and knows he must keep moving forward, recognizing that everyone lives imperfect lives but must hold on to joyous memories. The author tell us ""that life-whatever it is-is short... immerse ourselves anyway; wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open."" I believe Theo did that."

The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"70th book of 2020. On top of the standard thrill of finishing a nearly 900 page novel, there’s a rush of a lot more here: more than could ever be put into words in this review. As for buzzword themes, this novel has: Love, friendship, unrequited love, drugs, addiction, family, suffering, guilt, grief, mourning, affairs, criminals, gambling, mortality, history, parenthood, and of course, art... And probably more. But let’s start lightly, shall we? The Beatles are my favourite band. My mother is a Scouser. I spent a lot of holidays up in Liverpool as a child. In fact, now is a good time to say how proud I am that several months ago Spotify informed me that out of the 20 million monthly listeners, I am in the top 1% in the , for the amount of The Beatles listened. Is that impressive or do I need to branch out? Boris, one of my new favourite Tartt characters loves which is also one of my top Beatles tracks (I have about forty ‘top’ tracks). And now, will forever remind me of Boris. I’d say most words I use to describe The Beatles: nostalgic, melancholic, hopeful, cathartic, broken-hearted…Well, they all apply here, too. Having now read all three of her novels ( / ), this is now a slight ode to Tartt. As a child, she had memorised poems by A.A. Milne, then Poe, and now can recite T.S. Eliot and Dante. Her novels are often likened to Dickens – yes, they are Dickensian. The Observer regards as a . Of course it is also called a and a But Tartt, despite her success, is another mysterious/reclusive writer to add to the list with the likes of Pynchon, Salinger, Ferrante. There are many websites (of course) named things like – , and, this one, which I’ve just made up now, (see what I did there?). As intrigued as I am about Tartt, I’m glad she’s mysterious. The little things I do know about her are enough. She’s done interviews, of course – I watched one after reading and was surprised by the thickness of her Southern accent – but on the whole, she is largely out of the immediate ‘limelight’. Concerning , I’ve read that she lived in New York hotels whilst writing it (almost ‘method’ writing) and that, like her other books, took her around ten years to write, which she thinks is the amount of time it takes to create. In fact, she said she began writing around her first novel’s press tour – twenty years earlier. Because Tartt isn’t just creating a , she’s creating a universe; the world inside this book is as real as the world outside of it. Every character exploded into wonderful fruition, even Popper. We also know Tartt has a dog – pictured above – Pongo, who I hope is the very inspiration for Popper. This book is about Theodore Decker, but its also about the painting, The Goldfinch, and it's also about life itself, and art itself. And despite these themes, which seem to fade away in the narrative at times, because we become so immersed in the characters and the plot, are actually there the whole time - bubbling under the surface. Tartt is gifted with the ability to write both a page turner, with beautiful language, and a literary masterpiece. It has taken me just over a week to read 864 pages. And though the pages flew by, the impact did not. Finally, rushing to the end of the novel, everything building towards its peak - everything behind you, is now on your back. You live Theo's life with him, and you carry everything he has with him, too. I wish I could say more about the ending, but I won't. It's not the end of the 'story' that got me, but the revelations. I wish I could put the characters in this book into words but I can't. Only by reading this, by living with them, will you understand. There's a lot more I want to say, but won't, or can't. I am now without another Tartt book to read, which saddens me a lot. Though, by her ten year standards, it might not be long. For those who have read this and enjoyed it, I expect you look at this little bird very differently. So, not only is changed, but this painting too. So, bravo Tartt, a masterpiece. It's only fitting that this review is closed with the bird who started it all - chained, looking right at you. Wonder why he exists, why he is chained, and, what it says about Fabritius? Or even, ?"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Goldfinch contains multitudes. It’s the Dickensian coming-of-age tale of a hero much like David Copperfield who’s “possessed of a heart that can’t be trusted.” It’s a realist record of criminal escapades. It’s a story of unrequited love. It’s a convincing first-hand picture of anxiety, addiction and regret. It has a great road trip, an endearing small dog, and a last line that rivals ’s. It’s a meditation on time, fate and the purpose of art. It’s not perfect, and yet I – even as someone who pretty much never rereads books – can imagine reading this again in the future and gleaning more with hindsight. That makes it worthy of one of my rare 5-star recommendations. [My pristine paperback copy cost all of £1 at a used bookshop. Talk about entertainment value for money!] (See my full review at my blog, .)"

I wanted to love this book, I included it in my 5-star predictions video, that's how much I thought I was going to love it. I gave this book several tries, I read 300 pages of it and I just can't do it anymore. I'm bored out of my mind. This story follows a young boy named Theo who becomes an orphan suddenly and his life gets completely thrown off it's course because of it. The book started off interesting enough, with the dramatic scenes of how Theo became an orphan. Then, after the 100 page mark this book falls into this sluggish drag and it becomes the kind of book that will take twenty pages to describe the most mundane details about everything that you don't give a shit about. Even though this book relies on you to feel something for Theo, . I don't know why, I just never connected to his character. All of the characters in this book feel that way - so distant, like you can't really connect with any of them. By page 300 with all the scenes of him and Boris in Vegas I was so bored out of my mind I decided to stop reading it. Life it too short to finish 700 page books that I am not enjoying. So there's that, I'm disappointed. I guess Donna Tartt books are just not my thing."

The writing was inspired, the support cast of characters brilliant and the story riveting."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another? In Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel , young Theo Decker's life is thrown into disarray and changed forever when his mother is killed in a terrorist bombing at a New York Museum. Theo manages to survive, and escapes the museum with Carel Fabritius' 1654 painting, which bears the same name as the novel. The book covers the immediate aftermath of the explosion and drifts into Theo's adult years, being something of a coming-of-age story in its scope. For me, this book was a very mixed bag, but did I like it or dislike it? Let's go over the positives and negatives. First, the positives: One thing I never expected when I started reading was that it would turn out to be a quintessential New York novel, but to me it is. I've read a number of New York based books over the years: by Jonathan Lethem, by Paul Auster, and by Don DeLillo, to name a few, but I don't think I've come across a book that gave me as much of the New York vibe as this book did. Tartt actually lives in New York, and displays an extensive knowledge of its streets, businesses, museums, and etc. Sometimes it felt like she was just info dumping (street name, street name, theater name, etc.), but there were moments where she'd describe something seemingly insignificant like garbage cans, or the traffic noises, or a street vendor selling hot dogs, that really put me there and gave me the city ""vibe"". Out of all the many characters in this book, two stood out to me: Boris and Mrs. Barbour. Boris brought humour and endless energy; he is flawed, and basically a criminal, but he always gave me the feeling that everything was going to be okay, no matter how bad things got for him and Theo. He had a naive self-confidence that I personally found endearing. Mrs. Barbour, on the other hand, is a very different character, cold and calculating but with a big heart, which was revealed in her constant shielded of a young Theo from the fallout of the attack. Of the two, Boris is the stronger character, and I would argue he is the only truly great character in the entire novel (sorry Hobie). The themes covered in this book are seemingly infinite and deeply thought-provoking. Love, death, beauty. How none of us ever get what we really want in life. Fate, destiny, fortune, chance, heredity and its impact on who we become. Friendship, morality, brotherhood. Grief, loss, heartbreak. Tartt explores a wide range of fascinating and powerful themes in this novel, and she's incredibly brave for doing so, as many of them are not easy ground to cover. Donna Tartt made me care about and really look forward to seemingly trivial things in this book that many would find boring, like when Theo met Mrs. Barbour again after many years away from their family. I really looked forward to that conversation, and Tartt's cultivation of such an investment in the story proves that she is a great writer. That covers the good. But what about the bad? Some aspects of story simply don't make sense. The father left Theo and his mother a year ago or more, and there was mention that money was tight, and that the father wasn't paying any kind of support to them...but they can somehow afford to live in a downtown New York apartment with white gloved doormen? And there's mention that the mother has numerous bottles of ""overpriced"" shampoo in the bathroom. How can she afford them? And Kitsey, whose every action paints her as a vain, conceited, empty-headed imbecile. But Tartt later on goes to lengths in numerous different scenes of dialogue to explicitly state how intelligent Kitsey is? She sounds like a character from to me, so how is she simultaneously this highly intelligent person? It's completely incongruous. Early on in the book, Theo also seems way too grown up, like Tartt wanted to write an adult character but her story called for a teenager because it was a coming-of-age narrative. He does really mature things that no thirteen year old would do, like buying and sending his mother flowers on her birthday. Are you kidding me? I didn't have my own money until I was sixteen and had my first job. Where did he get the money for it? He doesn't even have a job. Flowers from a florist aren't cheap. Also just the way he talks and conducts himself. He's clearly mature well beyond his years, which to me didn't make a whole lot of sense and wasn't very unrealistic. And the story Boris weaves to describe his years away from Theo, when they finally meet again in New York, is absolutely ridiculous and similarly unrealistic. Multiple kids at his high school going into rehab? What the hell...kids in high school are like fourteen? Is America really so messed up that fourteen year old kids in high school are using cocaine and going into rehab en masse? And Boris ended up working for the guy who was coming to the Vegas house with a henchman who had a baseball bat, looking for Theo's dad so he could ""extract"" the money he owes him? Seriously? That's the last person on Earth he'd end up working for in real life. It's a ridiculous, nonsensical tale, and it took me completely out of the story. And what about the henchmen, who have twenty thousand dollar watches, or how Theo, a furniture salesmen, can somehow afford to buy Pippa a thirty thousand dollar necklace. Donna Tartt is aware these are enormous sums of money, right? And that no shifty, small-time, underworld henchman from Amsterdam would ever be able to afford a watch anywhere near that valuable, right? Apparently she does not. She might as well have made it a one hundred thousand dollar watch; it would have been just as ridiculous. The chapters in this book are insanely large, with some actually being over 100 pages long (one, at 169 pages, was 17.5% of the book's entire length). This, to me, is cruel and unusual punishment. On numerous occasions in this book, characters text message each other on their mobile phones, and this texting is incredibly strange. It's as if Tartt thinks text messages for some reason have a 30 character limit or something; characters were constantly cutting their words down and eliminating letters, substituting in numbers instead, or just cutting the letters out with no substitutions so the words were sometimes almost indecipherable. I'm fairly certain that no one on Earth texts this way, and I thought it was just bizarre. This book is unbelievably repetitive, and in numerous different ways: Everyone always talking over the other person in dialogue, it was always raining (no matter which country the story was taking place in; there were two different ones), dialogue with one word (it was often the same three or four words throughout the novel, ad nauseum) and then an emdash, for example: ""Um—"" ""I—"" ""Well—"" ""Because—"" Theo never eating anything or only eating a few bites of an entire meal, like he never has an appetite or has a condition or something, neverending Dickens references, hundreds (thousands?) of silences and instances of staring awkwardly at the other person in conversational dialogue between characters. Donna Tartt took over to write this novel; how could she possibly not be aware the book was this repetitive, and not revise it to eliminate hundreds of instances of the above repetitions? They were glaringly obvious to me after probably less than a hundred pages, and this book is almost a thousand pages long. For someone who claims to do extensive editing herself, this is simply inexcusable on Donna Tartt's part and, quite frankly, is baffling. Theo's obsession with Pippa was endearing at first, given their unique and lifelong bond with each other, but it later became increasingly creepy and incredibly pathetic. The early New York section at the beginning of the book, and the Vegas section, were well done, but when Theo comes back to New York after Vegas the story goes to hell; the story slows to a crawl and depicts incredibly boring events, like carousing in bars and shopping for weddings. Long, tedious dinner and barroom conversations spanning many pages, filled with vapid, boring dialogue. It almost seemed like an entirely different author wrote the second half of the book. This is supposed to be Theo's story, but the supporting characters left a lot bigger impact on me than Theo, who I found to be a very bland, lifeless character that I didn't care about in the slightest. Enough said. I can only read characters consuming copious amounts of alcohol and various types of hard drugs so many times before it starts to sicken me. And it probably happened hundreds of times in this book. There's no two ways about it: this book is at least 200 pages too long. Segments of 10-20 pages of Theo and Boris just drinking in a bar, 40 pages of Theo moping and worrying in his Amsterdam hotel about what happened to Boris, the 20 page philosophical rant at the very end of the book, and so much more...it just didn't need to be there. This book needed some serious editing, and never should have been published at anywhere near this length. The ending was very disappointing: a dense, barely readable, over-thinking analysis of the painting and its meaning, several lazy, two-or-three sentence blurbs mentioning major characters and storylines, like the Barbours or Pippa's relationship with Theo, characters and storylines you've just spent almost a thousand pages with, only to have their stories left unresolved and underexplored by the end of the book, and a boring, self-contradicting narrative about how life sucks and it's better never to have been born, but you can be happy and enjoy life? Huh? In conclusion, Donna Tartt's is sometimes hailed as an epic masterpiece of sweeping scope, but I thought it was more like Howard Hughes' plane, the Spruce Goose. It's impressive in a way, and incredibly heavy, and it can take off and briefly soar, but it's ultimately flawed, crashing back down under its immense weight (or, in this case, its length). It was enjoyable at times, but I was disappointed overall, and will likely never go back to it in the future. That being said, Donna Tartt is clearly a skilled writer, and I look forward to reading her other books, all of which I've already purchased."

Write straight into the emotional center of things. Write toward vulnerability. Risk being unliked. Tell the truth as you understand it. If you’re a writer you have a moral obligation to do this. And it is a revolutionary act—truth is always subversive.” --Anne Lamott The best fiction reveals hard truths. Readers seeking sugar-coated fiction should move along; not a grain of sugar can be found in Donna Tartt’s gutsy , a shining example of literary fiction at its most resonant. Tartt’s no-holds-barred depiction is the furthest thing from sanitized, yet--a big --it contains hope, love, and redemption, and more than mere glimmers of those. There are numerous characters to be riveted by, love, and even laugh at. But it simply cannot be denied that hard truth overflows in this bold work: coarse, detailed descriptions of copious drug use and alcoholism; instances of physical abuse and regular cursing. In its depiction of one boy’s life of yearning, despair, and utter loneliness following his mother’s death, this almost-800 page book is as real as any book gets. The book begins when protagonist Theo is thirteen and covers the events of his life over many years, ending when he is somewhere in his mid-to-late twenties. In this way it is a kind of “pseudo-coming-of-age story.” Compelling characters, realistic and plentiful dialogue, and a sustained low-level of suspense (ratcheted higher at points) translate to a gripping page-turner. Added to that are some genuine shocks, plus at least one huge twist, that guarantee this book will be a memorable one. Theo is unmoored after his mother’s death, never truly finding his footing in life, though stumbling through worse at some times than at others. is striking on countless levels, not least of which is its stunningly authentic portrayal of bereavement: Ultimately, the book is a fearless examination of what happens in the aftermath of a devastating loss. However, despite the main character’s cynical outlook and continuous struggle with depression, the book itself is not depressing. Possibly this is because enough of ’s other characters act as a calming counterbalance. Every character in this book rings true-to-life--distinct and dynamic, very much alive. They run the gamut; there are the gentle and virtuous to love, the villainous to hate, and the struggling to root for. One exceedingly wealthy way of life contrasts glaringly with another that is painfully down-and-out. Only the deftest of writers can infuse these portrayals with the complexity and nuance necessary for them to ring true. Tartt more than succeeded here. She has an astonishingly keen eye for detail, and her descriptive talent is nothing short of jolting: Such striking characterization will not come as a surprise to fans of Tartt’s , her first book and a masterpiece in its own right, though different from in nearly every way. Typical for Tartt is to take several years to write one book. took her eight years to write; took a bit longer--ten years, and the same is true of . That slow-and-steady effort more than paid off; her exquisitely fluid prose is truly some of the best, somehow seeming even more impressive when one considers the glut of forgettable “quick-money” books jamming today’s bookstore shelves. The hardcover book even feels like a work of art itself; the font and cover art is elegant and clean, and the pages have a satin-like quality. Additionally, as with Tartt’s other books, has wide appeal. Unfortunately, the story isn’t without flaw. Although it does conclude on a satisfying note, with an excellent sense of closure, its final ten or so pages are its weakest. Here Tartt veered into a rambling, sometimes overly abstract lecture that seems, more than anything, to be her personal musings on the connection between art and life. Why this section is necessary is a mystery when her story has already driven home this point. This section could have been shortened by at least half with no loss, if not removed altogether. Tartt masterfully “showed” and didn’t “tell” throughout , yet here she did the exact opposite, and the result makes for some boring reading. Nevertheless, this is the one and only misstep in an otherwise supreme five-star work and hardly reason to dismiss it. : “Donna Tartt Talks, A Bit, About ”: Attendance at the Frick museum soars thanks to Tartt’s :"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Thirteen-year-old Theo Decker's life changes dramatically when he and his mother stop by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the way to a conference at Theo's school. While browsing the gallery Theo spots an elderly gentleman (Welty) escorting a teenage girl (Pippa) with whom Theo is instantly enthralled. Shortly afterward a terrorist bomb levels part of the museum, Theo's mom is killed, and Theo - shocked and confused - makes off with a small masterpiece, Carel Fabritius's painting ""The Goldfinch"". Theo's deep mourning over the loss of his mother, his illicit possession of the beautiful masterpiece, and his infatuation with the badly injured Pippa profoundly affect his ongoing story. To me the very last part of the book - where the author philosophizes about art and beauty and life - was slow and somewhat incomprehensible. For the most part, though, this is an excellent book with a good story, well-rounded, engrossing characters and enough twists to keep the reader interested. You can follow my reviews at"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Ah, The Goldfinch: earning a startling slew of awards and sparking wars amongst literary critics. I was bound to get to it eventually. “You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life.” There is an odd beauty to Donna Tartt’s writing. Having read her debut novel , I expected something similar in terms of poignant diction and compelling morally grey characters. While keeps its title as one of my favourite standalone novels (and my favourite of Tartt’s) it cant be denied that I really enjoyed as well. While visiting an art gallery, Theo Decker and his mother fall victim to a terrorist attack. Theo survives, and in memory of his mother steals one of her favourite paintings, The Goldfinch. As time goes by, Theo cycles through homes feeling lost and without purpose. The painting is the only thing left that connects him to his mother, and giving it up is not an option. Years later Theo discovers people he isn't willing to lose, but the threat of his crime being discovered grows closer with every day that passes by. ~★~ Contemplating how to start this review was a nightmare. I’ve just burned through Theo’s very lengthy life story, and my thoughts are still racing with the aftershocks. A seven-hundred-seventy page story is no small feat, especially considering that contains eleven years worth of work. Something I adore about Donna Tartt as an author is her way of maintaining a slight degree of detachment between readers and the protagonist. You may be wondering, “doesn’t that take away from the story?” and I’d tell you no; for me it only enhances the impact. Despite being narrated in first person, Theo himself seems but a small detail in the grand scheme of things. His thoughts shape the story’s direction, yes, though it is the atmosphere paired with the people surrounding Theo that make things genius. These integral characters and their proceedings quickly become oh so compelling to the point where it is their lives you hope to follow. (I could read stories upon stories about Boris and Hobie, truly). There’s something about Tartt’s writing that is unparalleled by any other author I’ve read from. This woman must be a damn magician—never in my life did I think I’d become desperately invested in the state of a little antique shop. If Donna writes about how to properly restore a chair, you’ll feel the wood scraping your palms, picking up details of the craft. If she wants to write about sailing the vast ocean, you’ll feel the breeze caressing your face and the saltwater spraying your lips. Her imagery adds an incredible atmosphere I wont even bother attempting to articulate. In english class this year, our teacher allowed us to write our final essays analyzing a novel of our choice. It’s typical that when annotating is involved, I end up enjoying a story a whole lot less than I would have being if able to read freely. Somehow that wasn’t the case at all here. I’d been planning to read anyways, and went in knowing Tartt’s writing style is something I’m fond of. This is a slow book, as are her others, which is important to consider before jumping into this story. Otherwise, the pulitzer prize speaks for itself; several people out there have found meaning in this story. Maybe you’ll be one of them."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is honestly just too beautiful for words. It left me feeling mesmerized and listless... All I wanted to do for the first week after finishing this book was lay around and think about The Goldfinch and its vivid settings and intricate characters. I've read several reviews where people use the word ""Dickensian"" to describe this novel. Having only read by Charles Dickens in high school and absolute despising it, I'm not sure I feel comfortable tossing that word around in relation to Tartt's most recent novel. I will say, however, that while many critics found the story to be unbelievable and long-winded at times, I thought it was nothing short of riveting and wouldn't have minded another few chapters, even if they were only about Kitsey Barbour. Don't knock this one off your TBR until you've given it a good, solid go. I'd recommend giving it the trusty 100-page test and if you're not hooked by then, it's probably not the style or story for you.

Donna Tartt is not out to prove a new, quirky, literary format (well, she does play with us a bit in the last chapter). The Goldfinch is solid and traditional. She unwraps a story in which one moment’s action spirals into a lifetime of anxiety and paranoia and the protagonist (Theo) embarks on a journey of self-identity. In the midst of dark, dreary, and hopeless New York and Amsterdam settings, Tartt inserts endearing moments - Boris reunites with Popchik, Theo is nicknamed Potter, Hobie schools Theo on furniture reconstruction. Tartt ends with a profound statement about the mystery of life and beautiful thoughts on art. The Goldfinch has found the “rainbow edge where beauty comes into being, where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not: and this is the space where all art exists, and all magic.”. I have been spoiled by Tartt’s other masterpiece, The Little Friend, but I’m still giving this a 5 star."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I was expecting so much from this novel. After all, Donna Tartt only writes a novel every so often. Where to start? There is so much wrong with this mess of a book. It is too long. It has a weak, reactive protagonist for whom I felt no empathy. Theo is pitiable and unlikeable, and worst of all, he does not change. None of the characters do. It was as if I were reading a reality show full of awful characters I would not want to meet in real life, and like reality television, nothing much happens for most of the 800 pages. A major problem is also Theo’s voice. I could hear the author trying to force a male viewpoint. It didn’t work. The story starts off with a bang – literally. Theo’s mother is killed in an explosion in an art gallery in New York. His alcoholic father has recently abandoned them. Theo, at the time, has been suspended from school, and is already a petty criminal. He survives the explosion and somehow manages to steal a priceless painting as he exits the building. Theo’s life, and the story, goes from bad to worse and back to bad. There are so many unnecessary characters and irrelevant situations that I would bore you senseless describing them. If you’re willing to risk reading this wad of paper to find out who they are, good luck. I read all the way to the end, desperately hoping for Theo to display some character. I was disappointed."

Since I'm very interested in translations, it was especially cool to read the original English version and then listen to the German translation. It definitely made for a very unique reading experience! When it comes to reviewing the actual book itself, I think I'll have to think about it for a bit longer before I can give any coherent opinions. Just know that while I did think it was a bit pretentious at times, Theo's narration and the writing style ultimately managed to suck me into the story and into this world, and I'd definitely recommend the book as a whole!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Thirteen-year-old New Yorker, Theo Decker, lost his mother in an explosion in an art museum. He becomes a candidate for foster care since his father abandoned them a few years earlier. Thus begins his journey through the world of the wealthy and influential players in society, the middle-class dicey world of his dad, the lonely world of abandoned abused friends he finds in unlikely places. Through it all he clings to his memories of his mother and a painting of the little bird which his mother adored. The painting would become her. In protecting it, he also subconsciously protected the dreams his mother had for him. It became his direct line of communication with her. The last time a book caused such a buzz in my little world, was when by Frank McCourt hit the stage. Everybody, who took reading seriously, excitedly bounced up and down urging the rest of mankind to read it. Dan Brown and J. K Rawling changed everything with their versions of best sellers after that, although I was always of the opinion that they used the unique or the shocking to attract readers. There was just something about these books that captured a much wider audience than was initially targeted. It did not matter where you were, in which country, the books were part of everyone's luggage, or visible book collections on coffee tables. Friends became foes when one loved it and the other did not. I am not sure if Tartt's book will equal anything like the above-mentioned book sales, ever, but did manage to create quite a stir in a very short time in the company of bibliophiles and became a best seller simply by word of mouth alone. It almost did not need an aggressive promotional force behind it. This book sells itself. I did not want to read this book. As in *was not interested in reading it*. Simply because I did not like the mass hysterics it created. I bought Dan Brown's books and gave it away as soon as I read the first one. First time that has ever happened. I simply refused to read any Harry Potters. I also bought other Pulitzer Prize Winners and wish I had not. There was really nothing wrong with the books at all. I simply was not the right target audience for it. Books that are based on reality, deal with the truth in some or other form, or convincingly represent humanity, are the books I feel comfortable with. It helps when some sort of character represents me in the tale as well. Someone I can relate to. And if that is impossible, I appreciate it if I can at least relate to the story. Goodreads friends convinced me with their honest reviews to give this book a shot. It really was a good read. Donna Tartt is a real storyteller. She used fairytale elements to attract a serious younger crowd to a book about their reality. Her inclusion of sights and sounds, silences and smells, as well as capturing the imagination with her descriptive prose on the ambiance of their environment, brought more than a rainbow of color to the tale. Informative, detailed, well-written indeed. The suspense and adventure enabled her to expose the challenges of the modern world without losing her readers in the process. The text is undoubtedly rich. Beautiful. What bothered me? 1) I could not identify with any of the characters; 2) the milieu was toxic, yet necessary for the plot, and sadly representative of the world as we know it right now. 3) The idea was too fantastic (for my taste), quite similar to the Dan Brown books, but with way less violence and horror. It cannot be compared to Dan Brown's books, of course, simply because it was written with much more dignity and grace, in the first place. The aim of the book was quite different. It did not use controversial elements to attract attention. It did not try to shock at all. addressed reality but at the same time turned it into a fairy tale without compromising the truth of society too much. 4) The length was unnecessary, it could lose at least 150 pages. The lectures and philosophical jigsaw puzzle could have been edited out, however, she made an effort to develop every single character and change perceptions of stereotypical personalities by stretching the story out over so many additional pages. It brought balance in a way, but it still could have been shortened. 5) Speaking of which: There was some philosophical, preachy word-dumping taking place, yet I found the information about the antique furniture fascinating. But I did skip too many pages in the end where 'show don't tell' lost out to passive thoughts instead of actions. It killed the ending. 6) The characters did the opposite of what I wanted them to do. Drugs and alcohol abuse were just too much, repetitive, neverending. At one point I thought the book read like a soapie. Nobody dared to be happy, it will destroy the reason for continuing the tale. It took almost 800 pages to conclude the saga after all! The characters were repulsive as well as endearing. They touched me mentally and emotionally even though I did not want that to happen! There are other discrepancies, like mentioning the use of email and cell phones which did not quite fit the time frame of the story, as well as confusing routes between Las Vegas and New York which even looked suspect to me who have never been there. I just allowed it to slide for the greater good. But it does leave some question marks about the authenticity of the text though. I was also wondering what the author's own experiences with drugs were. The book did not shock. Nothing in it was new. What I did appreciate was the multi-leveled issues addressed. It was as though the author dragged a canvas over modern society, switched on the spotlight and presented our own dark inner world to ourselves. She highlighted the people behind the veneer. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Shakespeare said it well: I would not call it a favorite. But I will certainly recommend it as a good read. Donna Tartt knows how to construct as well as tell a story in well-executed prose. Minimalism was the key in sentence building. The story had an easy flow. I was surprised that I never really had the urge to constantly skip-read a lot of it, although I had to encourage myself to keep reading. But towards the end I skipped the moral lectures and headed for the goal posts. But good heavens, what happened to the ending? I felt like dropping the ball since I couldn't find the goal posts! EDIT: Another reviewer(calling her/himself 'Longhare'on GR) summed up the ending like this: That is exactly how I felt after closing the book. The author failed the ending by doing this! I just wanted a more structured, more 'happier' ending after all the hardship and trauma. But then it would have deceived the reality, right? Optimism. I so wanted the good to triumph! Alas, it would then not have been considered for the Pullitzer Prize. I get that. But still !The story just faded out. Who knows where the ending went!? I did not fall in love with the book, but could not stop reading it either. I was left elated as well as sad. There was just something keeping me yearning for more and more, although I constantly wanted to turn my back on it as well! And if I think back, I realized that nobody was a villain or a hero. They were all just depressingly human, like you and me. Skillfully written. Masterful prose. Certainly one of the better reads this year. I am glad I bought it. But I did close it with mix feelings reigning me in. I need to consider why."

What I loved: • The story. • The title that indicates not just the painting in the story but also works as a metaphor for the lead character Theo, who seems to be stuck in place no matter how much he tries to fly. It works brilliantly for the story. • The emotions of the various lead characters who are so flawed and yet you can’t help connecting with them. Hobie was my favourite of the lot, but even Theo, with all his murky greys and Boris with his screwed-up Russian loyalties make a mark. (Making a mark doesn’t necessarily mean you will like them.) • The writing quality, except for the length of the scenes, was excellent. The author’s use of analogies and character musings worked very well. It’s a character-driven novel from start to end. • All the references to art. In my real life, I can’t make head or tail of paintings but I enjoyed reading the thoughts related to all things artistic in this book. • The looooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggg scenes. The Bombayite in me kept complaining “” () At least 200 pages could have been docked off the final tally if the author were focussed more on completing what she set out to do than establishing literary merit. • Too much of philosophising, which adds to the dragged feel. • 32 hours on audio. Oh my dear God! I could have read 3 audiobooks in this time. If I had read this a decade ago, when I was younger and had more time & patience to deal with a 700 pager, I might have rated it 4 stars. But at this stage, I can rate it a 3.5 at best. No regrets reading it, but I’m relieved it’s done and dusted. No FOMO. And no reread on my agenda for this book. *********************** Join me on the Facebook group, , for more reviews, book-related discussions and fun."

Bless Donna Tartt for undertaking a true modern epic, one that evokes Dickens (which has gotten all the attention) but even moreso, structurally and in theme and scope, Proust. Proust is so all over this novel that it was a relief when she finally mentioned him; the book is structured like a symphony in the same way ""In Search of Lost Time"" is. I applaud her scope and detail; the ten years she took to write it show. Still, there are long passages that drag, are overwritten, overly long. But the end of this book is so satisfying and beautiful it makes the journey worth it. Her prose is neither as elegant as Proust's nor as brisk as Dickens and that makes it a tough read. But the heart of the story -- the painting and the meditations on art -- is beautiful and ultimately make the sometimes uphill climb all worth it at the end. Do I wish she had written this book differently? Very much. But the book she has written is so unique and delicate of sensibility, and so respectful and loving of art itself that I love it flaws and all."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A truly marvellous book - engaging from the start, and as dark, twisted and emotionally challenging as all Donna Tartt's novels. It's very long, and some might think too long - filled with details and vignettes that seen not to contribute to the plot - but reading a book like this for the plot is mostly counter-intuitive. You read this novel, if you read it, for the whole tapestry, messy and gorgeous as it is, and its length, and the time it takes to tell, are a necessary part of the whole. There are a couple of details I jibbed at - a killer plot device near the end; a few too many co-incidences - but those things are minor details in a work of incredible richness and fluidity. The last few pages contain not only the most gorgeous passages of writing I've come across in ages, but delivers in a few pages the thematical heart of the whole book - a whammy as powerful in its way as the last page of ""Wuthering Heights"", and as redemptive. Not everyone will enjoy this one - don't look for characters to aspire to, or uplifting moral messages in here - but as an insight into the nature of bereavement, guilt, yearning and the sublime transience of beauty, this has got to be one of the greats."

There are so many vividly portrayed characters: young Theo Decker (who is telling the story), Pippa, Mrs. Barbour, Kitsey, and Hobie. And my favorite, the amazing Boris, sort of an Eastern European Artful Dodger who alone is reason enough to read this long Dickensian novel. I would give this wonderful book 10 stars if I could!"
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What I like most about Tartt is her love of detail. Clothes, furniture, light, cheekbones—she describes her fictional world more clearly than I see my real one. Her pacing is desultory, to put it mildly, but she's capable of writing scenes so gripping and suspenseful that they're hard to get through (that part when Theo's on the phone with his lawyer, and his dad's listening on the extension! It's SO GOOD!). The Goldfinch reminds me of The Art of Fielding, in that it's almost completely disconnected from the real world; both novels read like fairy tales. Tartt acknowledges the existence of smart phones and Facebook, but all of her characters, including teenage American boys, talk like they just stepped out of Dickens (""We're in a bit of a tip,"" ""What shall I do?"" ""I'm all out of sorts""), and her depiction of Manhattan is so rosy and strange it reminded me of From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. If you loved the preppiness and privilege of The Secret History, you'll be happy to encounter reams of boat shoes, antiques, and brittle blondes here. If you have no patience for that world, you might like the swath of the novel set in sun-scorched, trashy Vegas. If you enjoyed the menace of TSH, you'll be pleased with the deaths that pile up in these pages. If you found TSH callow in its treatment of murder, you'll be happy to find that Tartt has grown more comfortable with real emotion."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I can’t get no sat-is-fac-tion, and I tried! I tried! Oh how I tried! Nothing's working for me this week: It started with The Element of Fire, followed quickly by , , then a genre switch to , , Return, by Peter S. Beagle, and now The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. Only pages into a few (Leonard, Hopkinson), a few I’ve read over half (Allison, Beagle) but almost all I intend to finish. But I’m considering throwing in the DNF pile. You know me–I don’t often give up on a book. Right time, right place and all that. But despite waiting forever for a library copy, I just don’t care. I picked up just a day ago, trying to wipe the residue of a nasty meeting away. At 1%, I have a significant portion of writing of “The Consultant” outlined, writing that is playful, erudite, and cleverly self-aware. I mention this because Tartt's much-glorified writing was painful in comparison. Full of colons and semi-colons as if it was impossible to finish a thought. By all accounts, I ought to love Elaborate passages, vivid descriptions of New York–-and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of my favorite places in the world–-and loads of character depth. I still don’t care. It feels pretentious and preening, self-aware in that extravagantly dismissive way New Yorkers can have, that “look-at-me” image that dismisses you as soon as you look. And Theo, the lead character… I’m not warming up to him. Self-absorbed, noticeably lacking in empathy, he is the epitome of thirteen. Of course, Tartt could take him places, so I’ll keep reading. But I’m finding him hard to like, and with many Issues that seem self-generated, I really don’t care. Pity party of one, please–I’ll be leaving now. I might be able to forgive the writing, since I do love a well-turned image, and possibly I could come to be interested in Theo, but I’ve just reached the scene of the explosion and Theo’s reaction, which seems so consciously contrived and artificial that the writing shouts Detailed Over-Explanation for Meaningful Stuff that Will Be Important Later. I’m not saying I mind obvious, or contrived, but in this case, it starts to feel like three strikes: unlikeable narrator, pretentious writing, forced plotting. I’m going to thank the library for giving me an out. ************************ The Goldfinch, part deux: Tackling in larger chunks is working, spurred on partly by the library. Theo remains somewhat unlikeable, although I certainly have compassion. Still, I'm hearing strange echoes of , which makes absolutely no sense. The first 200 pages are NYC and it is just about like a Dutch painting. Feel like I'm there, but it is dark and gloomy. Extremely realistic, but the subject matter is barely interesting."
The Goldfinch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have thought long and hard about this book and what I could possibly say about it that could even remotely do it justice. I finished this book weeks ago and I still find myself reflecting back on it. A true piece of literature like The Goldfinch will leave you in contemplation. I can honestly say it is one of the best books I have ever read in my life and put it in the ranks of . Donna Tartt has created a masterpiece here. I cannot stress that enough. This book is both thought provoking and profound. There is a truth in her writing that spoke to me in ways other books can’t. I will admit it was extremely difficult for me to read at times because the main character loses a parent and I lost my father a mere two weeks before picking this book up. I had to put the book down several times to let the tears pass before I was able to pick it up again. I felt that someone truly knew how I felt and understood my grief in a way that no one else did. Yet another sign of a great writer is writing with emotional accuracy. Tartt’s prose is a form of art all in itself. You can tell that she carefully placed each word and took her time writing this novel. It is a long book- 771 pages- but every word serves its purpose and made this book the masterpiece that it is. The characters are unforgettable and you will reflect on them often with a fondness that is unexplainable to those who do not cherish books. The storyline is heartbreaking and yes, at times, depressing beyond belief. Theo’s life is an ongoing tragedy and the content is heavy to say the least, but there seems to be an underlying glimmer of hope that shines through ever so faintly. One thing that stood out to me the most throughout this book is how the memories are portrayed. In a lot of books you get these crystal clear images of how things used to be. With this book, Theo’s recollections are hazy from drug and alcohol abuse and fogged over with the passage of time. The memories are how we remember things- where you can’t really recall what you were thinking when you did something, just that you know at the time it felt right. The actual painting- the Goldfinch- becomes a metaphor throughout the book’s entirety. I can’t get over how intricate this story really was. You understood certain aspects at different moments and then there is a huge revelation that blows the whole storyline wide open that allows you to see the whole picture. You think you know right along while you are reading, but you truly have no idea until that moment just how careful Tartt was with weaving this story. I remember lying in bed reading at well past midnight, unable to put the book down, and upon reading the aforementioned revelation, sitting straight up in bed, throwing my hand over my mouth and silently saying “oh no, oh no, oh no!”. I sat there for several minutes, rereading it over and over again, silently admiring Tartt’s deft prose. I have seen a lot of negative reviews for this book, and I personally can’t understand them. I think this is truly one of the best books of our time and one that will stand the test of time. Perhaps if you have never had tragedy strike, or had a bout of depression in your life, you won’t see the beauty in this book. Having watched my father take his last breath, and lived with depression for years while he battled cancer, I understood this book on a much deeper level. I urge people to pick this book up. It is an instant classic in my opinion and will be talked about for years to come. The Goldfinch is truly one of a kind and will impact you in ways you never knew possible. I cannot even begin to do it the justice it deserves. A solid 5 star rating. I look forward to reading more of Tartt’s works."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was terribly interesting, but I think you needed to know a little more than Sontag explained to understand where she is coming from in all this. The important thing to remember is that Plato wanted to banish the artists and he wanted to do this for a very good reason. To Plato the world we live in isn’t really the real world – the real world is a world we cannot have access to, the real world is where things never die, things remain the same and don’t change. Change and death, to Plato, are proof that the world we live in isn’t the real world. So, Plato saw the world we live in as a world of shadows, that is, one step away from reality. Art was therefore two steps away from reality and was therefore a copy of a copy. For Plato what we needed to do was get closer to reality, not further away from it. Therefore, he needed to banish artists from his ideal society as they move us away from reality towards images - that is more shadows. So, for as long as we have had idealist philosophy we have had a problem between images, reality and how we can go about understanding the differences between the one and the other. This might sound like quite a trivial problem, but it is actually incredibly important. As Margaret Wertheim shows in her , how we have understood space has fundamentally changed how we have understood reality. Prior to the Renaissance space in artworks was depicted not to represent an ‘accurate’ picture of what people saw – but rather to show relative importance. So, God is huge and the angels are somewhat smaller and the king is smaller still, and the rest of us are tiny. The Renaissance developed perspective painting and with it helped to create the revolution in science that required a revolution in how we saw space, not as a frame for morality to be played out within, but as a plane for the unraveling of amoral and disinterested forces. As Sontag says in this work, “But the notions of image and reality are complementary. When the notion of reality changes, so does that of the image, and vice versa. “ Page 125 In many ways Sontag wants to turn Plato on his head. Plato would have had serious problems with photography. His main problem would have been the seeming accuracy of photographs. As Sontag says, “Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we’re shown a photograph of it.” Page 3 Or perhaps more importantly, “Photography is the reality; the real object is often experienced as a letdown. Photographs make normative an experience of art that is mediated, second-hand, intense in a different way.” Page 115 She plays with this idea of photographs being more real than reality throughout the book. Hard to put this point more pointedly than when she says, “Ultimately, having an experience becomes identical with taking a photograph of it, and participating in public event comes more and more to be equivalent to looking at it in photographed form.” Page 18 And breathtakingly, ""It is common for people to insist about their experience of a violent event in which they were caught up—a plane crash, a shoot-out, a terrorist bombing—that 'it seemed like a movie.'” Page 126 Photography gets to be ‘evidence’ because, “In the fairy tale of photography the magic box insures varacity and banishes error, compensates for inexperience and rewards innocence.” Page 41 The problem is that not only can photographs lie – something we still struggle to believe – but they lie on every level. They lie because they are a selective choice of what reality we intent to show. They lie because most photographs are anything but what people think they are – an accurate representation of what is photographed. This point needs a bit of explaining. Think about what happens to you when someone holds a camera up towards you. It is nearly impossible not to pose. But that means that what you get a photograph of isn’t really ‘you’, but instead an image of you posing in front of a camera. As she points out, “That photographs are often praised for their candour, their honesty, indicates that most photographs, of course, are not candid.” Page 66 We like to think that photographs explain the world to us and help us to understand it, but again she is savage in debunking this idea. “Photography implies that we know about the world if we accept it as the camera records it. But this is the opposite of understanding, which starts from not accepting the world as it looks.” Page 17 To really understand the world involves seeing the world as a process, in action, in time. But a camera – a still camera at least – cannot capture the process of life. The problem is that to understand a thing means, “understanding … how it functions. And functioning takes place in time, and must be explained in time. Only that which narrates can make us understand.” Page 18 However, the veracity of images gives them an authenticity that confuses and bewilders us. And this is where the caption comes in. We look at the image and we see time frozen. We see a captured instant in what, to be understood, needs to be a continuum. The ‘context’ to understand this instant is added often by words, by language, by a caption. The relationship is a difficult one, but one that needs to be acknowledged: “’This photograph, like any photograph,’ Godard and Gorin point out, ‘is physically mute. It talks through the mouth of the text written beneath it.’ In fact, words do speak louder than pictures. Captions do tend to override the evidence of our eyes; but no caption can permanently restrict or secure a picture’s meaning.” Page 84 And this brings us to what I think is the main point – and back to Plato again. For Plato ‘the truth’ is what we need to spend a lifetime seeking, even if we are sure of only one thing – that we will never find that truth. The Greek word for truth is . It means to uncover, unconceal. While Plato is seeking to get us to turn away from reality to see the reality beyond the apparent, photography also gets us to turn away from the real world, but as a way to get us to see the real world that is hidden in plane sight. Sontag again, “All that photography’s program of realism actually implies is the belief that reality is hidden. And, being hidden, is something to be unveiled.” Page 94 A lot of this book concerns the relationship between painting and photography. Painting is clearly an art form – and not just for the snobbish reason that it has a history going back as far as people go back, but also because to paint is to interpret. To paint is to put something of yourself into a painting. But it is very hard for a photographer to be truly original in the way painters can be. And this makes sense of something she points out about paintings and photographs, “It makes sense that a painting is signed but a photograph is not (or seems bad taste if it is). “ Page 104 But also that, “there is no internal evidence for identifying as the work of a single photographer…” Page 105 Painting is also a high-art form. She makes the point that art is hard work, “Classical modernist painting presupposes highly developed skills of looking, and a familiarity with other art and with certain notions about art history. “ Page 102 But photography presents itself as realism – realism in the sense that all you need are a pair of eyes to understand what is being shown to you. Of course, this is anything but the case, but we will get to that in a second. Photography isn’t so much interested in the beautiful, she says at one point, “In photography’s early decades, photographs were expected to be idealised images. This is still the aim of most amateur photographers, for whom a beautiful photograph is a photograph of something beautiful, like a woman, a sunset.” Page 22 Rather photography makes the mundane and even the ugly ‘beautiful’ – beautiful in the sense that the very act of photographing it gives it an interest and fascination. Worse than this, not only have photographs turned everything into the potentially beautiful, but by presenting so many objects before us as objects of erotic or voyeuristic pleasure (I mean this in the broadest possible sense) photography is guilty of dulling our senses to the truly horrible. “Much of modern art is devoted to lowering the threshold of what is terrible.” Page 32 But even this is only partly true. Sometimes the opposite is also the case. At one point she describes going to see an operation performed in a Chinese hospital – she observed this and although it sounds gruesome in all the ways we expect operations to be, she was able to watch the whole thing with more fascination than revulsion. But, amusingly enough, she wasn’t able watch a film made of nearly exactly the same thing. She explains this by saying, “One is vulnerable to disturbing events in the form of photographic images in a way that one is not to the real thing. That vulnerability is part of the distinctive passivity of someone who is a spectator twice over, spectator of events already shaped, first by the participants and second by the image maker.” Page 132 The ideological role photography plays in a particular society depends on the nature of the guiding ideology of that society. She makes wonderful use of a few stories from China about what makes a good photograph. She discusses a series of photographs taken by a Western photographer that the Chinese protested against. These showed rather candid photographs of the Chinese going about their daily lives. The Chinese critic found that idea repulsive about the photographs. The people photographed had been violated because they had not been given the opportunity to present themselves to the camera. Also, the images focused on parts of objects and of people. This too was seen by the Chinese as disrespectful. The images the Chinese government approved of were more likely to be of the ‘Unknown Citizen Lei Feng – someone too good to be true and therefore worthy of emulation. As Sontag says, “In China, what makes an image true is that it is good for people to see it.” Page 137 That is, not the images literal truth – which everyone probably knows is almost certainly staged - but rather the truth as it ‘ought’ to be. Yet again, another hidden truth. But if she is savage about Communist propaganda photography, she is hardly soft on Capitalist propaganda photography either. “A capitalist society requires a culture based on images. It needs to furnish vast amounts of entertainment in order to stimulate buying and anesthetize the injuries of class, race, and sex. And it needs to gather unlimited amounts of information, the better to exploit natural resources, increase productivity, keep order, make war, give jobs to bureaucrats. The camera’s twin capacities, to subjectivize reality and to objectify it, ideally serve these needs and strengthen them. Cameras define reality in the two ways essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers). The production of images also furnishes a ruling ideology. Social change is replaced by a change in images. The freedom to consume a plurality of images and goods is equated with freedom itself. The narrowing of free political choice to free economic consumptions requires the unlimited production and consumption of images.” Page 140 I am going to end with something – as someone who was born in Belfast – I found utterly fascinating. It is a quote she has at the end of the book – the last chapter is actually just a series of interesting quotes from famous people and ads about the nature of photography. The best of these is a quote from Kafka. But this quote from the literally stopped me: “The people of Belfast are buying picture postcards of their city’s torment by the hundreds. The most popular shows a boy throwing a stone at a British armored car.” Page 156 (from New York Times 29 Oct 1974) I said before that Sontag doesn’t believe we can use photographs to understand – that photographs show the apparent, and to understand means to go beyond the appearance. But I think this quote on Belfast shows that photographs can help us to reach some kind of understanding. The people of Belfast in 1974 (with nearly 30 years of the Troubles ahead of them) were confronted by something that must have seemed completely alien to them – civil war in the streets of their home town. That is, they would have been confronted daily with the bizarre, surreal, unreality of what was a new reality forever ready to assert its own all-too-real-ness. How does one come to terms with this new ‘reality’? Photographs helped them to make sense of such a surreal world. “Neil Shawcross, a Belfast man, bought two complete sets of the cards, explaining, ‘I think they’re interesting mementoes of the times and I want my children to have them when they grow up.’” Little did he know his children would have far more mementoes of those times in their own growing up. This is a fascinating book and rightly a classic on photography."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I found this book utterly maddening. I'm giving it four stars not for the content itself, but for the quality of thinking I did while reading. I'm rather surprised not to have found any comments in other reviews regarding Sontag's horrific tactlessness in her discussions of ""freaks"" (in the context of Diane Arbus' work). Less shocking but also disappointing: her wholesale dismissal of the Surrealists, or as she calls them two or three times, the Surrealist ""militants"", which they decidedly were not. Overall, I found the writing -- while at times illuminating -- overwhelmingly and groundlessly judgmental. Sontag's logic is often very, very dubious; she is as dangerous as Camus (I'm thinking of Le mythe de Sisyphe) when it comes to the seductiveness of fine, well-articulated prose which uses its own music to trick the reader into believing the message. Beware."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Susan Sontag’s On Photography left me horrified at the idea of photography and put me off using my camera ever again. And yet, I find it outstanding. To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. Just as the camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a sublimated murder - a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time. is a set of essays on , society, history, politics, our relationship with the idea of the image and the potential “truth” revealed in a photograph. Sontag does not praise photography, nor does she condemn it. With a critical eye, she manages to reveal it in a completely new light. Although some of her revelations may not be new or surprising in this day and age, there are many brilliant and thought-provoking ideas. What is the nature of photography? Is it art? What does it mean to take a photograph? What is the influence of the image on society? I believe this is not the best book on the history of photography let alone aesthetics of photography, yet Sontag looks back on the work of many photographers and the evolution of photography itself. Sontag reflects on the potentials and dangers of photography. Even in the 70s when this book was written, both the individual and society were already getting used to the idea of a photograph as a true image of reality, they found themselves living in a world of images. I wonder what Sontag would say about our own photo obsessed, social-media saturated world. Some of the ideas in resonated with other ideas in the books I was reading at the same time, which made this whole reading experience even more precious. Even though I would disagree with some of Sontag’s ideas, the author challenged my own idea of photography, its relationship with art, society and humanity. I wish she were here to write a set of essays . Fascinating work. My first film camera."

It's hailed as ""one of the most highly regarded books of its kind"". I like taking photographs myself, and thought I would find it interesting. Those seeking a well-constructed history of photography, its development and an introduction to various schools and movements of photography - as I did - are likely to be disappointed. has no central thesis, and is a collection of essays ""about the meaning and career of photographs"" as described by Sontag herself. This isn't a book on photography - it's a book on Susan Sontag. Although she writes about a wealth of photographers, Sontag doesn't explore any of them in depth - she moves from one to another very quickly, and often they are reduced to backgrounds for her own thoughts and opinions on photographs, which often include comparisons and references to other media. This can make for some very dense reading - I thought that the book suffered painfully from a lack of a central thesis. My biggest gripe with the book is that while by nature it has to be a polemic - it contains no bibliography or citations - Sontag constantly makes sweeping generalizations about both photography and photographers without offering any explanation. She presents her opinions as if they were facts, entirely without nuance, leaving no room for disagreement. To give her credit she has a multitude of opinions, and to praise or dismiss them all completely out of hand would be unfair, but many of her claims are very dubious: such as stating that tourists who enjoy taking snapshots of what they see do it because they know no other response, and for some it's the only way to appease their anxiety about not working (citation needed, unless we're going to stereotype whole nations). There are other claims that Sontag makes, which do real harm to all the otherwise good ideas she might have presented as they howl at us straight from loon territory. Although Sontag writes that , there is nonetheless , as it may - all from a distance. And are you thinking dirty thoughts when you see a long-focus lens? Apparently you're not alone, and you're not even aware that you're doing it: (We all know that phalluses shoot, but how does one load a phallus?) I don't know about others, but I never had a fantasy of having a gun or knife between my legs - I like what's there just fine the way it is! But it gets worse: Melodramatic writing like this strikes me as beyond silly; the idea that people might not only consent to be photographed but to have their photograph taken and actively seek that opportunity is never considered. While it's a good paragraph from a literary perspective - cameras become guns, people are possessed by celluloid voodoo, and taking their photos is just a slightly better way of murdering them - it's the kind of writing that George Orwell famously described as being designed to . All these essays have been written in the 1970's, long before the advent of both the internet and digital photography - which has transformed the medium completely, as it's now surrounding us completely, included in everything that we do. What would Susan Sontag say about people chuckling at funny cat pictures? I'm afraid the thought didn't even cross her mind. The malicious motives that Susan Sontag gives to all photographers have been largely replaced with people sharing the joy of taking photographs with others: people take photographs of themselves and share them with each other, connecting in ways which were previously impossible. I've read that Susan Sontag later turned back from some of the views that she held while writing - it's a shame this self-dissent was not included."

It was the first book I read about photography, which is not technical. I remember something profoundly complex, which helped me better penetrate this image's world even if the subject was not treated only under its artistic side. Good memories."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The above six essays simply make up of the most highly regarded and thoroughly interesting books of its kind. I'm a big fan of Roland Barthes's 'Camera Lucida' (although about photography it's more a personal book dealing with the loss of his mother) and this was equally as good if not better. Sontag raises important and exciting questions about photography and raises them in the most readable and thought-provoking way. I always have fears when approaching essays, like will they turn into a bore-feast or feel like a homework assignment, but no, there was never a dull moment, Sontag didn't make me feel like nodding off. Photography, unlike painting, does not only address and represent its object and does not only resemble it; it is also a part of the object, its direct extension. Photography, according to Sontag, is a form of acquisition in a number of ways. When you photograph something, it becomes a part of certain knowledge system, adapted to schemas of classification and storage starting from family photographs up to police, political and scientific usage. Photography, in other words, is a form of supervision. Throughout time reality has been related through countless images, and philosophers such as Plato have made efforts to diminish our reliance on representations by pointing at a direct way to grasp the real. Sontag quotes Feuerbach in saying that our age prefers the photograph to the real thing, the appearance before the experience. This argument, she points out, is widely accepted in modern culture which is constantly engaged with producing and consuming images to such a degree that photography has been made essential for the health of the economy and the stability of social structures. Photography, holds an almost unlimited authority in modern society. Such photographic images are capable of replacing reality by virtue of being not only a mirror or interpretation of in, but also a relic of reality, something that is taken straight from it. We seem to consume photographs at an ever increasing rate and they are therefore consumed and simply need to be replaced. Meaning, the more we take photographs the more we need to take photographs, and this accounts for what is known today as the pictorial turn. I could rabble on for ages on this book, but will just say it's simply a brilliant and groundbreaking analysis of the profound changes photographic images have made in our way of looking at the world and at ourselves. I doubt I will read a better piece of writing on the subject."

Outrageous, scandalous, sexy and with a great degree of truth. We're all image junkies, living in an age where we try to mark our development through a series of photographs that we hope will speak for us, instead of us. Sontag writes that to photograph is to appropriate the photographed. And it's not just objects that are photographed, we photograph poverty, misery, pain, death - so we appropriate emotions too- to what purpose? To use the photograph as a signifier? What is it in us that makes us covet this sort of obscure, dismal immortality? The act of photographing demands that the instance being photographed remain static, and therefore, Sontag argues that photography has a vested interest in the status quo remaining unchanged. This is particularly amusing to me because the multitudes of photographs on social media fashioned after a common, 'trendy' theme and marketed using tags which, to me, is very reminiscent of dead butterflies being pinned onto boards, all seem different iterations of the same prototype. We are not just asking for immortality, we are asking that 'this moment' remain immortal (and it's a particularly crappy moment if you ask me.) That it be preserved within the dynamics of time relentlessly moving forward, but to what avail? Who's going to unearth all these images? These digital mass graves? A society that is ruled by class, race and sex based discriminations needs an anaesthetic, and the legion of images provide us with more data than we could consume in ten different lifetimes. The elite keep their control while we keep our illusions and it's a win-win y'all. I realise this has been more of a pessimistic rant than a review, but it's sunday and I want to sleep. So meh."

Sontag develops further the concept of 'transparency'. When anything can be photographed and photography has destroyed the boundaries and definitions of art, a viewer can approach a photograph freely with no expectations of discovering what it means. This collection of six lucid and invigorating essays, the most famous being ""In Plato's Cave"", make up a deep exploration of how the image has affected society. تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز پنجم ماه می سال 2012میلادی عنوان: دربارۀ عکاسی؛ نویسنده سوزان سونتاگ؛ با گفتاری از جان برجر؛ مترجم نگين شيدوش؛ ویرایش متن و گزینش تصاویر فرشید آذرنگ؛ تهران، حرفه نویسنده، چاپ اول و دوم 1389، 1390؛ در 400ص، مصور؛ چاپ سوم 1392؛ چاپ چهارم، 1393؛ چاپ پنجم 1394، در 416ص، مصور؛ شابک 9786009197729؛ چاپ دیگر 1396؛ در 381ص؛ مصور؛ موضوع عکاسی هنری از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20م عنوان: درباره ی عکاسی؛ نویسنده سوزان سانتاگ؛ مترجم مجید اخگر؛ تهران، چاپ و نشر نظر، حرفه هنرمند، 1390؛ در 240ص، مصور؛ شابک 9786001520617؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، بیدگل؛ 1397؛ در 296ص؛ شابک 9786007806791؛ عنوان: درباره عکاسی؛ نویسنده سوزان سونتاگ؛ مترجم: فرزانه طاهری؛ ویرایش مینا سی‌سی، احسان مجیدی‌تیرداد؛ به سفارش انجمن سینمای جوانان ایران؛ تهران، کتاب آبان، چاپ دوم 1397؛ شابک 9786007343913؛ عنوان: درباره عکاسی: مجموعه جستارها، نقدها و یادداشت‌ها والتر بنیامین؛‌ با جستاری از پل والری؛ موخره‌ ای از سوزان سونتاگ؛ ویراستار استر لسلی؛ ترجمه آیدین رحیمی‌پورآزاد؛ تهران: حرفه نویسنده‫، 1398؛ در 375ص؛ شابک 978600229؛ فهرست برگردان خانم «نگین شیدوش»؛ «یادداشت نویسنده، ص 15»؛ «در غار افلاطون، ص 17»؛ «آمریکای تیره و تار در عکس ها، ص 59»؛ «اشیای مالیخولیایی، ص 109»؛ «قهرمانی در دیدن، ص 183»؛ «انجیل های عکاسی، ص 247»؛ «جهان تصویر، ص 311»؛ گزیده مختصر نقل قولها، ص 359»؛ «کاربرد عکاسی، جان برجر، ص 395»؛ نقل از مقدمه «سوزان سانتگ ماه می سال 1977میلادی»: (همه چیز با یک مقاله شروع شد؛ مقاله ای در باب برخی مسائل اخلاقی، و زیبایی شناختی ای، که به سبب حضور همیشگی عکاسها، بوجود آمده بودند؛ اما رفته رفته، هرچه بیشتر به عکسها اندیشیدم، آنها هم در نظرم پیچیده تر، و معنادار شدند؛ همین شد که یک مقاله، به مقاله ای دیگر انجامید؛ و آنهم در کمال تعجب به یکی دیگر؛ و الی آخر)؛ پایان نقل تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 15/02/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Despite the academic language, the work is gripping due to the relevance of its ideas. Sontag sees photography not just as art, but as a powerful tool for perceiving the world. She argues that photography shapes our understanding of reality by turning it into static images, often devaluing the essence of phenomena. Her critical approach makes the text relevant today, in the era of digital visual culture, when images dominate everyday life through social networks and media. The book invites reflection on how photographs not only document but also change our perception of history, events, and one another. As a professional photojournalist, I was particularly interested in seeing how Susan Sontag dissects the process of photography itself. She views photography not only as a technical tool, but as a powerful means of interpreting and influencing perceptions of reality."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The collection of essays ""About Photography"" is one of the most famous works of Susan Sontag, it seems that talking about her today, first of all they remember this thing. Not by chance, considering how widely photography has entered the current everyday life. The desire to understand what motivates us to commit certain actions, to indulge in a certain passion, the desire to bring a philosophical basis for this is natural, and nowadays photographing is one of the most common actions and the most accessible in the satisfaction of passions. And I haven't said this yet about the possibility of creative self-expression, which is priceless. Сьюзен Зонтаг (возможен вариант произношения ""Сонтаг"") писательница, философ, сценарист и режиссер театра и кино, литературный и художественный критик, икона мирового феминистского движения. И говоря о феминизме, я имею в виду не только борьбу за права женщин, в сфере интересов Зонтаг были представители меньшинств и социально-угнетенных групп, изменение отношения с стигматизированным темам, как СПИД, например. Расцвета ее карьера романиста достигла с присуждением Национально книжной премии за роман ""В Америке"". Сборник эссе ""О фотографии"" одна из самых известных работ писательницы, кажется, говоря о ней сегодня, в первую очередь вспоминают эту вещь. Не случайно, учитывая, насколько широко фотография вошла в нынешнюю повседневность. Желание понимать, что движет нами, совершающими те или иные действия, предающимся некой страсти, стремление подвести под это философскую базу естественно, а в наши дни фотографирование одно из самых распространенных действий и самая доступная в удовлетворении из страстей. И это я еще не сказала о возможности творческого самовыражения, которая бесценна. В сборник входят шесть эссе и ""Краткая антология цитат"" - высказывания известных людей, посвященные фотографии, как виду искусства и способу взаимодействия с миром. Первый текст ""В Платоновой пещере"" отсылает к образу реальности, данной в ощущениях, как скольжению теней по стене, которые видят прикованные в пещере спиной ко входу люди. Мы по-прежнему не можем видеть мир таким, каков он в реальности, но существование фотографии меняет ракурс, чуть расширяя его. Фотографируя, мы отчасти присваиваем мир. ""Америка в фотографиях Сквозь тусклое стекло"", вторая статья посвящена работам Дианы Арбус - известного фотографа и значительной фигуры культурного бэкграунда второй-третьей четвертей ХХ века. Написанное под впечатлением от ретроспективной выставки Арбус вскоре после ее смерти, оно далеко от безудержного восхваления по принципу ""хорошо или ничего"". Скорее Зонтаг относится к работам своей героини критически. Дело в том, что центральным мотивом в творчестве Арбус были маргиналы, фрики разного рода и обычные люди в естественной для себя обстановке, которые подавались с такого ракурса, что выглядели скорее пародией на себя самих. Говоря о ее работах, Зонтаг приходит к выводу, что стремление любой ценой отыскать красоту в уродстве достаточно безнадежно. а эстетическое вступает на территорию этического с не самым лучшим для себя результатом. ""Меланхолические объекты"" посвящена сюрреалистичности природы фотографии, ее сиюминутности, с течением времени изменяющей, порой радикально, возможные трактовки. Так постановочные фотографии, призванные играть роль манифеста некоего художественного направления, оказываются слепком эпохи, а детские фото известных людей, сделанные всего лишь с целью запечатлеть милых деток, смотрятся совсем иначе, когда знаешь, стал этот карапуз Сталиным или Пресли. ""Героизм видения"". Увидеть и запечатлеть красоту - как основной посыл фотографии. В отличие от живописи, с которой ее часто соотносят, фотографическое видение не создает целостную картину мира, но напротив, дробит его на фрагменты. Порой съемка изменяет восприятие, делая эротичные объекты бесполыми и придавая сексуальную притягательность вещам изначально далеким от эротического контекста. ""Фотографические евангелия"" О том, как фотография побуждает своих деятелей снова и снова объяснять миру ценность того, чем они занимаются, подводя теоретическую базу. Претензия на знание, претензия на творчество, представление о фотографе, как об идеальном наблюдателе и одновременная невозможность достичь желаемого эффекта без вмешательства, без некоторого элемента постановочности, которая автоматически выводит фотографа из статуса наблюдателя на роль участника и режиссера. Все же: фиксировать или режессировать? ""Мир изображений"" от Платона до Фейербаха, философия считала изображение отличным от реальности. Однако фотография, в силу некоей присущей ей магии, не только точно фиксирует кусочек мира и позволяет присвоить его, но и становится в какой-то мере средством управления реальности, изменения ее. Резюмируя: замечательно интересный, содержательный и при этом читабельный сборник эссе в превосходном переводе Виктора Голышева, патриарха отечественного литературного перевода."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Susan Sontag starts her book on photography with a reference to Plato's cave, a dark prison only a few escape. This is not accidental. It defines and presages the thinking that underlies the whole book. By placing a reference to Plato at the very beginning Sontag is telling us: 'I subscribe to the fundamental Platonic principles: the real world vs. the world of imitations. Forms vs. art. Reality vs. the cave.' Or something like that. So what does this entail for her analysis of photography? Sontag is angry at photography. She's angry because photography lacks the means (or so she thinks) to distinguish between truth and falsity, compassion and detached observation. Instead, photography allies itself either with the early, optimistic humanism of, say, Walt Whitman (every person is the same, everyone is equal with everyone else, everyone deserves as much to be photographed as everyone else) or with the later humanism of Andy Warhol (again, everyone is the same, everyone is equal with everyone else, no subject has more of a right to be photographed than anyone else). Why is this a problem, we might ask? Sontag does not spell this out very clearly, but her analysis points to a failure on the part of photography to make itself an instrument of politics and history. Sontag regrets the fact that by photographing each and every subject without concern for the context photography abstracts from the historical specificity that gives meaning to that subject. She also laments photography's failute to be politically engaged. But what about those photographs that have shaped the public's perception of humanitarian wars and disasters, you might ask? What about the photograph of the naked, napalmed Vietnamese girl that had an impact on American public opnion about the Vietnam war? Sontag replies that it's not the photographs themselves that alter public perceptions but an ideological framework that predates these photographs and allows them to have an impact. She may be right in this. But doesn't this apply equally to any other endeavour to bring atrocities to public attention? Isn't journalism or activism subject to the same vicissitudes? Here's where Sontag's Platonism kicks in; photography fails because it cannot bring about a political moment of truth that disperses the fantasies of the cave and forces the cave prisoners out into the open where they will be confronted by reality. It fails because it cannot bring about understanding. But if photography can't, then what can? Political analysis? Speeches? Activism? Necessary as these are in their own right, they are as tied to the overarching framework as photography is (although an analysis committed to understanding, as Sontag's is, would like to think not). Edit: I wasn't able to read this again properly for the second time, as I intended, but I gave the book an additional star because it has, after all, shaped greatly the philosophical understanding of photography. I'm still not convinced by Sontag and plan a more sustained study of this book in conjunction with other texts, Derrida's , and Benjamin's ."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I approached On Photography expecting a sense of warmth and intellect that Maria Popova paints Susan Sontag with. One essay in, I was slightly disappointed to feel no warmth. So, I read an interview of hers where the interviewer says the ""yes and no"" attitude is typical of her writing, something that I had experienced as well. She responds by saying that it is not yes and no, rather this but also that. She argues in defence of the premise of seriousness, an idea both close to my heart and valuable for the essays in this volume. Seriousness does not mean the heaviness equates it to, rather slow, deliberate rigour. A quality present in all the essays as she entertains many aspects of photography for the benefit of the reader. Sontag looks at photography from the perspective of the photo, the photographer and the viewer. She discusses how photography has changed the equation of an individual's association with the rest of the world in her essay, . Photographs fiddle with the scale that one is trained to see the world, and the notion of time that we have collectively accepted. An intriguing idea is that photography can only reinforce a moral position, not create one. This was one of the many ideas I hadn't thought about before, ideas that seemed to hold ground but I would have liked to discuss them. This is a really good book to read as a group. I went through my notes and reread several parts of the collection after reading a review that chastised Sontag for her content, because it was very much unlike my reading. I'd noticed Sontag's euphemism free critique of Diane Arbus, yet I did not consider her derogatory. This is a contentious debate that will probably give rise to a lot of presentism sins, so I won't discuss that. On Diane Arbus' work, I'm not convinced she didn't approve of it. In she evokes Walt Whitman's notion that beauty and ugliness being immaterial in an inclusive embrace of the real. Arbus's wikipedia page suggests that . I checked the citations for it, a published after Sontag's death. I haven't read the paper but from my reading of this work, Sontag simply stated that Arbus' work wasn't meant to stir compassion. I agree with her and I love Arbus' work. For a person who hates taking pictures and having my picture taken, I really love Arbus for the same reason. Another says she notes with bemusement of Arbus' subjects who are “pathetic, pitiable, as well as repulsive” look “cheerful, self-accepting, matter-of-fact.” She wondered, “Do they know how grotesque they are? It seems as if they don’t.” They “appear not to know that they are ugly.” Looking at how the author has cherry picked the statements. it looks like either a deliberate case of misconstruing what an author meant to say or not even trying to understand*. Sontag quotes Nietzche, and as I mentioned earlier, also Walt Whitman at the very beginning of the essay. These are the ideas she carries of beauty. Her statements on Arbus' photography and subjects are about how Arbus transcends the limited ideas of beauty, to produce a work that accepted another world. Photography is not an art, it is a medium, like writing, than can be used to produce art, document events, entertain, lie and any other thing you want it too. The appeal of this idea is that in is accepting of the numerous claims of the ""purpose of photography"" that Sontag writes about. I've recently taken a fancy for the idea for vignettes and fragmented writing. Photographs are probably one of the most obvious forms of fragmentation and this essay makes a case against . However significant a single event. it cannot embed a wholeness required to understanding. This idea reminds one of the role that the viewer plays in photography. The last section, is a fascinating one. A homage to Walter Benjamin through . Quotes from philosophers, photographers, and even ads of camera makers. There are quotes her that almost entirely oppose one and other. They all sit together in one chapter as if to mock the very ideas of true and false. Taking photographs is an undeniable part of everyday life, and like all widely prevalent activities, it is not thought about by those who practice it. This makes Sontag's essay immensely valuable, especially because she doesn't really come to any conclusion. Of Photography, she says this, but also that. -- A guide to the photos mentioned in the essays - *From , a much better condensation of what Sontag said of Arbus - The critic Susan Sontag divined that Arbus photographed ''people who are pathetic, pitiable, as well as repulsive,'' from a vantage point ''based on distance, on privilege, on a feeling that what the viewer is asked to look at is really other.'' -- May 21, 2015"
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"To think this was published in 1973 - when photographs were just mementos and souvenirs. What have they become now, in the age of the selfie? Sontag, Barthes, Benjamin, etc - many people have written about the semiotics and significance of photography as an ""art."" Photography has been held up as a record of things ""as they were"" - """" says Walter Benjamin, comparing the subjects of photographs to crime scenes. But are photos still treated as such? In the age that we are in now, we seek in photographs not things ""as they are"" but rather ourselves as we could be - an angle or version of ourselves that exceeds our own appraisals and what we deem commensurate with reality. Whether the perfected art of the selfie, or the hundreds of photos taken to be riffled over, discarded, and retaken in search for the elusive one - our preference for modern photographs aligns more closely with creative art than with naturalistic reproduction or historical recording. But more than Benjamin or Barthes, who take at turns a mechanic and romantic view of the art of photography, Sontag's indictments of it seem particularly modern: It is true in our modern day, as it was apparent to Sontag 50 years ago, that people have become addicted to photographs, and indeed that this addiction is a mental pollution. It has given rise to the kind of vacuous celebrity as the Kardashian cadre, famous basically for their cumulative navel-gazing and insipid banter. Photography has not only made us obsessed with ourselves, but has also made us obsessed with the way we are viewed by others, and the way by which we view and judge others. We do not take pictures for ourselves, but for the vacant appeal to the unidentified masses - love me! But do not love me as I am, love me only as I aspire to be, as I can angle and contort myself to be, for the duration of a shutter-click. I have thought considerably about this face-to-the-world society that we live in, for a few years now, and have found its parallel in art. Note the painting: We see Venus, lying in bed, looking at herself in the mirror - or so we think. But if you examine the angles, you notice that it is not possible for her to be viewing her own face in the mirror, because the reflection facing the artist is head-on, it must be that what she sees is in fact the artist. Remove the artist and replace him with the figureless audience of society. It is a perversion of narcissism - not to look longingly at oneself, but to preen and present oneself, gazing into an abyss and hoping for the abyss to gaze back, approvingly. For one, in a society so image-obsessed, the corrosion of beauty with age has made and supported the cosmetics industry to the gargantuan size that it has become. Photographs combat the effects of time. Like Dorian Gray's portrait, the series of photos we present to the world represent our best selves, which are impervious to age and destruction - the time and corrosion which we bear to preserve their beauty. Sontag is quite aware of the role photographs have in preserving a false sense of immortality. They preserve that which is endlessly fleeting. Barthes notes that the subjects of photos are """" They are images chained down and de-contextualized, they simply , and are expected to speak for themselves, while simultaneously being gagged. Yet we don't mind gagging ourselves, silencing ourselves, pinning ourselves down, chaining ourselves to a reality that is skewed and misrepresented - and for what? To appeal to strangers in the void of the internet. We have lost our ability to appreciate the attentions of individuals because we have become so fixated on appealing to the swarming masses. We do not seek love, but orgiastic attention. The photos we take, and more importantly that we curate of ourselves, subvert the content and context of the photograph. We denature the image, we wash it clean of it's history and re-contextualize it to suit ourselves best. We strip each photograph of all meaning so that we can window dress it in such and such a way that flatters our ego and the mannequin that we present to the discriminating masses. There are no morals to photographs - in fact they are tools of deceit, they are an immoral form of art, in that they masquerade as a form of representation and truth. Verisimilitude wearing the mask of veracity. Each photo I present of myself is only another piece of the fake-face I have constructed overtime. As online presence continues to take more and more precedence in our lives, the battle between who are are and who we present ourselves to be will come to a head. We cannot always be our best selfie. Our best photographs of ourselves eventually become photographs of someone who is dead, who is past - a previous version of ourselves that no longer exists and can never be reincarnated."

On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""Cameras are the antidote and the disease, a means of appropriating reality and a means of making it obsolete."" I'm an amateur photographer; after the written word, photography is my favorite creative medium to work in. At one point in here Sontag theorizes about the differences between the writer's craft and the photographer's, and her explanation also gets at why I personally find the two forms complementary: doesn't have an overarching argument or thesis, but if there's one idea that recurs throughout the book it's that photography, ostensibly the medium which comes closest to capturing objective reality, is in fact only ""real"" in a very tenuous (and, at times, insidious) sense. This in itself wasn't a revelation for me. I think anyone who handles a camera in any sort of creative capacity learns pretty quickly that, even before you bring Photoshop into the equation (and Sontag was writing in 1977, long before photo-doctoring became as easy or inescapable as it is now), photography comes with an element of manipulation and selective framing—literally—of the truth. To give an obvious but fairly benign example, a few weekends ago I was out taking photos in a local cemetery with a lot of graves and monuments from the turn of the last century. I was, predictably, going for a Gothic feel of gloom, decay, and antiquity. This mood was threatened by the very modern array of roads, telephone lines, billboards, and buildings which completely surrounded the cemetery, so naturally I framed all of my shots to leave out these inconvenient reminders of the wider world. The resulting photos are ""real""—I didn’t add or subtract anything from them, just selected what angles to shoot from—but they still give only a partial and misleading view of . But Sontag's book is far more than a simple confirmation of what I already knew. What it is instead is best laid out by Sontag herself, in her foreword: That first essay, ""In Plato's Cave,"" is stunning, containing in less than 20 pages more ideas more thoughtfully elucidated than many whole books by other authors. This was my first time reading Sontag, and I was immediately starstruck; one of my first thoughts was ""Wow, she must be one of the most intelligent people I've ever read."" This is an impression which comes from more than just her knowledge of the subject (though her knowledge encyclopedic). It's the talent she shows for the whole process of Thinking, first synthesizing so much raw information, then teasing out seemingly endless insights from it, then conveying those insights in concise, assured, and easy-to-grasp language. It would be pointless to try to summarize all of her ideas here, since nearly every sentence is rich with them, but major themes of the book include photography's inherent subjectivity and relationship to ""the real,"" the almost mystical ability of the camera to freeze and prolong time, the complications that arise when considering photography as an ""art"" along the lines of painting, the aesthetic ideals which have motivated photographers throughout the form's history, the inseparability of the photographic process from technological developments, the implications of living in a world increasingly inundated with photographic images, and the moral and ethical questions raised by the acts of photo-taking and photo-viewing. This last area, the ethics and morals of photography, generated some of the most surprising conclusions for me. It's not like I'd never thought about the ethical responsibilities of photographers—most of us have seen photos of starving children or wartime atrocities and wondered why the cameraperson didn't intervene, have debated about the ways in which various types of images do or should proliferate online, have considered how the male gaze, the white gaze etc. inform the images we see, and so on—but often Sontag seems to question the morality of photography as a whole, to imply that there's a kind of innate harm in the act of photo-taking itself. At times I started to wonder if she was, in fact, photography—which startled me not only because of my own photographic interests, but because I don't think it's a stance I've ever seen anyone else take, or at least anyone from Sontag's general period and social context. In the end I think that's a reductive way of putting her argument—she's more interested in challenging the assumption that photographs are value-neutral or somehow transcend ethics altogether, and also seems to enjoy puncturing the lofty claims of certain influential photographers about their craft—and in fact I learned afterwards that Sontag herself was in a longterm romantic relationship with the photographer Annie Leibovitz. But that doesn't make passages like this any less provocative: Personally I found the provocation bracing, and was even able to smirk a little as Sontag leveled her criticism at photographers and projects which I myself have also been critical of, like Michael Lesy's or Diane Arbus's portraits of ""freaks."" But she's also inspired me to pause and reflect a moment before lifting my camera(phone) to get snapshots I wouldn't have thought twice about before. On the other hand, the book does start to lose a little steam in the second half, as themes begin to repeat and the treatment becomes increasingly esoteric. As invigorating as Sontag is, she's also one of those writers who can be tiring to read much of at one go, simply because of the sheer mass of ideas and the level of intellectual engagement she asks of her reader. I was reminded a little of David Foster Wallace's essays: Sontag's sleek prose is, IMO, way more pleasant to read than Wallace's dictionary vocab and unwieldy sentences, but there's a similar sense of bobbing along on a flood of thought from someone with a seemingly inexhaustible intellect and reference pool. (If possible, read with Google at hand; it helps immensely if you can see the images she mentions.) Finally, I was disappointed by what struck me as a rather Orientalist juxtaposition of western vs. (supposedly) Chinese attitudes towards photography in the last essay, based mostly on negative Chinese press reactions to a documentary on China by the Italian filmmaker Antonioni. I don't know enough to offer any sort of in-depth critique of Sontag's position, but it's a pretty lengthy section, isn't especially crucial to the overall argument of the piece, and read to me as both generalizing and condescending. Overall, though, I found this a fascinating collection. Naturally this subject matter was especially resonant for someone already interested in photography, but given the central role of photographs (and their descendants, films and videos) in virtually all facets of modern life I think the conversation Sontag is starting here is truly applicable to everyone. It's cliché to say that a book is ""more relevant now than ever,"" but nearly half a century after publication it's pretty incredible to consider just how prescient Sontag was and how timeless her line of questioning has proven in a world which has now given us such innovations as digital and cellphone cameras, Photoshop, the selfie, the livestream, the screenshot, the sext, the meme, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Zoom, Google Images, Google Maps, internet porn, execution videos, deepfakes, drone photography, the GoPro, dashcams, doorbell cams, bodycams, 24-hour news coverage, facial recognition software, and photorealistic AI-generated images, to name just a few. In the internet age many of us live our lives predominantly by way of images, images which are more pervasive, varied, and unfiltered than ever before in human history, and rarely stop to think about what that means or how it affects us. After reading Sontag, it's impossible to avoid those thoughts. 4.5 stars rounded up."

In doing this, I turned a 30 year hobby into a sort of job. I completely understand what a privileged position I am in: doing what I have always dreamed of doing but with no pressure to make a living from it. This book has been on my Kindle for a long time as one of those books about photography that I promised myself I would read with all my new found spare time once I stopped spending 50-60 hours a week working. Of course, I found that taking photographs is a lot more fun than reading about photography, but I have this year managed to get round to reading Barthes’ “Camera Lucida” and this. I’m really not sure what I make of Sontag’s somewhat rambling thoughts. It may just be that Sontag’s logic has eluded me, but the book does seem to meander a lot. Along the way, though, it throws out a lot of stimulating ideas. I have seen some people comment that reading this book is likely to make you feel guilty about taking photographs. I found exactly the opposite. With all its talk comparing photographs to reality (the idea of a photograph being more real than reality is a recurring thought through the whole book), comparing photographs to paintings (discussing the age-old question, “Is photography art?”), and with a plethora, maybe even a surfeit, of one-liners that could keep a camera club busy talking for a long time, I found it made me more interested in the possibilities of photography, even if that seems to fly in the face of what often feels like a negative (no pun intended) viewpoint that Sontag presents. It has to be said that a lot has happened in the world of photography since Sontag wrote this in the 1970s. I would really like to see the thinking here extended, as examples, to the world of digital photography and the opportunities for image manipulation that presents, and to the concept of the “selfie” (perhaps especially the way people process images of themselves before allowing the world to see them - I can imagine Sontag would have a field day with that!). In the end, this is an interesting book to read but not as mind-blowing as I imagined it was going to be. That said, here are a few quotes that have stayed with me: (There are quite a few typos in the Kindle edition, so I’ve added the word that seems to make most sense in brackets)."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Like many people before me, I felt a certain dread the next time I tried to pick up my camera after reading this book. Susan Sontag's incredible, penetrating critique of photography doesn't just cast into doubt the value of the activity of taking a photograph, but it posits some of the irrevocable changes that the advent of this technology has had on our world and how we experience it. Anyone who reads this having previously nurtured an interest in photography at any level should experience a degree of nausea while reading. But at the same time, Sontag is genius enough to avoid condemning photography. She reveals the fissures, but doesn't try to fill them with some moral ballast. More than anything, she does what good critics do, she makes observations that open into still greater questions. I only wish she were still around to answer some of them now as we are fulling in the digital age of photography, where the concept of reproducibility has given way to something even more radical."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Q: Why is this book called ""On Photography""? Given that not one word of this book says sustains a single positive sentiment about cameras and their usage, why wouldn't it be called ""Against Photography,"" or maybe ""Photography is the Downfall of Human Kind."" This is not at all the book I thought it was. Given its most quoted statement, ""To collect photographs is to collect the world,"" I expected a somewhat romantic vision of the photographic craft. Little did I know that Sontag credits photography with dehumanization, desensitization to violence and graphic imagery, and our alleged inability to experience reality in three dimensions. With every passing page, my jaw dropped further; how could a woman who was romantically involved with Annie Liebovitz abhor photography so much? ""On Photography"" doesn't have any urgency at all, and though the essays are beautifully written, they strike me as the most misguided of her accomplishments -- melodrama posing as criticism."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Testament to the richness and power of Sontag’s theorizing of photography in this excellent, erudite and consistently readable collection is how seamlessly and silently absorbed many of these ideas are into the overall critical (if not the Instagram-popular) thinking about photographs. That they both arise out of and help to construct a cultural “visual code.” That a photograph both records the real and also changes, recontextualizes, and prompts our reconceptualization of it. The inherent surrealism of what is ostensibly the most realist representational art form. The very question of whether it’s an art form at all, viewed from various angles. That we now both condescend to the so-called “primitive” idea of the soul-stealing camera and also exhibit aspects of it in our own modern relationship to photographs (taking tourist snaps to try to “possess” the places we visit, treating old photos as relics and even talismans). The way the uncanny asserts itself again and again, as photographs both familiarize the strange and estrange us from the familiar. And so on. This is a wonderful collection of essays, though the closing curio-cabinet of detached fragments of quotations about photography from theorists, camera advertisements, and photographers themselves seems pointless. Its juxtapositions have a certain jarring effect that might contribute to the collection (though exactly what, I don’t know), but you could get that effect with 2-3 pages of miscellany rather than 25. I’m sure it was gratifying work to put it together, but it’s only mildly interesting and quickly annoying to read, and hardly seems necessary. The rest, though, is sterling work."

In modern society, a discontent with reality expresses itself forcefully and most hauntingly by the longing to reproduce this one.” (80) “What is this humanity? It is a quality things have in common when they are viewed as photographs.” (111) “As photographers describe it, picture-taking is both a limitless technique for appropriating the objective world and an unavoidably solipsistic expression of the singular self” (122)"
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The first 2-3 essays of the book are just astonishing. I've been perusing Sontag's journals for the past year or so, and her intellectual range leads you perilously near to pure jealousy, but then you concede her anomalous mind and simply admire it instead. This seemingly limitless curiosity and brute capacity for knowledge is best exhibited in those first 2-3 essays (particularly the first two, which is why I keep saying ""2-3""), and also remains less cloyingly didactic there. For example, her consideration of Diane Arbus at length maintains a level of contemplation and engagement - a recognition of both the potentially nihilistic and exploitative registers of Arbus's ""freak"" work and its power of imagination and sidewise cultural commentary - that falls by the wayside in the latter half of the book, where I felt lectured to in a more dogmatic mode. The later essays tend to sound polemical, in the negative sense of that word, rather than exploratory. This, for me, is the key difference between someone like Sontag and someone like Didion, to whom comparisons - at least I've noticed this lately - are often drawn. Sontag centers her self in the essays; Didion seeks always to efface herself, though this effacement can be even more telling than Sontag's calling her own bluff. Point being, Sontag can sometimes irk me because her sexy essayistic writing begins to feel claustrophobic; I feel as if I've been seduced into agreeing necessarily with points that aren't as fully developed as they could be. I want to feel that a claim is arguable, and that the writer has enabled dialogue. In the later essays of this book, Sontag writes her readers into a corner. Either way, certainly the most exciting writing on photography I've read."

There is probably no subject that cannot be beautified; moreover, there is no way to suppress the tendency inherent in all photographs to accord value to their subjects. But the meaning of value itself can be altered "" --- "" Through photographs we follow in the most intimate, troubling way the reality of how people age. To look at an old photograph of oneself, of anyone one has known, or of a much photographed public person is to feel, first of all: how much younger I (she, he) was then. Photography is the inventory of mortality. A touch of the finger now suffices to invest a moment with posthumous irony. Photographs show people being so irrefutably there and at a specific age in their lives; group together people and things which a moment later have already disbanded, changed, continued along the course of their independent destinies.

Questioning the nature of photography--its purpose, meaning, future--Sontag forces us to consider revolutionary ideas about the simple act of ""snapping"" up the world. Of her string of brilliant observations, my favorites include the notion that taking someone's picture is akin to participating in their mortality, the idea that as soon as a photograph is taken, we've witnessed a second of their life expiring. Also equally powerful is the idea that photography--in the realm of war--is essentially encouraging whatever is happening ""to keep happening,"" which is odd and cruel, Sontag claims, when your subject matter is suffering. Sontag, too, explores the role of photography in the realm of the domestic American family, how those who take the most photographs were ""robbed of their childhoods"" and seek to create a world they can control and press into eternity. Similarly, photography becomes a creator of revised memory in families that, under the surface, experience great dysfunction, pain, and disconnectedness. There are thousands of other gems in this genius book, and I can not recommend Sontag's meditation enough for photographers or anyone else disturbed by the prevalence of image in our society, what it means (when we really look at it), and the future of our psychology."

In this volume, she doesn't merely look at photography and describe the experience. Well, she does do that. And then she takes that description and tears it apart and rearranges it into a totally new vision. And she does it all without flashiness or melodrama. Her ideas about the nature of the photograph-- sensitivity to the image, etc.-- have been horribly abused by the Joe Liebermans and Tipper Gores, but in Sontag's hands, they're worthy, interesting ideas, not self-righteous, moralistic drivel."

What interesting history the book must have....I can tell by the quotes that were already underlined the previous owner would have been interesting(underlined any reference to Kerouac etc).... I wish there was a name on the photo's....who knows maybe they will find it on goodreads and see my comments :)..... One question I have is, were these self photo's, or more likely photo's which a boyfriend kept of his beautiful girl on his bus-trip across the country...I don't know why I care, but it feels weird to own a book with so much history in it, other then the authors.... So I haven't even started my review yet, but I feel like I've said so much about it already.... **START REVIEW** The book does a good job at making me, a photographer, reflect on what photography is, despite being boring at times with its repetition. The examination of what photography is as an art and how it relates to previous and future arts is a major focus of the book. Photography's realistic or surrealistic tendencies are examined here extensivly. Additionally the book examines the abilities and limits of photography to interpert or create reality, to modify reality, to create change. Also interesting is a section on what photography means to art. Perhaps as the end of the limited edition?? It was a good book, dealing not at all with the technical aspects of photography but attempting instead to examine photography through the eye of philosophy. **END REVIEW** **START NOTES** p12 Photography as supporting the status quo...ie....photograph will watch pain to get a good shot, but do nothing about it p16 photographs as magical...attempts to lay claim to other reality p17 Images that mobilize consciousness always linked to a given historical situation p18 Korea vs Vietnam Photo's....interesting analysis of why Korea photo's were not important...and COULD NOT have been. p40 Art changes morals; tendency in capitalist countries for art to reduce moral and sensory queasiness. p41 Camera as freeing photographer from any responsibility toward the photographed. p45 Films of Paul Morrissey p54 Surrealism = Bourgeoisie p66 Kerouac quote p 67 Photographer not only records, but invents past p 107 Possible montage suggested (Che's Death, Mantegna's Dead Christ, and Rembrant's Anatomy lesson of Prof. Tulp. p107 Photography as beautifying....even the most deplorable conditions can look beautiful through a photograph. *p111 The force of photography is that it keeps open to scrutiny instants in time which would normally be replaced by the flow of time.**** p 123 Ansel Adams idea that we make rater then take pictures p128 Photographs prefer works not to be printed to the edge of the page for reasons of framing p133 Idea that in most types of photography it is the role of the photographer to minimize his presence, the opposite is true of the fine arts and fine arts photography **p 148 Photography as not an art like painting or poetry but a medium which art can be created....like writing...** p149 Photography(and printing press) as democratization of arts....changing fine arts ideas of originals and reproductions off the map. p 175 What in reality is loose connection, images join....ie an A bomb can be used to advertise a safe."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"An interesting book about the art of photography. The book talks about the origins of photography and its juxtaposition against painting and what the benefits of both are vis-à-vis one another. The book was very philosophical in places and made me look at photography in a completely different way. The book also referenced some of the most iconic photographs of all time. It covered chapters such as: Plato’s cave, American seen through photographs darkly, melancholy objects, and the heroism of vision, photographic evangels and the image world. Best bits in the book were: • Karl Marx attacked philosophy for only trying to understand the world without trying to change it. Photographers suggest that the world is hard to understand let alone change so they just take pictures of it instead :) • Wittgenstein said that the meaning of words is in the use of them not in their meaning. • kindness from people who do not know how to be brave is just sugar coated cowardice • “A capitalist society requires a culture based on images. It needs to furnish vast amounts of entertainment in order to stimulate buying and anesthetise the injuries of class, race, and sex. And it needs to gather unlimited amounts of information, the better to exploit natural resources, increase productivity, keep order, make war, and give jobs to bureaucrats. The camera's twin capacities, to subjectivism reality and to objectify it, ideally serve these needs as strengthen them. Cameras define reality in the two ways essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers). The production of images also furnishes a ruling ideology. Social change is replaced by a change in images. The freedom to consume a plurality of images and goods is equated with freedom itself. The narrowing of free political choice to free economic consumption requires the unlimited production and consumption of images.”"

Her ""obviousness"" is a testament to how influential she has been regarding the visual medium and its molding of both personal and cultural memories."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On Photography by Susan Sontag is a treatise on photography; what meaning it holds, both in Western civilisation, as well as other cultures and how such meaning has changed through the relatively short history of the medium. For non-photographers, it is doubtful whether they would find any value in reading this. However, for those (like me), who have an avid interest, this really is an insightful and influential piece of work. It is the kind of writing that is likely to drive one to question their own work; why do they make the photographs they do? What value do such photographs have to others? What influenced others who came before us? All these questions and many, many others, are answered by Sontag. This isn't an 'easy' read, in the sense that concentration and focus is required to fully absorb the points that Sontag communicates but the payoff for doing so is high. Early on in the book, Sontag articulates wonderfully why people feel such a seemingly irrational fear of having their photograph taken. As someone who wanders the streets, trying see the interesting in what would be either missed, or considered banal by the majority of people, this simple statement gave insight into a problem that I struggled in the past to reconcile with my understanding of photography and what I'm trying to achieve in my images. Sontag also discusses at length the dehumanising effect of photography. How, after being exposed to countless images of misery and suffering, we are eventually anaesthetised to the effect this has on the people in the images concerned. This is fascinating and is no less pertinent today than it was when Sontag created . She writes extensively on the history of the medium, with some particularly interesting comments on the works of Diane Arbus, concluding that the power of Arbus' work is not that it serves the purpose of a parade of freaks, but rather that she successfully scribes a line between those on the margins of society and those who would normally be considered...well...'normal'. The different interpretations of photography that exist between Western culture and others (with the Chinese reasoning behind taking photographs being particularly fascinating), is something that Sontag details in a clear informative manner, with details which seem as fresh today as they were when this work was originally published. The main achievement of this work is that it has stood the test of time. In spite of over forty years having passed since it's publication, many of the points she raises are if anything, more pertinent today than they ever have been. The fact that something almost has to be photographed to be considered 'real' for example. This makes this work particularly powerful for those who wish to find answers to the many philosophical and ethical questions that surround the medium."

On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I felt drawn to Sontag’s writing after reading excerpts of her essays from one of her other works for a class. Her writing is filled to the brim with critical thought, keen observations, and passion. It’s difficult reading (as mentioned by other reviewers, everything seems to contain a new point, and I wanted to take my highlighter to every other sentence), yet it still remains engaging and is rarely dry. As I read Sontag’s essays, I feel like I can imagine her fiercely arguing for the many ideas and questions she posits. Despite not agreeing with it all, I have to love her for that. There’s a lot presented in , and most of it is highly critical. Sontag scrutinizes the role photographs have in our society. Photographs from the past, she argues, not only provide a record but invent one, and those who take them select our understanding of those events in the present. She talks about the way context and culture influence our reactions to photographs, a prominent example being Dorothea Lange’s photographs of Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans being taken from their West Coast homes to internment camps in 1942; the photographs garnered much different reactions later in the 1960s than initially in the 1940s. Sontag also speaks about the motivations of the photographers and what the viewer hopes to gain by looking at photographs. She believes photographers are intrusive, even claiming that photography can be predatory and that to photograph someone is to violate them. While I think she harshly overstates the role a photographer plays, I thought one of the most intriguing points made was about the moral passivity of photographers and a disregard for the pain and misfortune happening around them in order to get a good shot. Not leaving out the viewer, she also brings up our need to constantly be shocked by images in order for them to register with us at all, and how photography can desensitize and dim the emotional reaction to horror. Many questions are brought into play: What kind of harm does having a passive interest in something create? Does something become more real and imaginable or less so after being viewed continuously in the form of an image? Is photography a help or a hindrance to our perspective of the world? Though repetitive at times, I was overwhelmed by how much there was to contemplate and question about the subject, and Sontag provided a conceptual, often controversial angle. After reading reviews and talking to some who have read , it appears that many of its readers, whether they loved or loathed the book, had a lot to consider during and after reading. It’s absolutely worthwhile for that alone."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I first read this book back in 1981, a few years after it was released. Like most of her work, it caused a lot of controversy and gnashing of teeth. I was studying photography at Rutgers and at SVA in NY, and one of my profs was particularly irked by these essays. Something about ""How could this woman who isn't a photographer write such bamsphemy!?! etc."" Being just 20 at the time, I wasn't too concerned about her work because, like most college hedonists, I was focused on the pub and the coeds... If anything, I found her work to be a bit too wordy and above my understanding when she made certain references to psychology, philosophy, and art history - as I said... the girls... Reading the essays now, the first thing that strikes me is the sophistication and academic tone of the writing. Compare her essays to the average digital age writer and it's like night and day. I wonder often how the brevity and simplicity - or let's just call it ""shallowness"" - of internet essays and editorials is affecting intelligence. There were moments when my brain started to ache a little bit as I tried to keep her nested phrases from knocking me out of my intellectual tree! But beyond the writing style, what is most interesting about these essays is how they apply or don't apply to the world of online images in the age of infinite selfies. Now there is unprecedented access to image making technology, including sound and video. Through facebook and its social media cousins, there are images from literally every corner of the globe available with just a few clicks (or taps). I wondered throughout how Sontag might respond to this image-saturated digital world, and I especially wondered what her thoughts would be about the look-at-me narcissism of selfies and camshows, where every woman with a decent ISP can go into the peepshow business and diddle herself for profit - as well as the adolescents and college kids who make dorm-room porn to share with their friends. I wonder if she could even begin to explain the phenomenon....... Recommended for those who remember what ""film"" is and who have a large vocabulary and/or ready access to dictionaries...."

ON PHOTOGRAPHY is still seen as a classic to this day, especially for photographers. Because of this, I went into reading this book with a lot of optimism, yet these were the kinds of quotes I found inside: “The Chinese don’t want photographs to mean very much or to be very interesting. They do not want to see the world from an unusual angle, to discover new subjects.” Or “The only use the Chinese are allowed to make of their history is didactic: their interest in history is narrow, moralistic, deforming, uncurious. Hence, photography in our sense has no place in their society. The limits placed on photography in China only reflect the character of their society, a society unified by an ideology of stark, unremitting conflict.” This is so blatantly racist, I’m actually appalled that I’ve only seen people revere Sontag as a creative writer and thinker. It’s not even that people can’t enjoy aspects of her work, it’s the lack of critical discussion on the pervasive racism in Sontag’s work by present day readers that really bothers me. Like really?"

Her thoughts give faux insights a bad name. This is one long string of ""There is no such thing as a good or bad photograph, only more or less interesting ones"", and that's an above average excerpt. Thank goodness I only listened to this. The Diane Arbus section was the highlight of a boring collection, but I can't imagine the wikipedia entry on Arbus not rivalling Sontag's chapter. The readings of 50s and 60s Polaroid and Minolta advertisements were my only other oases. Most offensive is that her references to Nabokov and Antonioni, two of my all-time favs, were head bashingly dull; and I wouldn't know but her poor judgement of quote quality in general leads me to think she was also basically slandering Walter Benjamin. This book should be more interesting in the age of Instagram, not less. When it comes to time well spent On Photography is a great big phony, and if you think that's a compliment I take it back."

Social misery has inspired the comfortably-off with the urge to take pictures, the gentlest of predations, in order to document a hidden reality, that is, a reality hidden from them. If I reviewed this whilst in the state of mind I had when I first became aware of it, I would probably discuss how camera + photos were nothing more than tools of humiliation growing up, how my obsession with taking photos with one of those pretty looking cheapo cameras sold to newly released amateurs like myself during college was likely an attempt to 'reclaim' photography for myself, how I currently have no pictures up in my living space other than one taken during a seeming reunion at a queer festival with a couple of pre-college friends who quickly revealed that they wanted nothing to do me, that last all in a way symbolizing how much of my younger self I've had to cut away in order to live today. None of that, however, matters. What matters is that Sontag, like many thinker types, is at her best when she minds her own business, and that while this work has in some ways become extraordinarily irrelevant due to how technology has progressed, it would have retained a great deal more of its original value if the author hadn't been so careless in certain key parts. My fault, perhaps, in expecting a general level of skill from an author in all of their writings, rather than recognizing that my own bias that led me first to years ago was not likely going to support me in the realm of a subject that I am largely inured to, or, at best, value in a clinically practical matter. So, while there are phrasings and concepts in this that I see myself making use of in the long term, I don't see myself reading any further of the author. Plainly put, not enough bang for my buck, too much tripe in ratio to the treasure, and when a work can't reach 200 pages without whole slots of Tumblr-style quotes stuffed in its rump, that's saying something. At this work's best, it feeds into a commentary on the modern state of the US, wherein the government has allowed one corporation to continually increase its control over all image production and another corporation to almost entirely take over the selling of all the forms said images take. Someone more satisfied with the status quo would probably imagine I'm discussing Instagram or Pinterest or making yet another jab at Millennial-and-younger-coded paradigms, but I'm talking Disney on one hand and Amazon on the other. Tie in the surveillance state at in the Euro/Neo-Euro landscape, the military industrial complex abroad, and disaster capitalism and its venture philanthropists every in-between, and you really do have a scenario wherein whoever controls the image controls the world. It's why pretty much every mainstream media network is calling that group of fascists that cops let into the US White House a week ago a bunch of anarchists/antifa: the greatest threat to a government that has sanctioned the existence and later attempts of rehabilitation of a group whose claim to fame is mass antiblack lynchings are not groups looking to do more of the same. Sontag's limited by her refusal to take financial stability inordinately blessing certain demographics with prestige throughout the 19th & 20th c. in Euro/Neo-Euro times into account in her art/not art deliberations, but I was still able to see how the anxiety of photography so resembles the anxiety of literature in any country where separation of church and state and subsequent sacrifice of the state to capitalism necessitates that such entities that are largely capitalistically useless, i.e. the Arts, must necessarily substitute in place for the church/moral backbone. Thus the reason, in my corner of the world, library careers founding themselves on diversity/equity/inclusion and reading for ""empathy"" and ""anti-racist"" reading lists, as if someone's expanded subscription to Barnes & Noble is going to save Black Lives Matter activists from mysteriously killing themselves in the backs of police vehicles. The fact that a lot has changed is also indicated by how teaching viewers how to detected photoshopped/fake images is part of my job description, but when it comes to viewing a picture, it's a lot more like leading a horse to water across the board: libraries aren't going to completely combat the influence of pictorial propaganda plastered on every inch of every sector of US society. Indeed, that'd probably entail less funding in the long run. At its worst, the fact that this edition takes the form of a dry and cut collection of pages is quite misleading. It would best be served as one of those obnoxiously large coffee table books, where not a name or piece or museum display is mentioned without the opposite cross section being entirely devoted to relevant images that, despite Sontag's argument that photography inherently promotes equity, are still the ones she chooses to pass around so her dutiful little fans can buy the appropriate material from the appropriate sources and have the appropriate conversations with one another. For this is but one instance of Sontag, at certain key points, doing what I've grown to value most, for my own purposes at any rate, in writings like this: contradicting herself. Now, repetition is all well and good, for it demonstrates that writers are taking a certain care with their personal holisms rather than spewing out whatever's going to make for a good trumped up blog post for the highfalutin crowd and whatever their obsession is at the time. Contradiction, however, often occurs at the juncture between thought and loyalty, and when it comes to Sontag and many others, this is often an indication of conflict between their analysis of the general and their faith in the specific. Take Sontag's repeated juxtaposition of thousands of years of ""Western"" thought with a couple of day's/week's/month's observations of ""Eastern"" behavior, more truthfully rendered as the paradigm of the US/England/France/etc vs some news clippings of China/Japan. A reflection of each country's respective behavior (unruly resistance in the Opium Wars vs cultivated submission post WWII), perhaps? Or consider the fact that Alf Khumalo, unlike every other figure quoted in the back of this work, has to be characterized with ""black,"" ""outbreak of riots,"" ""South Africa,"" alerting to readers whom they are expected to instinctively recognize and who won't be important enough in the long run to merit such. I'm not even going to touch upon the whole ""martyr to the cause of the freaks/the modern necessity to compromise inherent sense of beauty with externalized compassion"" theme Sontag had going on in the second piece of this collection, cause I'm sure someone's going to come out of the woodwork and spout on and on about how you have to read everything else the author's written to get at why she's so committed to drawing the same old mewling and puking lines in the sand of who observes and who is observed. The rich do it and it's art, the poor do it and it's documentary and all that jazz. So, in essence, Sontag presents some effective tools with regards to unpacking photography that can be extended to creative media at large, and then does the opposite in a really predictable manner. ""Dated,"" perhaps, but in ways that, considering both my previous experiences with Sontag and her general reputation, I was more than justified in expecting otherwise. Part of the trend of 'read what you want' that I find so tedious these days is it tends to result in grotesque amounts of artificial positive reinforcement when it comes to the sorts of materials that is publicly deemed as ""acceptable"" to hold in high esteem. Thus, I imagine, why there's this collective blanking out in the more popular reviews regarding the issues I had with this work. There's also the whole 'identity politics' thing that I refuse to gloss over in order to raise the actually successful parts even higher as so many do, but honestly, if there had even been the slightest mention that any of what I encountered was rather off, I wouldn't feel the need to go on about it for so long. Sontag does some interesting stuff, but parts of it come off as more lazy/babbling nonsense/philosophy-lite than anything else because her writing's relative ease of comprehension makes it easy to see where she takes certain exceptions in her own proclaimed generalities just cause she can. It's a shame cause, once material like hers loses its artificial propping up in the form of the usual onanistic ivory towers feeding into onanistic mass public consumption (the fact that she uses 'narcissistic' in place of that perfectly serviceable descriptive is part of the issue), what of it is going to survive? Certain frames of thought of hers are going to remain serviceable so long as settler states are major actors on the field of image production, and I'd rather not have less positive bisexual Jewish woman rep in the world. There's just this whole component of uncritical 'awe' bundled with her and so many of the usual others that doesn't serve me well when I'm determining whether it's worth reading something. I could act in the manner that some seem to treat as a hard won right/badge of honor these days and cut off my reading once the entertainment factor runs out. However, considering what I just said about how such feeds into skewed representation on sites like these, am I going to make the problem even worse? Naaah. This book will survive a few knocks of this type. Otherwise, there's no point to it existing."

It's a superhighway jammed with loaded information. It's good stuff, except i wish it had been more concise or I had had the photographs she was mentioning to cut up the incessant babel of her reflection. Her introspection needs more concrete. Sontag attempts to isolate the photograph as an art form, to insist that But because of the objective properties of a photographic image, to view it aesthetically is to abstract or compound some meaning to the original subject: this. The of Photography is the man who once terms exist, can manipulate them. She idealizes Frank and Arbus who, opposed to ""the man who believed that a spiritual America existed somewhere,' had the is. There are no ""Americans"" as we see them plain, but the insane and disfigured whom have yet to be captured by the eyes--these are Americans. This is the reflection of a completely objective standpoint: Photography. It is unnerving. Which is how, by some weird frame of idealism being subverted, photographs have made reality more . . To show a discrepancy in the norm is . Freaks are at every angle, this is the beauty of Photography. Even in nature there are moments, humanity. A Photographer intends to prove that the past is all that exists. Every moment has been felt in disappointment; nothing is real as it is all too real. It's the past that is made into story. The book is filled with quotes, anecdotes and introspective brouhaha, as to be expected with Sontag’s keen librarian mind. I would delve into this with a Nietzsche quote, It is the wrongness that is exacting, that particularizes the surrealism within reality. It is an idea of staving from direct acceptance to a drifting objectivity which allows either/or interpretations. Nothing is to be taken for granted as all is the flesh of film, it can all be manipulated by our modern “heroes”:"

I stuck with this as she has been said to have made important art history insights here. I don't think this deserve 1* as the essays reference many works and raise some interesting generalizations and opinions on photography and its place in art, especially in comparison to painting. It is to her credit that Sontag can write with brevity and style on a relatively esoteric topic. But I don't think this book deserves 5* as other reviews have clearly pointed out: this book lacks a central thesis, and has essays that are needlessly tangential, political and polemic. Recurrent ideas are met in essays on different topics, and it is particularly difficult to remember any concrete points or categories she loosely makes. I'm going to settle on 3*s as—through a cumbersome style of continual left-branching and hand-wavy observations—she does stay very much photography and went some way to helping me appreciate it as an art form so that when I next go to a museum or see important photographs I might be able to discern for myself what has created their value. Summary of points I found interesting: -Photographs are past 'possessions', paintings past 'representations', and so have a different relation to quelling nostalgia. -A camera appeases the anxiety which the work-driven feel about not working when they are on vacation [...] they are a friendly imitation of work. -To take a photograph is more than passive observing, as you comply with your interest in things in the way that they are, even if this results in another's pain or misfortune. -Contrasting Stieglitz with either Arbus or Evans in the power for photography to describe and promote either the union or alienation of a nation. -What renders a photograph surreal is the distance in time and social class imposed—its irrefutable pathos as a message from time past, and the concreteness of its intimations about social class. It is as if only looking at reality in the form of an object (a photograph) is it really real, that is, surreal. -Photographs have freed writers from the obligation of describing, movies have usurped the novelist's task of storytelling—thereby, some claim, freeing the novel for other, less realistic tasks."

Some of her keen observations on photography are: ""Photography does not simply reproduce the real, it recycles it."" ""To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting yourself into a certain relationship to the world that feels like knowledge and therefore, like power"". She reminds us that we are largely workaholics!

I'm not going to lie though, it definitely felt like a chore sometimes, especially in the middle, so I really had to attack this one to finish it. (she REALLY hates Diane Arbus eh?) There were so many good quotes and passages I could pull from this book, but I really liked when she talked about the inherent aggression that is implicit in the use of a camera, the message of a photograph, even if its a dull, boring, passive photo is ""aggression"". The part about how certain ppl only take photos of ugly things rather than beautiful things to be subversive - folks! what would Susan Sontag think of instagram and our phone cameras 50 years later 😛 I also really liked how she talked about how the viewing time of a film is set by the filmmaker whereas the viewing time of a photograph is however long you want it to be. After reading this textbook, I'm pretty confident that the only real purpose of photography is just for people to say ""oh wow, look how young I look here!"""

Like? Excuse me???? (whereas I think if it were on a more specific topic, e.g. ""digital beamforming in wireless communications,"" I would be less shocked that she knew every Person who'd worked in that field?) Recently I still couldn't really meaningfully differentiate Monet Manet and Man Ray in my head so like this is Outrageous???? But the weird thing about her knowing so much is that I felt not that able to engage critically w/ this book as I kind of just had to take her word for everything e.g.: : ""compared with Warhol, Arbus seems strikingly vulnerable, innocent--and certainly more pessimistic. Her Dantesque vision of the city (and the suburbs) has no reserves of irony. "" : I mean yeah okay susan whatever u say I guess (2) when this was written in 1979 there is no way she could have foreseen Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Google Image Search and like who knew netizens would deal entirely in photos/videos of {friends, food, family, felines, skylines, misspelled Starbucks cup names, a rat carrying a slice of pizza} but that also means when she said photography was obviously linked to the greasing-of-wheels of conspicuous consumption (@Veblen u up?) I was like zamn, u got us good, you sly prognosticating cultural critic. Anyway there's probably already essays written about photography and consumption and Facebook but maybe I will also contribute my thoughts to that eventually probably (3) I was supposed to read this two years ago for class and I'm now fairly sad that I didn't because it maybe would've probably changed the structure of my junior thesis L O L w ho oo p s but it's fine it's not as if I made a long series of regrettable academic decisions that i now angst over in my post-college phase haha!!!"

He noticed my copy of On Photography, and exclaimed: ""Oh that — what an excellent book!"" ""It really makes people stop taking pictures,"" he added after a moment's reflection. Having finished reading, obsessively and from cover to cover, I see what he meant. is a powerful exposition of the psycho-sociological basis of photography. From being a novel but largely unsentimental chemical process to a perversely sentimental art form and a culturally transformative way of seeing and being; photography has brought the idea of an Image to the center of our world in a manner entirely unknown to those who lived before it. In this book, Sontag waxes eloquent about the compulsions, conventions and pretentions of the philosophy underlying the use of a camera. In six brilliant essays, examines a visual custom, stripping it of all the overt romanticization of Barthes' to paint a more analytical ��� albeit discomfiting — picture. Sontag's keenly observant verbal lens brings out the conundrum that photography becomes: its ethical ambiguity, the truly confounding nature of its influence on how human minds and societies work, its subjective objectivity, and its lustful manufacturing of realities. Indeed, as Sontag implicitly points out, photography marks a juncture in the development of society which places us in a realm of multiple irreconcilables — the numbing visuality of our culture is broken here by an absolute lack of photographs (save for the cover) and a final section featuring 'A Brief Anthology of Quotations' (as homage to W B Yeats and his own eccentric collection) which breaks the theoretical topography of the discussion with mixed snatches of touching reflections on the subject. Rare and immensely stimulating, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in photography as a socio-cultural phenomenon, or wishes to ponder with acuity on one of socio-cultural phenomenon of our ages."

On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I wonder if Sontag could have reasonably predicted at the time of writing these essays the image-choked world we would come to know. What would she have to say about the “plandid?” About the “photo dump?” I recently snapped a pic of rain kissed rhododendrons. At the thrift store the other weekend I took a mirror selfie wearing a cowboy hat, and in the background I captured the moving figure of a stranger, his head bowed slightly towards the floor, arms hanging limply, white sneakers in motion. I captured him, and now I will have this image of him that he will never have. I have seen him as he will never see himself. It happened in seconds. Whether or not you agree with Sontag’s musings that to take a picture is in some ways predatory, you can’t deny that there is a certain vulnerability we open ourselves to when being photographed (or a vulnerability we subject others to when photographing them). The first essay in this collection, , introduces us to a philosophy of photography that suggests we still remain in the titular cave, flanked by “mere images of the truth” and attempting to hold the “world” in our heads as a series of pictures. She glides through scenarios which invite us to see the act of photography and the photographs it produces as participatory, complicit, violent, nostalgic, pathologizing, fantasizing, muting. In other words, to photograph is to act and the “art” it produces does something its subject. Not exactly a revolutionary concept to a reader in 2024 (who among us has not been victimized by a friend’s unflattering 0.5 forehead angle shot?), but the value of Sontag’s exploration is clear. The camera does not produce objective work. There is nothing purely true in the photograph. Sontag has a rather dizzying and non-linear way of writing her essays. I’ll admit I needed to chew on sentences, flip back several pages, and, in one case, start all over to make sure I was getting the soul of her argument. Her work rewards this style of explorative reading. One of the essays which I read twice was , an exploration of different attempts to characterize American identity beyond the beauty and the ugly (as Walt Whitman claimed to do). Most fascinating to me was Diane Arbus, an acclaimed photographer who was only interested in photographing those that “looked strange.” What followed her introduction was a shocking depiction of what Sontag would describe as “slow motion private smashups.” Sontag throws the word “freak” around quite heavily in this essay (mostly to describe people with physical and mental handicaps), but the tone shifts toward an understanding that Arbus photographed people of all walks of life to show that we all belong to the same American Family. According to Arbus’ photographic eye, the circus act is no more a freak than a woman you catch a glimpse of in the grocery store. As a consequence of reading this essay twice I took out three collections of Arbus’ work from my local library branch so I could see what the hell Sontag was writing about. Arbus did not disappoint. Rest in peace. is such a difficult read. It’s wordy and overwhelming, but well worth the sifting through little genius quips to get at its soul. I’ll be revisiting Sontag once my brain recovers from the sentence soup. I will leave you all with one of my fav quotations from the final essay :"

My favorite essay was “In Plato’s Cave,” in which Sontag posits that photographs allow people to collect, neutralize, and possess the world. It’s also really interesting to think of how Sontag would’ve expanded her arguments had she been writing in our current time of Instagram, Snapchat, and BeReal. I’m especially glad I read On Photography during this time in my life, when my calendar is filled with travels and my phone is filled with pictures from said travels. Having read this collection, I won’t stop taking photographs, but I’ll reflect more often on whether my desire to take a photo is so that I might preserve a cherished moment or so that I can disconnect from the present and refer to it at a later time. “A way of certifying experience, taking photographs is also a way of refusing it—by limiting experience to a search for the photogenic, by converting experience into an image, a souvenir. Travel becomes a strategy for accumulating photographs. The very activity of taking pictures is soothing, and assuages general feelings of disorientation that are likely to be exacerbated by travel. Most tourists feel compelled to put the camera between themselves and whatever is remarkable that they encounter. Unsure of other responses, they take a picture. This gives shape to experience: stop, take a photograph, and move on.” “Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt.” “Instead of just recording reality, photographs have become the norm for the way things appear to us, thereby changing the very idea of reality, and of realism.”"

Sontag makes a case against photography by citing the very use of photography (why do it?). Some of the passages she wrote almost 50 years ago evoke 21st-century photography on social media, especially on Instagram and how masses are participating in charades that are supposed to make them feel better about life and about themselves. Book explores the historical use of camera and how it has taken over our lives and created a dual identity -- lived experience and lensed experience, and how due to the intended purpose of photography, lensed experience has taken over user's life and created an artificial-lonely- miserable life for them in a capitalist society where everything is being commodified, including beauty, photo documented experience, and almost everything we can think of.

Photography is an elegiac art, a twilight art. Most subjects photographed are, just by virtue of being photographed, touched with pathos.” At one point she mourns the dying art of reading, and to think that this was away back in the 70s, what would she have thought about the current state of reading and literacy in light of today’s hyper-advanced technology and reliance on so many other non-literary devices?... Many a well known name within photography graces these pages, Diane Arbus, Alfred Stieglitz and Fox Talbot et al. She also refers to a wide range of film work, “Man With A Movie Camera”, “La Jetee” and “Peeping Tom” and many others for their visual qualities.

A series of bombastic sentiments without subsequent evidence or substantiation (and often using irritating absolutes: photographs...always; never; only ever...sheesh!) I want more clarity, elucidation and evidence than she gives here. Depth is essential if you want to deal with any subject seriously. With regard to her views on photography, I'm neither moved one way or the other. For the most part I just couldn't connect with her reasoning (mostly the fault of her style) and, after so much effort reading, I don't care what she felt about it. (Much. What did she really feel about it anyway? I was aware before reading how she changed her mind about much of what she'd written. I don't know which parts exactly but there seems an awful lot to choose from.) Probably the fairest essay is the one before last (not counting the lazy assemblage of famous people's quotes at the end). It is Photographic Evangels and is the only one that makes some good sense, and with greater ease, though I wouldn't say it changed my view, or informed me much. Likely it simply confirmed my prejudices, which is not really what I want from a work of this sort. The final chapter-essay I couldn't finish because it enters a stream of consciousness I found too banal to take. Like, it is all the things a photo can be! and the many practical uses thereof: a list. Zzzzzz. I wonder if she timed herself for this. I flicked through the anthology of quotes, the usual suspects. I didn't notice any derogatory ones. I'll offer one which I read ages ago and which, as an on and off amateur photographer, I'm still pondering. It was a magazine interview with Terence Donovan and he said (approximately), ""If you're not getting money from it, it's not worth doing"".

Reading this frustrated the hell out of me at times (more often than not to be honest), BUT I would and probably will do it again. Susan Sontag writes in a way that is the equivalent to beating around the bush while also still saying a lot shit all at once. Her opinions on certain things within and outside of photography seem very misguided and cynical at times. I almost dropped it entirely after getting through her thoughts on Diane Arbus and the “Freaks” she photographed. I powered through it and I’m glad I did. As mush as I didn’t like the things she said in that specific section I feel like maybe that was what she wanted. That wasn’t the only instance of this either. As someone who is nearly constantly thinking about photography and photographs in some capacity I often crave a way to really engage with those thoughts outside of them just being in my head. I was definitely provided that release by reading this. Sontags thoughts are sometimes interesting, sometimes revealing, sometimes infuriating, sometimes redundant, sometimes affirming and dare I say sometimes just straight up stupid. Despite all that they made me think about and dissect photography in ways that I otherwise would not have been able to do easily had I not read this. I can’t give Susan Sontag full credit because again, I do think some of her thoughts are very misguided, cynical and maybe even ignorant at times. Part of me believes that she knew that would be the case but I hesitate to give her the benefit of the doubt. I don’t think this book will provide the same experience for people who don’t often think critically about photographs but I could be wrong.

Sontag's criticism does tend to be contentious merely to be contentious at times, but it is necessarily so-- she is digging underneath in order to overturn a rock, and if a few bugs crawl out, so be it. It is a remarkable view; one seldom seen, in any case. The bugs make you aware that there is life under there, possibilities that had been hidden until she uncovered them. If you see beauty where she sees bugs, it is nevertheless true that she drew your attention to that beauty."

This took me quite a while to read - I kept it in my bag and just read little bits every now and then. This book has so much in it, that it felt good to read it so slowly, and also, now that I have finished it, I know that I'd like to read it again sometime and buy myself a copy too (I was reading a library copy). Even though photography has changed quite a bit - what with digital 'n all - since this book was written in the 70s, it still felt really current and almost timeless. I liked the sections about photographers (especially Diane Arbus), and found the debates about whether photography was actually art (back in the day) really fascinating, as I was unaware that the whole 'is it art' thing was such a big deal. There was the odd bit that didn't really grab me, but generally really enjoyed this and it was much more readable than I expected."

Once again I'm writing this having understood about 60% of the book, but there were standout moments that I am convinced only Astute Susan could write. I particularly enjoyed ""In Plato's Cave"" and ""The Image World,"" both seemed to reflect fears about the modern accessibility of photography that still resonate today. Her discussion of the Art of Photography largely juxtaposed it with painting, although there are a few references to literature littered about. I think the comparisons were fascinating!!! Although once again I am extremely unsure of who she was writing this for and what use this text will have for me after having read it. Mostly I'm just entranced by the way she writes. She is so Gifted I'm obsoosed A number of theoretical questions are addressed but not resolved. First and foremost, the image as a commodity: What happens when photographs are distributed so heavily and possessed by so many? Are they no longer special? What is so alluring about the niche, the ""underrated""? Also, what of photograph's use to provoke sympathy? How do the of photographs transform or become subsumed after they are taken and distributed? (So true bestie) Another fascinating portion of the book is devoted to a discussion of the role of the photographer: are they unbiased recorders or involved ""makers"" of images? A few other interesting quotes that struck me (my goodreads is basically a quotes anthol!!) (This image-world thing–hiiii Plato!– is repeatedly referenced as a concern, very ancient greek philosophy of her...) (I really came away with the impression of photography as such a capacious medium... one seldom thinks of it because the process is so simple usually... I just go click click!) (I wrote ""insane and scary"" on my little sticky note <3) This is really not a technical critique but I like how she goes from being so pretentious to being so critical of pretension... okay me vibes Ultimately many people (my father for one!) will be frustrated by the lack of conclusiveness that these essays (which are really broad, thematic musings) offer, but I found it to be helpful, because as I grow older and question myself more, and submit myself to, say it with me, ACADEMIA, I feel less and less sure of my opinions! So thank you Susan you make essays for girls like me <3"

They age, plagued by the usual ills of paper objects; they disappear; they become valuable, and get bought and sold; they are reproduced. Photographs, which package the world, seem to invite packaging. They are stuck in albums, framed and set on tables, tacked on walls, projected as slides. Newspapers and magazines feature them; cops alphabetize them; museums exhibit them; publishers compile them.” Published in 1977, On Photography by Susan Sontag is a collection of brilliantly written essays presenting her thoughts on photography, photographic images and their place between experience and reality; and I’m absolutely smitten with her structure of thought and writing. In these seven essays, she explores the medium of photography, it’s origin and history with some commentary on various works of photography over the years, the relationship between the subject and the photographer and how we perceive what we see. This is my first Sontag and I’m in awe of her ideas, every essay exploring photography as a medium to retain a piece of past, or drawing a parallel with painting as an art and how they both differ in terms of the aesthetics of the things they capture and reproduce. She mentions somewhere in the middle of the book that how when we experience something in real life, it may not have the same effect on us as opposed to if we see a camera produced image of it. I couldn’t stop thinking about this passage and her few more thoughts along the same lines, relating so much with her idea of blurred reality and emotions. It was so beautifully composed! It took me almost a week to finish this one but it was absolutely worth it! My favourite piece from this collection was ‘The Heroism Of Vision’ and it’s certainly something I’d like to revisit in the future. Sontag’s writing ignites a passion in you and it doesn’t quite fade away! Can’t wait to read more of her😍"
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Really enjoyed Ch. 2, which focuses heavily on the work of Diane Arbus. I had just learned about Arbus in a class on American photography that week, so it was awesome to learn more. Also intrigued by Sontag's interest in China in the last chapter. She was conceived in China since her parents were working in the fur trade industry, but she ended up being born in NYC. Still, she would dig tunnels as a child to try and make her way back to China. The topic comes up several times in her personal essays. She contrasts the overflow of images in the capitalist West with Communist China's ""resistance to the photographic dismemberment of reality."" She points out that close-ups were not used in Chinese photography; photos were mostly used for posed family portraits. In a class on Asian American Art, we learned about how Chinese immigrants doctored such portraits to claim that they had relatives in the United States, and how individual portraits became objects of social currency in San Francisco's Chinatown. Interested to learn more about how artists are making their own meaning out of photos traditionally used to oppress/exclude groups of people. Would love to watch Bontoc Eulogy, in which a Filipino-American immigrant researches the whereabouts of his kin and uses snapshots of the St. Louis World Fair to tell his own version of their story. Also, this chapter made me want to learn about how photography has developed in China. Last fun find in the book for me was Michael Lesy's ."

These thriving ever-present images, obfuscating in our minds even the very objects they reflect, also let us pull exotic worlds closer to us, re-see things in a thousand different ways, re-discover versions of the familiar through detached lenses, hoard and catalog the entire world in our scrapbooks. As Sontag says, photography makes all of us tourists in the realities of others, and eventually in our own. I was especially gripped by the historical tracing of photography’s growing pains, its early desperation to be consecrated as a prestigious “real art” form, and its eventual finding of a distinct identity, which would even lead major photographers to (Humbly? Self-importantly?) reject the “art” label entirely. But photography is quite different from the classical arts, and distinctly of its age - mass-produced, fabricated in an instant, powered by advanced technology, lauded in sleekly-worded adds, unlimited in its potential as journalism or social portrait, and democratic in its aesthetic values, thus making it hard to define “quality” in this medium, for better or worst."

On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have heard Susan Sontag's name before many times, but I was never sure what exactly she is known for. It appears, perhaps more than anything else, Sontag is most known for this prominent collection of essay commentary on photography. It's not a technical manual, or a how to for amateur photographers, but they are rather works of criticism - criticism not of any particular work or artist, but rather of an entire medium. Does it deserve it's fame and prominence? My humble opinion is no. Sontag's style is heady, with a leaden word choice to go with her New York intelligentsia reputation. It all results in haziness. The regular use of words like ""aleatoric"" and the casual throwing around of -isms without explaining which usage of the -ism she means to imply results in a lot of Greek between intermittent islands of lucidity. However, to give credit where credit is due, some interesting and cogent ideas do emerge among the muck: 1. Photography as invasive, appropriative, but also therapeutic because if its appropriative properties. One passage in ""In Plato's Cave"" explains the frequent use of the camera by tourists from cultures ""handicapped by a ruthless work ethic (Germany, Japan, America)"" as driven by the anxiety and desire for a ""friendly imitation of work"" on vacations. 2. Photos are much more inherently ambiguous in meaning, and its interpretation is much more dependent on context, especially the caption that tend to sit below them in displayed settings. 3. Photography is NOT a universal language, because the way we visually interpret images is culturally specific. Sontag expands on the example of photography in Communist China reflecting a very different cultural use of the medium, not to find beauty in the unexpected, but to enforce accepted cultural values. 4. Photos inherently aestheticize it's subject, it finds or (re)defines ""beauty"" by it's nature. The choice of any subject implies the placement of value on the subject by the photographer, it is deemed beautiful, or interesting, or worthy. Even for ""ugly"" subjects, their framing in photos is implicitly a affirmation of the beauty in the ugliness or beauty in the horror. 5. The disruptive effect of photography (and the admittance of photography into the ranks of fine arts) on the arts. Sontag explains that photography is dramatically a more democratic form or craft than previous art forms, both in creation and consumption (everyone can immediately relate to a photo in some way, not so with fine paintings or even music). The dual impulse of photography, to one be a scientific/objective technique for documentation, and two to be an interpretive and creative art form are at perpetual tension with each other throughout the history of photography. 6. ""Cameras miniaturize experience, transform history into spectacle. As much as they create sympathy, photographs cut sympathy, distance the emotions. Photography’s realism creates a confusion about the real which is (in the long run) analgesic morally as well as (both in the long and in the short run) sensorially stimulating."" 7. ""The force of a photograph is that it keeps open to scrutiny instants which the normal flow of time immediately replaces. This freezing of time—the insolent, poignant stasis of each photograph—has produced new and more inclusive canons of beauty. But the truths that can be rendered in a dissociated moment, however significant or decisive, have a very narrow relation to the needs of understanding."""
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I picked this book up in library's recently returned books pile because I had it in the back of my mind that Sontag is a great essayist and also I like photography and analysing my own relationship with it and also because I needed a lightweight book for carrying around in my bag. The book was quite easy to read despite the lack of context I had about many photographers and other historical figures that Sontag mentions in her essays, but that was probably because she didn't go too deep into analysing particular artists (except for Arbus' works and the extra context her suicide adds to understanding them) and just used them as a background for her sometimes contradictory statements. Nevertheless it was an enjoyable read and even though the book was written in 70s, some points still stand today. Like, if we take nowadays' obsession with photoarchiving our lives on Instagram and other social media and taking neverending selfies - Sontag notices that we, people from industrialized countries, desire to be photographed, because we feel that we're only images (like Plato's shadows) and taking a photo of us makes us real / gives us the sense of realness - as opposed to some cultures where taking a photo without asking is a disrespectful act, like robbing a person. I guess we all know that one person who simply cannot stand being photographed - this book could give that person even more excuses - like the one from Balzac, who thought that with every photograph taken a thin ghost-like part of you disappears. Sontag makes an interesting point about photography being some sort of a sublimated aggressive act or just an attempt at controlling our surroundings. Obviously, a lot of attention was also given to photography's relationship with fine art, like paintings. I liked the observation that time raises most photographs, even the most amateur ones, up to the level of art. I cannot say that I did learn something particularly new about history of photography or the techniques that I didn't know (I shouldn't have expected that), but it was a useful read for checking my own and my culture's relationship with photography and 3 stars reflect this."

I for example did not agree with all her ideas presented in this book, but still enjoyed reading them. I found them interesting views and they often caused me to think over my own ideas about photography, media, women etc. If you don't agree with her, she presents such good writing and arguments that it makes you think over your own views and stimulates you to try to find arguments to support your own thoughts.

I can see she’s fiercely intelligent and erudite, and yet I also question her type of intelligence – is this a wise intelligence? Sontag is too humourless and categorical for me. She paints the picture (or takes the photo?) of humanity in truly broad brushstrokes, continuously generalizing about what people want and what makes them tick. Her critique of photography as such and of known photographers is relentlessly cynical. Her voice is cold. Some of her observations are strikingly banal. Still, if you take Sontag with a big bowl of salt, then some of her ideas on how photography changed our world, particularly our everyday experiences, and her argument that photography’s influence on fine art wasn’t as great as we tend to think, are illuminating."

What is not made clear is why that is so. ""The medium is the message"" seems a cop out... Reading this again it is interesting to see that Sontag's views still hold water. She has clearly looked at a lot of pictures and given much though to the whole business of photographs, photography and photographers. Surprising too is the idea that the image has replaced reality and the photograph is more immediate than reality. He review of the attitude of the Chinese government to photographs was also enlightening and comforting too."

On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"There's absolutely no doubt that this series of essays, and particularly the first essay, trailblazed a dialectic materialist critical analysis of photography. Susan Sontag systematically, caustically and with seductive and emotionally charged prose dismantles the relationship between photographer and camera, photographer and subject and photography and art through the lens of exploitation, capture and dissociation. Her criticism of photography stems from the exoticization of class and the bizarre and the capture of the alien by those of privilege. The second facet of her critical lens on Photography the art form is a prolonged discussion of the contrast between the art of painting from which photography coopted a lot of its linguistic terms and technicalities that determined aesthetics. While Sontag regularly describes how the movements in painting and literature caused a directed shift in photographic trends, she also describes how the immediate and 'perfect' mass manufacture of photograph causes a divergence of philosophies of what makes a particular photograph 'good' as contrasted with the aesthetic value of a specific portraiture or painting. The third theme that Sontag explores in On Photography concerns her perspectives on the evolution of the various photographic movements as she perceived it. She explores the effects of the quickly changing technological landscape that would dramatically change the perceptions of what made a good photograph and explored the psychology of photographers - who she observed gradually eschewed the capture of the exotic to capture moments of surprising verisimilitude and pathos in subjects that were the mundane. Sontag's prose is incredibly erudite and drew me in moments into my beginning her book. Her emotional and polemical rhetoric resonated with my own subconscious concerns about the exploitative nature of a lot of photography and the lens of privilege and exoticism I could see in the way photographers and videographers (especially in the West) have historically portrayed and continue to portray to this day of my place of residence as well as the Global South in general. Yet, the more I read, the more I started to develop a sinking feeling in my stomach. Orwell's quote about the power of well written rhetoric surfaced in my mind and I decided to pause my reading of this work for a while so that I could cool off my emotions and read again, with a critical and detached point of view, Sontag's actual arguments and not get pulled into her rhetorical flourishes. I must admit that I haven't found an author so challenging to not be constantly swindled into an emotional frenzy before. Sontag's wordsmithing is just too powerful and just resonates with me on some level. Her criticism which betrayed an cadence of rebellion against the then mainstream thought on photographic aesthetics and the undertone of despondency over the evolution of the medium infected some of my own subconscious frustrations with photography and media of today's world of social media and information overload. However, reading Sontag's essays on photography after having cooled down, I felt a lot of things off that I just felt hard to pinpoint. Photography, Sontag says is inherently 'unreal' and the illusion of capturing reality it portrays that has convinced most of the world to use it as a proxy of evidence, nay, the actual reality itself is a fraud. The questions about the exploitationary nature of a photographer capturing the bleak moment of a subject's vulnerability during an absolute moment of horror (be it war or abject poverty or whatever else) could be asked about any other art form as well. A literary work describing the horrors of a particular people are also exploiting their situation for the personal profit of the author. The same could apply for painting or music. If this disqualifies photography as an art, so it does to any other art form then. Is Sontag trying to eliminate art altogether? Her life would tell otherwise. In On Photography itself, she makes it a point to dissociate films from the still horror that photography induces. Videography, claims Sontag authoritatively and even dismissively, captures people as they really are. Photography, according to her captures a moment in time that humans cannot every isolate in their own perceptive capabilities. Thus, photography is not a representation of reality. Are atoms and molecules not real then because our human senses cannot perceive them? Are microorganisms a fiction? This bizarre brain in the vat intellectually vacuous argument is at odds with Sontag's own dialectic materialist take on the social implications of photography. I could go on and on about how simultaneously a joy it was to read Sontag's fluid prose while growing increasingly frustrated with the growing incoherence in thought and analysis. The bit about the camera being a replacement for a gun and that to capture a photograph was the equivalent of a rape were rhetorically successful in bamboozling me for a moment but a single ounce of critical reading of her implications would cause you to sneer at the absolutely ridiculous propositions she makes. Did Susan Sontag hate photography? Did she hate art? Or was she jut trying to be a contrarian in a time when photography was quickly overtaking the other art forms in popularity and public influence? It's honestly difficult to say. Sontag's own life is a mish mash of contradictions and she seems like the type of critic who gives a lot of advice but fails to follow it herself. Even if I am being harsh on her for her manipulative writings in On Photography, I think there's a whole lot in there that is thought provoking and even shocking. I should note the biggest hypocrisy in Sontag's book is the bit about exploitation. She rants and raves about photography being exploitationary. Yet, she herself capitalizes on a dead artist's suicide to trivialize her life's work and misrepresent her art (Diane Arbus). All to sound provocative and for shock value. It was the most loathsome moment in the book for me personally. Despite all these conflicted thoughts, I can't help but give five stars to the book. I don't think I've read a book that's left me as provoked and conflicted as this one has. This book needs to be read very carefully and with a very critical lens. For it is very easy to fall for the leaps of thought lacking logical consistency Sontag manages to achieve using the power of brilliant rhetoric. More than anything, this collection of essays demonstrates the power of the pen."

It still is. As an aspiring photographer who wants to capture responsibly and not just instinctively, I will always keep some pointers in mind from Sontag's eclectic collection of essays. Will keep returning to this book time and time again. How gorgeous they are! Next up, Barthes' Camera Lucida for sure. A few wonderful lines by Sontag and short quotes from the last section of the book: ""To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed."" -Susan Sontag ""While real people are out there killing themselves or other real people, the photographer stays behind his or her camera, creating a tiny element of another world: the image-world that bids to outlast us all."" -Susan Sontag ""To take a photograph is to participate in another person's mortality, vulnerability, mutability."" -Susan Sontag ""To photograph, according to Arbus, is necessarily 'cruel, 'mean.' The important thing is not to blink."" -Susan Sontag ""After seeing these pictures you end up finally not knowing any more whether a jukebox is sadder than a coffin."" -Jack Kerouac in the Introduction to Robert Frank's book The Americans ""But photographs do not explain; they acknowledge."" -Susan Sontag ""I longed to arrest all beauty that came before me, and at length, the longing has been satisfied."" -Julia Margaret Cameron ""Your photography is a record of your living, for anyone who really sees. You may see and be affected by other people's ways, you may even use them to find your own, but you will have eventually to free yourself of them. That is what Nietzsche meant when he said, ""I have just read Schopenhauer, now I have to get rid of him."" He knew how insidious other people's ways could be, particularly those which have the forcefulness of profound experience, if you let them get between you and your own vision."" -Paul Strand ""To experience a thing as beautiful means: to experience it necessarily wrong."" -Nietzsche ""If I could tell the story in words, I wouldn't need to lug a camera."" -Lewis Hine ""I photograph what I do not wish to paint and I paint what I cannot photograph."" -Man Ray ""You can photograph anything now."" -Robert Frank ""New forms in art are created by the canonization of peripheral forms."" -Viktor Shklovksy"
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On photography by Susan santag is the confectionery for anyone who takes photography seriously or appreciates it truly. It is a collection of essays on philosophical, critical, educational, and appreciative approaches to photography. My favourite essay from the book is “The Heroism of Vision” which reads like “Nobody ever discovered ugliness through photographs. But many, through photographs, have discovered beauty. Except for those situations in which the camera is used to document, or to mark social rites, what moves people to take photographs is finding something beautiful. Nobody exclaims, “Isn’t that ugly! I must take a photograph of it.” Even if someone did say that all it would mean is: “I find that ugly thing … beautiful.” Many people are anxious when they’re about to be photographed: not because they fear, as primitives do, being violated but because they fear the camera’s disapproval. People want the idealized image: a photograph of themselves looking their best. They feel rebuked when the camera doesn’t return an image of themselves as more attractive than they are. Instead of just recording reality, photographs have become the norm for the way things appear to us, thereby changing the very idea of reality, and of realism. I gave it 4 stars, it's an immersive read. P.S. If you don't have time to read the whole book, at least browse “on photography quotes by Susan santag” and believe me you would solely want to seize those words. few quotes I took away are ‘To collect photographs is to collect the world.’ Desire has no history... To take a photograph is to participate in another person's mortality, vulnerability, mutability. precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time's relentless melt. To suffer is one thing; another thing is living with the photographed images of suffering, which does not necessarily strengthen conscience and the ability to be compassionate. It can also corrupt them. Once one has seen such images, one has started down the road of seeing more - and more. Images transfix. Images anaesthetize."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"'photographs...are incitements to reverie... implicitly magical, they are attempts to contact or lay claim to another reality.' extraordinarily insightful, with surgical precision, Sontag dissolves not only how photographs work, but how they work under capitalism; bring us closer together, push us further apart, desensitize us, rally us, quash us and uproot us. how they distance reality, yet form their own. how they are manipulative, and how they are 'beautiful'. how they are related to art, and how it is denigrating to the form to be considered as such. however, there are drawbacks. spending the best part of a chapter denigrating Arbus' work, without properly engaging with what Arbus actually does, results in an unfortunate comparison between Warhol's Catholic upbringing and her Jewish one, as if her Judaism is implicit in her art, and thus its perceived negative quality. similar ignorance is payed to the Chinese, where the assumption is that Chinese society does not 'want photographs to mean very much or to be very interesting', without exploring a single chinese photographer (or even one Chinese photograph!), nevermind providing any evidence to prove these claims. similar arguments, not based on questionable othering grounds, can be weak as well. yet On Photography is remarkable, and touches on everything from Whitman to Polaroid ad campaigns in its effort to understand and display the authority that photographs hold over our day to day lives - things we are often passive to. Sontag goes beyond the usual ""photographs can bias a situation"" or ""provide unnatural standards of beauty"" to far more insightful, cutting arguments on how humanity's relationship to any image culture can work. she makes leaps of judgement upon occasion, and often presents opinion as fact. yet when Sontag argues, Sontag illuminates incredibly."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Surprisingly I enjoyed this quite a bit less than Regarding the Pain of Others, but I can’t quite put my finger on why. It may be due to the level of authority with which it felt like Sontag spoke in Regarding the Pain of Others. Everything in that collection felt so tightly nit and drilled down, that she would never float from subject to subject. Sontag touches unreachable levels when going hammer and tongs at an argument, so flitting from one thing to the next feels like one is being cruelly toyed with. This collection, on the other hand, does float a lot more when compared to her other work, and while being a wonderfully interesting read, I don’t find that the majority of the arguments carry quite as much weight. Some of the arguments feel stripped down to the point of a singular biased voice, with no backing from any evidence or research. It’s always interesting to hear what Sontag has to say, but her arguments rarely reach the pedestal of those managed by her other work. Nothing I have said or rambled about here is of any worry to you as the reader if you come to this solely for Sontag’s individual thoughts. As an academic, she holds an authority in her own voice for those that consider her to be of any importance. If you are to remove the relatively thin nature of the considerations being put forward, then this book is still a treat to have on your shelves. The pieces are likely to leave a feeling of dread that has become synonymous with Sontag’s work, and you may never want to pick up a camera again once you’ve reached the final pages. I only wish that we had Sontag around now to comment on the burning hellish cesspit that is modern society, so long as she drilled down and didn’t merely flicker."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I must be honest - I really enjoyed this book and feel like it has gifted me with a richer, more complex, subtle and overall complete vision of photography, a medium to which I have been finding myself more and more interested as time passes, but I found the writing dense, complex and demanding of significant effort - maybe I'm just not that intelligent... It's a book which requires effort, even if it compensates for that effort more than fairly. The book is divided in six essays in which Sontag develops her thinking around the topic of photography, in the multiple dimensions and meanings it can have. She is an unconstrained thinker and writer, allowing the reader to follow her thoughts on whatever topics arise - history, art, sociology, always in coherence with the central ideas. I loved this aspect. As someone who's passionate about visual arts, my favourite essay in the book was 'Photographic Evangels', which offers a rich and nuanced reflection on the role of photography as an art and its relationship to painting, as well as to museums and galleries. It will surely change my perception of photography (and painting, in relation to it) from now on - I have now thought about how the medium was born, the functions it performs, how it challenged painting, how it differs from other visual arts, how the photographers who have shaped it thought... For those interested in photography, visual arts or even visual cultures broadly, I would recommend dedicating this book the time and attention it deserves."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Remember that this book was written in the Seventies. That explains a lot. The first half is the better, more accessible and practical and useful. The second half goes into lengthy discussions of specific photographers and why they have an exhibition about toilets or cigarette ends, or why the Chinese might come around to photography but won't be using it for surveillance (think she was wrong there). Photographs also are explained in their past in the early part, from the first pages with daguerrotypes, camera obscura and the like. By the later pages photos are only discussed as an art medium, expensive, subjective, upper-class in nature. Today with more photos being taken in one year than in the entire previous history of civilisation, it's hard to take that view seriously. I found some useful quotes in the first half, about Dorothea Lange for instance, about the way we see and remember images. A comparison with Lange is Diane Arbus, but these days we don't like Sontag calling her subjects 'freaks.' Most of the other photographers cited were men, of course. I found a useful book to read alongside this one is Dyer, G. (2007) The Ongoing Moment. Vintage. If only because Sontag's book contains no pictures and Dyer's book does. However, they are both American writers, writing about American photographers. I borrowed this book from the DBS Library. This is an unbiased review."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book was a very pleasant surprise. I bought it on a whim in a museum shop, expecting some book about photography… which it is, but it also is about everything but that. This book is centered around photography. However it delves into its philosophical, sociological, historical, artistic aspects and more. Susan Sontag is an incredibly skilled writer and shows great knowledge about many topics. Even though this book came out in 1977, it still holds up today. It made me reflect on photography in ways I had never done before. Will it affect me in my future photography? Probably not. But I thoroughly enjoyed this read. There are only two aspects that I can criticize about this book (one not being the books fault). First, Susan Sontag has such a great amount of knowledge, that it is really hard to follow her in every argument. I missed a lot of references, which made it a hard read at times. Second, I feel like some arguments are too one-sided. We get the author’s opinions and only these opinions. I sometimes wish, she would have relativize more and given a more rounded out argument. But if she had done so, this book probably would not have as much charm. This is definitely a book I will have to come back to in the future. Thank you for reading"
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them that they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. Just as a camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a subliminal murder - a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time. Known to be one of the foundational text on photography, this series of essays delivers and argues, in one of the most eloquent, intelligent*, and passionate style, a mode of thinking on the photography's nature, use, status, style, and philosophical implications. Given these essays first appeared in a literary magazine in the 60s, many of her thoughts, like the quote above, have become common knowledge or entered lecture notes of Photography 101. It may not have aged well in our Tiktok-ified world where the video format is on the verge to, if not already, dethrone (digital) photography. But that style alone is worth most readers' time, a time spent mostly reflecting and highlighting the passages. *She referenced to, without assuming knowledge, various thinkers but readers should know Plato's allegory of the cave."
On Photography,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52372.On_Photography/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"These days, photography feels like one of the most important vehicles to build The Society of the Spectacle along with social media which is oversaturated by photographs. It was not always like this. Through Sontag's eyes, one can understand photography in quite a different way. To me, this book contains some ideas that may change how I look at photographs fundamentally. Sontag touched, in these insightful essays, some key points of photography. Most of them deal with photography's relation to art. In her view, photography (though denied by many proponents) is a modern art. It embodies modernism more than painting and poetry in permissiveness and ambiguity of aesthetics, subject matter, and expertise. She also explored the social side of photography quite a bit, especially how tourism, memory-making, etc fundamentally changed after the wider acceptance of photography. It is a pleasure to read. Sontag can express quite succinctly her point with a storyteller's captivating charm."

This book comes very highly recommended by me. James Gurney's coverage of the topic of colour and light is comprehensive. Plus it is accessible art instruction of a very high order. I've not come across any other book about colour by a practising artist and illustrator which covers this topic in such breadth and depth and makes it accessible as well. * I've got ones which are more technical - but they're much less accessible. * I've got ones which are as accessible - but they don't cover as much as he does * It does not attempt to dumb down or omit important aspects of the way in which colour and light function and interact. * It articulates very clearly how you can make choices about how to use different features of colour and light in a painting. * it makes excellent use of images and graphics This is a book for students and improvers and all those who want to know more about colour and how light and colour interact - in life and in a painting. I am so confident about the impact of this book that I am happy to predict that if you buy and study this book your paintings will improve!

Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter (Volume 2),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8384010-color-and-light/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"(More pictures at parkablogs.com) is the latest book from and it's fantastic. It is a very accessible guide that's filled with interesting and useful information on color and light. It's fortunate we have so many colors today at our disposable, and now with this book, something to help make sense of them. The book talks about color in a very practical sense, as you would see them in life. The lessons are observations of light and colors from James Gurney's years of painting experience. He brings his points across with his own beautiful paintings as examples, clearly explaining why and how he uses colors. It amazes me the amount of work James Gurney has created over the years, and this book is filled with them, from his plein-air to Dinopedia paintings. There are lessons on sources of light, light and form, understanding the color wheel, how light reacts with surfaces and other elements, and visual perception. You'll learn interesting things like why the moon looks blue, when happens to light when it travels through green canopy, tips on mixing colors, and a whole lot more. There are lots of tips and techniques included. The book is also well researched and I enjoy reading the history of color as they were used in the past by other artists. It's really a no-brainer to pick this up if you're into creating art, or even if you just want to check out the beautiful paintings in the book. Highly recommended reference. And you should also check out his other book ."

All to often, they devolve into breaking things down into a series of steps, or simply showing a the different stages of one image. While this breakdown might be helpful in creating that one painting or drawing, it rarely helps you develop the skills needed to apply to original work. Thankfully, Color and Light is not that sort of book. Instead it is a wonderfully useful guide to how color and light works and how to incorporate them into your artwork. That’s another benefit of the book – since it focuses on color and light and not on a specific medium, it is applicable for all sorts of media and field. While it’s geared towards artists, either traditional or digital, who create their artwork from the ground up, the information on color schemes could also be useful to a photographer. This book is full to the brim of all sorts of useful information, from different types of lighting, to ways to think of the color wheel, to how you create different surface effects. Each topic is covered in a two page spread, which, while simple, effectively conveys what you need to now. Which brings me to another topic. I can’t believe that I’m already five paragraphs into this review and haven’t mentioned how wonderful James Gurney’s art is. If you know anything about James Gurney, you’ll know that he’s the creator of Dinotopia, and luckily for us, he uses his own highly imaginative and beautiful paintings to help illustrate the principals in his book. If you are at all interested in art, this is a book that you should at least flip through. Even if you don’t create your own artwork, you may very well want to marvel at the beauty inside this book."

However, it is a little ""hand-wavy"" as most art books unfortunately are. James Gurney at least stays away from weird mythical art mumbo-jumbo, as he actually has a formal scientific background (archeologist). He has a very active, informative blog on which you can see his rather rigorous methods. This book is more like a discovery channel documentary than a serious textbook. Nonetheless, Gurney's attention to detail shines through and he at least alerts you to the existence of very subtle phenomena like that the difference in atmospheric density at high altitude IS artistically relevant. I treat this book as my little library of such isolated tidbits."

I learned more in this book than I ever learned in my college days - in art classes, illustration courses, color theory classes, etc. Each topic is broken down into manageable chunks, usually spanning a two page spread, and illustrated with examples of the topic at hand, and usually from the author's own works. I appreciate the valuable lessons on color and light, and the practical explanations of how to employ each idea. The book doesn't tackle the other great skill of artists, composition, which is probably just as important as color and light, but then it's not a total course. A good compositional theory book would be an ideal companion. Gurney is among the best teachers, I'm grateful to have discovered him and his books."

This is not a ""how to"" book with specific suggested lessons, but every page has information that can be used for experimentation. The book is beautifully illustrated, mostly with works by Gurney, which visually explain each point the author is making. Since James Gurney works primarily in oils, this book will be especially appreciated by artists who work in that medium, though the principles can be applied to any technique."
Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter (Volume 2),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8384010-color-and-light/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"If you're interested in learning to draw form, Bridgman and Loomis stand pretty tall as classics (though Scott Robertson's How to Draw is also essential if you're interested more in industrial design and modern techniques for perspective). The giant gap that modern art left between decent traditional art education and cheap full-color books meant most classic texts on painting focus too much on medium and not enough on color theory - and when they do try to talk about color, they sound like philosophers attempting to describe it the colorblind. Every single page of Color and Light is full of gorgeous paintings that make the concepts in the text intuitive and revelatory. Even if you have no interest in working traditionally, this book is worth your time."

It turned out to be a fraud. An ignorant quotes any source he found and randomly throws in color reproductions.

Terminology: • Incandescence – heat; Luminescence – cold; Fluorescence – conversion of non-spectral light to spectral light • Contre jour lighting vs flat lighting (eliminates shadows and stresses graphic shapes and design) • Notation of paints: ex Cadmium yellow light – ‘light’ indicates ‘more yellow’, ‘deep’ indicates ‘more red’ • ‘The subjective neutral’ of a gamut is the white balance bias • the ‘saturation cost’ of a triad denotes the limits of the palatte • An ‘atmospheric triad’ is a triad that does not cross the central circle of greys • In order to model form, one must understand the light source; by locating the light source, one can easily locate the terminator on the form. Improve: cast shadows and dark accents where form meets form • Foliaged trees vs sparse trees should have different modeling of form. • Liven green color by painting over a warm underpainting, or putting in some grey reds. • Stretch dappled light into ellipses according to their angle of incidence from the sun. • In weak light, blue-greens appear bright. This phenomenon is called the purkinje shift. • One can no longer observe the floor of a running stream at around 3 feet • The color red disappears at 10 feet • Caustics do not extend beyond 20-30 feet • Orange and yellow disappear at 25 feet • Ever deeper depths preserve only violets. • At times reflections/bending of light center around the viewer’s viewpoint, radiating from that point to create a circular effect. This effect is due to ‘anisotropy’ caused by the direction of the light, such as in stainless steel metals and frost-covered branches in a forest. • The sky color different when one is facing the sky and when one is facing the antisolar point (at 180 degrees from the sun) In a cloudless sky, looking into the sun will create the effect of an almost dark grey-green sky. The sun will have a lighter and warmer corona. • Right after sundown (when the sun is at 95 degrees), one can observe the ‘well of the sky’ by looking straight up. • Atmospheric perspective will cause shadows and objects to mis with incremental amounts of sky color, as a function of distance. However, white objects will become warmer while gradually losing strength as they near the horizon. For example, roofs will keep their brilliancy, while clouds near the horizon will become redder/ more orange. • Rainbows form at about 42 degrees above the antisolar point, while a secondary rainbow forms at about 50 degrees. The band of sky between the rainbows will appear darker. This area is called Alexander’s dark band."

It has opened my eyes to the importance of light and color, beyond what I’ve already knew; now in fact I see those fields as the base to any kind of art. Needless to say, I found this book very useful. It covers difficult concepts and theories in a simple way that it’s easy to understand without sacrificing a professional outlook at the subjects in hand. The book is very well organized and covers everything one needs to know in a gradual way in terms of difficulty. I liked the examples given to support the information, I wish there have been more examples of how others artists accomplish what was described (also as a mean to widen my knowledge in art); but still the art offered was perfect to exemplify and I have to say that James Gurney is a fantastic artist. I also have to highlight how the examples sometimes went above and beyond in a positive way, with the author taking pictures of the changes of color in different light, the changes of ink after long exposure or creating with Photoshop color wheels; I applaud the dedication. The same can be said about the little scientific tidbits and even mythological facts that laid under those theories about colors that today we accept as correct without question, it was all very interesting. One thing I also have to add is that, while the teachings given in this book can apply to every form of art as they are concepts that serve as pillars for every creation, the book focus more on traditional art. It’s understable since that’s the medium that the author uses on his works, but at the same time some chapters referring to pigments or tricks to paint in open air may not be for everyone; just a heads-up. And yes, some concepts need to be translated to the medium of preference for the reader, but I think one can do that work without being an expert, so as I said, the book I useful. All in all I have to say that I’ve enjoyed the reading, which was light but complete, and that I think I’ve learned a lot."

The book, physically, is extremely well made of quality paper and is quite heavy. The reproductions are excellent. This is one of several books that I would recommend as required reading for any artist. This one should be a required text in Senior yr art and also in college painting classes. (Also, Carlson’s Guide to Landscape Painting). The earlier the better. However, even an experienced artist gains much information from reading this book, especially one looking to pursue a career in illustration. I have painted plein air for many years and the examples in this book give some fun things to try. Gurney explores the science behind what we see when painting plein air. The book was a genius idea to write because it helps explain what we see and paint intuitively and knowing the science behind what we see, makes for a better painting. This took a lot of work and research and it is worth it!! Thank you James Gurney!"

There are just so many different approaches and possible goals in making art. That said, Gurney does an impressive job of balancing different perspectives and packs a ton of information in just over 200 pages. It lives up to the hearty recommendations I have seen for it. This is one of the first guides I have read that considers both the digital painter and the traditional painter, and makes itself useful to both. It presents the basics of many schools of thought and both sides of debates, such as premixing vs free mixing and the mud debate. I was primarily instructed with one side of these debates while leaning toward the other, so its useful to know that the other side exists and has its merits. It also tries to balance the scientific and perceptual sides to color and light, leaning toward perception because perception plays such a massive role, but still including the basic understanding of and that an artist will need to design their own paintings."

I was expecting based on the promotion for the book to be more of an educational book, with more teaching, instead a good portion of it seemed to be oriented towards showcasing the author's works and trivia. I would have appreciated it even more if the great works would have been dissected more and more of the descriptions would have been about the how to do it and less about the stories behind his particular works, the stories about the actual content, not about how he made it/problems he hit & how he solved them. That being said there is a LOT of interesting and fascinating content in there that got me thinking about a lot of stuff, and his skills and works are a great role model and inspiration for harder work.

I'm working off a PDF copy but would highly recommend getting your hands on a physical one just to look at the artwork themselves. An extremely valuable resource for color theory and lighting. The book is not dry at all and offers examples of artworks when discussing techniques and color theory. It covers a variety of lighting types with clear diagrams and examples. Do note that to get the most out of this book, you'd have to practice the discussed topics on your own. The author clarifies that this book is not intended to be a step-by-step guide so the practice is needed. Although Gurney mainly focuses on traditional painting, the contents is still applicable to digital artists. People might mistake the trad focus for it not being helpful in digital but that's not true. Digital artists will have to learn how to control/edit their brushes and find out how their program operates. Traditional art skill will transfer to digital and vice versa with enough practice."

I'm looking again at this lovely, lovely book. It will certainly make a handy reference guide later on, but its real power is its scientific approach to painting. It doesn't go far enough, but that would make it less approachable. It is good to hear from a professional that realism is not the slavish copying of nature to the point of imitating photography. Such an approach is visible around the internet and is discouraging for those who don't have the patience for it. One of my criticisms about the presentation of this book is that it is fairly over-sized, but still a soft-cover, so it is easy to damage. Also, I had hoped it would contain more exercises for training novices in the use of colour and various paints, but I can see that that beginning painters are not necessarily its target audience. Overall, I loved the book, especially all the illustrations from the Dinotopia books, and I do recommend it to beginners and everybody else. By the way, the author also has an excellent and well-updated Youtube channel that takes this book further."

I’ve never seen a clearer or more thorough explanation of painting color and light. The passion Gurney has for picture-making made a big impression on me too. Reading this has reignited an excitement in observing the world around me and all the colors it has to offer. Biggest lessons were: the color of the atmospheric and light conditions are oftentimes the bigger factor than the local color of the object; color changes depending on what color it sits next to - pay attention to color relationships; everything on Gamut Maps (BRAND new concept to me - will have to start using this). Finally, I loved the theme of this whole book: that paintings are so special because it’s the one medium where we can visually show each other how we see the world."

This book can be for beginners but only if they’re committed and paint while reading it. I will definitely go back to Color and Light to read it again. One does not simply read this and is done.

Some things could be edited out and put together in my opinion. Also, Gurney said that because he would use his own paintings, he could talk about the thought process. Pity that thought process did not come up anymore after that promise. Lastly, just a small think but I am a bit disappointed in the phrase ‘Dutch landscape painters frequently used cloud shadows to add variety to otherwise dull, open expanses of farmland.’ (P.194) I hope Gurney will look more into Dutch landscape painting and its purposes en meanings before calling open farmland dull as a subject for landsape paintings ever again."

It doesn't give you point-by-point instructions on painting, but rather shows different problems that every artist will encounter. It helped me to notice these problems, understand their nature, and gave a perspective on how to think about solving them. I think I'm better equipped to take up a challenge and confidently play with light and color. It starts with generic, fundamental knowledge about different kinds of lighting and color theory that any beginner will appreciate. Gradually selected subjects, each of them beautifully illustrated, become more advanced and more specific. Maybe not all o them are applicable to every picture but if you happen to work on something peculiar, you'll have no problems finding the right reference in this book as it is structured very well. All of the insights, tips, and techniques are very pragmatic, based either on physics, psychology, or years of practice. They are described in a simple and accessible manner, without lyrical ""artsy"" language that likes to get loose with sense and meaning. While was rather universal in terms of medium, this book is heavily skewed toward painting. There are parts dedicated solely to pigments, paints, and mixing colors that won't be applicable to any other medium.

This is the top book in it's field for artists in every media. This is the gold standard. There simply is no more authoritative voice than Gurney's. He is related to Dan Gurney the great race car driver and that makes him one of the greatest living artist of our time. Racing and painting: it doesn't get any better than that at any end of the gene pool."

Every now and then you might need to go back and refresh the memory on the basics and this is the perfect book for that on this particular subject.

The words are easy to understand, the explanations are brief, like only the necessary points, along with tips and there's always pictures to pointed out the means. Most of it are about how color and light happened the way it happened in the nature and how to apply it in the painting. While I don't do (oil) painting, but I really enjoy the scientific explanations and the tips, and now I wish for updated/ extended version. Or maybe just a new book new topic altogether."

Gurney is a living legend for a reason. If you’re not a painter, but appreciate art, it’s still a great read. You will get a high-quality artbook of Gurney’s stunning artwork (it helps if you also like dinosaurs, although it’s not mandatory), and learn a lot more about how colour and light work in both nature and in art."

James Gurney describes different lighting conditions and settings in great detail, even if the different types of lighting are each explained in just a few pages. It’s become sort of a encyclopedia almost for me when I want to learn about a certain type of lighting quickly.

It covered so much about light and how you can use colour to achieve different light effects in your painting. This book has opened my eyes to many things I barely think about. I've seen a lot of artists recommend this book and I was sceptical about purchasing it, but I'm so glad I did. Highly recommend it to other artists, you would not be disappointed."

In the later half of chapters, it went into greater depth on some concepts that are beyond my ambition, so I think it would be great for people of intermediate skill as well. Where this book really excelled was using the author’s freaky dinosaur-world paintings to demonstrate each concept. Five stars."

The illustrations are enjoyable to look at. The author uses almost exclusively his own work. There are painting sketches from his plein air work and finished paintings from his work in Dinotopia. I waffled between 4 and 5 stars because I wasn’t absolutely enthralled with it. There was a lot of information I already knew. However, the things I knew but didn’t have a name for, outweighed what I came in with. It was an enjoyable read with fun pictures."

In History of Beauty, renowned author Umberto Eco sets out to demonstrate how every historical era has had its own ideas about eye-appeal. History of Beauty is really about the history of philosophical and perceptual notions of perfection and how they have been applied to ideas and objects, as well as to the human body. This survey ranges over such themes as the mathematics of ideal proportions, the problem of representing ugliness, the fascination of the exotic and art for art's sake. Along the way, the text examines the intersection of standards of beauty with Christian belief, notions of the Sublime, the philosophies of Kant and Hegel, and bourgeois culture. More than 300 illustrations trace the history of Western art as it relates, in the broadest sense, to the topic of beauty. تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و چهارم ماه ژوئن سال2012میلادی عنوان: تاریخ زیبایی: نظریه های زیبایی در فرهنگهای غربی؛ اثر: «اومبرتو اکو»؛ ترجمه و گزینش سرکار خانم: «هما بینا»؛ پیشگفتار و تحشیه جناب «جهانگیر شهدادی»؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، فرهنگستان هنر جمهوری اسلامی ایران، موسسه ی تالیف، ترجمه و نشر آثار هنری، سال1390، در230ص، مصور، بخشی رنگی، شابک9789642320844؛ کتابنامه ص223، همچنین به صورت زیرنویس، نمایه دارد، تاریخ زیبایی شناسی، هنر، فلسفه؛ از ترجمه انگلیسی به فارسی برگردانده شده است، موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایتالیا - سده20م فهرست: پیشگفتار؛ فصل اول «آرمان زیبایی شناسی: همسرایی موزها؛ تصویر هنرمند از زیبایی؛ زیبایی از دید فلاسفه»؛ فصل دوم «آپولونی و دیونوسیوسیی: خدایان دلفی؛ از یونان تا نیچه»؛ فصل سوم «زیبایی در قالب تناسب و هماهنگی: عدد و موسیقی؛ تناسب معمارانه؛ بدن انسان؛ جهات هستی و طبیعت؛ هنرهای دیگر؛ همخوانی با هدف؛ تناسب در گذر تاریخ»؛ فصل چهارم «نور و رنگ در قرون وسطا: نور و رنگ؛ خداوند به مثابه نور؛ نور، ثروت و فقر؛ تزیین؛ رنگ در شعر و عرفان؛ رنگ در زندگی روزمره؛نمادپردازی رنگ؛ اصحاب کلام و فلاسفه»؛ فصل پنجم «زیبایی هیولاها: تصویرپردازی زیبا از زشتی؛ موجودات افسانه ای و حیرت انگیز؛ زشتی در نمادپردازی جمعی؛ زشتی لازمه ی زیبایی؛ زشتی غرابتی طبیعی؛» فصل ششم «از شعر روستایی تا زن فرشته سان: عشق مقدس و عشق دنیوی؛ بانوان و شاعران دوره گرد؛ بانوان و شوالیه ها؛ شاعران و عشقهای ناممکن»؛ فصل هفتم «زیبایی سحرآمیزاز سده پانزدهم تا شانزدهم: زیبایی میان ابداع و تقلید طبیعت؛ شبیه سازی؛ زیبایی ماورای محسوسات؛ ونوسها»؛ فصل هشتم «بانوان و قهرمانان: بانوان؛ قهرمانان؛ زیبایی کاربردی؛ و زیبایی نفسانی»؛ فصل نهم «از ملاحت تا زیبایی ناآرام: منریسم؛ بحران دانش؛ اندوه؛ فراست ظرافت جمع، استعاره های غریب؛ تمایل به دستیابی به قدرت»؛ فصل دهم «استدلال و زیبایی: دیالکتیک زیبایی؛ انظباط و آزادیخواهی؛ کاخها و باغها؛ کاسیسم و نئوکلاسیسم؛ قهرمانان پیکرها ویرانه ها؛ اندیشه های نو مضامین نو؛ زن و اشتیاق؛ بازی آزاد زیبایی؛ زیبایی ظالم و محزون»؛ فصل یازدهم «امر شکوهمند: مفهومی جدید از زیبایی؛ امر شکوهمند پژواک روحی متعالی است؛ امر شکوهمند در طبیعت؛ جنبه های شاعرانه ی ویرانه ها؛ شیوه گوتیک در ادبیات؛ ادموند برک؛ امر شکوهمند از دید کانت»؛ فصل دوازدهم زیبایی رمانتیک: زیبایی رمانتیک؛ زیبایی رمانتیک و زیبایی عشقهای پرماجرای قدیمی؛ زیبایی مبهم نمیدانم چطور؟؛ رمانتیسم و عصیان؛ حقیقت اسطوره و کنایه؛ محزون، گروتسک و اندهبار؛ رمانیسم شاعرانه؛ فصل سیزدهم «کیش زیبایی: کیش زیبایی شناسی؛ دندییسم؛ جسم مرگ و ابلیس؛ هنر برای هنر؛ خلاف جهت رگه ها؛ سمبولیسم (نمادگرایی)؛ عرفان زیبایی شناسانه؛ جذبه درون همه چیز؛ امپرسیونیسم؛»؛ فصل چهاردهم «شیء جدید: زیبای منسجم دوره ویکتوریا؛ آهن و شیشه، زیبایی جدید؛ از آرنوو تا آردکو؛ زیبایی ارگانیک؛ کالاهای روزمره، انتقاد تجاری شدن، تولید انبوه؛»؛ فصل پانزدهم «زیبایی ماشین آلات: ماشین آلات زیبا؛ از دوره باستان تا قرون وسطی؛ از قرن پانزدهم تا دوره باروک؛ سده های هجدهم و نوزدهم؛ قرن بیستم»؛ فصل شانزدهم: «از فرمهای انتزاعی تا اعماق مواد: در سنگها مجسمه هایش را جستجو کن؛ ارزشیابی دوباره مواد در دوران معاصر؛ حاصر آماده ها؛ از دوباره سازی تا مواد صنعتی اعماق مواد»؛ فصل هفدهم «زیبایی رسانه ها: زیبایی تحریک آمیز یا زیبایی مصرفی؟؛ هنر پیشتاز یا زیبایی تحریک آمیز؛ زیبایی مصرفی»؛ درباره نویسنده «اومبرتو اکو»؛ کتابشناسی؛ نمایه؛ انگار کردم در کلاس درس زیبایی در دانشگاه بنشسته ام، درباره ی سیر نگاه‌های گفتنی از زیبایی، و سلیقه ها در تاریخ هست؛ فصلهایی که خود «امبرکو اکو» نگاشته اند، کلاس درس است تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/03/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 16/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Reading Eco’s study On Beauty feels like visiting a Temple with very many chambers. In each room there are texts. There are also images, many of them too and of good quality and they are all photos of art pieces. During this visit we are accompanied by the talk of a commentator. He comments on the texts only. Not on the images. Each room corresponds to a period in the Quest of Beauty. In this pursuit we can also conceive each space as forming a petal of a different tone and shape, so that by the end of the journey we can see that this Temple has the appearance of a multi-faceted flower. And a beautiful flower it is. In the search for Beauty along Western history many questions have been raised. Where does Beauty originate? Is it in the things? And therefore is it made by man, or is it in Nature and made by god? If a god creates beauty, then what is this god? A concept, like Goodness? Or is it a being? If so, then what was his purpose? Or could man create it not in the things but out of the things? Who is this man (mostly man, sometimes woman) and what is his nature? Are all men capable of creating Beauty? Or is it only some – those who are endowed with a (divine) capacity, and we can call them ‘artists’? And those are the Artists – the beings who can create a (divine) entity – ‘art’? Or is beauty really created by the subject? Is it in front of you or is it in your eye – the shifting eye of the beholder? Can Beauty be measured? Indeed, is it proportion itself? Who measures those proportions? Does it form part of an overall scheme of things, the Harmonic Tutto? Or does it require another quality, such as individuality, and should therefore break the norms and surprise? What is its purpose? To elevate us to a higher, and ethical, or to a sublime realm? And if related to the human, should it be sensual, or smart, or witty? Does it have a gender? Or does it belong to the dominion of a particular gender? To what extent is it relative and needs its own context to shine out. These are many of the questions addressed by Eco as they were formulated by thinkers, and it is his anthology of texts, from Theognis and Plato to critics from the 1950s, going through Plotinus, Suger, Hildegard von Bingen, Dante, Alberti, Gracián, Hume, Kant, Goethe, Diderot, Baudelaire, Foscolo, Burke, Wilde, Pater, Duchamp amongst very many others, that form the backbone of this book. The copious and beautiful images are unconnected illustrations. They are not addressed by Eco nor specifically related to the selected texts. They form a background musing, colouring the excerpts, like in my review. For the book is conceived as an intellectual exercise, an examination of concepts. It is a theoretical flower then, even if the images add a veneer by appealing to a seen and experienced Beauty. Reading the compendium of excerpts, however, is somewhat unsatisfying and one feels that in this Temple one is just looking at the spine of the books stored in those inviting chambers. But they serve as indications for a later trip, without commentator, when one can stay in one of those rooms and think, not contemplate, some of those notions. And as map of the Search of Beauty this book is excellent."
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Really a 3 1/2 star book, but since that's not an option... This book is misnamed, really ""dictionary of Beauty"" would be a closer title, while ""Umberto Eco's Musings on Beauty in a loosely chronological order with occasionaly quotes about beauty from other thinkers and a boatload of pictures"" would probably hit closest to home. Undoubtedly the publisher shot that title down and stuck in its place. Strengths: Each individual section is fairly informative and interesting to read. There are a lot of useful and interesting art prints, quotes that I likely would never otherwise have encountered, and thoughtful reflections on the various periods and thinkers of artistic history. I will definitely be returning to the needed sections (particularly those on the Middle Ages and the modern world) for review in the future. And if nothing else, it is encouraging to see a major modern thinker engaging aesthetics. That is rare enough to be worthy of attention and time. Weaknesses: This book has two major weaknesses, the first is editing. This is always a fairly irritating one for me, since it means that either the author or the publisher or both (possibly also the translator in this case) got lazy along the way and just didn't do their job well. If I'm going to give money and time to your creative work, you should at least have the decency to care about keeping it coherent. The second is that there's really no overall theme. Which is (spoiler alert- though it's nonfiction so I doubt anyone actually cares) one of the points he makes about Beauty, that it is no consistent through time. People's and cultures' perceptions of Beauty shift and grow and change from year to year, and region to region. Therefore, he argues, there is no (perhaps there cannot even be) any solid and lasting definition of Beauty. Beauty at the end of the day is relative, despite his claim that it is pervasive throughout both our culture and cultures past. Which functionally turns this into a 400 page episode of . Not that it's funny, but that it's a book about nothing. Or at least, nothing that has any transcendent value. If there is no ultimate Beauty, and it's all relative, why should we be bothered to read a book about it? Well, as I said above, it worth reading. But it would be more worth reading if Eco had articulated his own philosophy of Beauty and then talked about it in the context of aesthetics through history. In his failure to do so, this book is ultimately yet another postmodern disappointment."

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Even if I agree with most of the reproaches this book received (that it is more a guide than a study, that it is more a triumph of compression than of clarity, that it is too eclectic and so on) I have to say I really enjoyed it. Is this a consequence of my great admiration for Umberto Eco or of my art dilettantism , I'm not sure (and I won't dig, so back off!). Anyway, I think the author completed his objectives, enumerated in Introduction: - to identify Beauty as a thing worth to be contemplated independently of the desire we may feel for it; -to establish the relationship between Beauty and Art (since Beauty was sometimes perceived simply as a quality of Nature); - to document the history of Beauty (only in Western culture, though) through art (because only the artists left examples) but not to write a history of art. Based on a reviewing of the great artistic movements (whose ideologies influenced - evidently- the conception of Beauty), the essay presents different Aesthetic Ideals from ancient Greece to nowadays, emphasizing the growing complexity of the concept of Beauty, from the antithesis Apollonian - Dionysiac as a very interesting antithesis between vision and sound, to the contemporary syncretism, from Pythagoras' abstract numbers and music of spheres to the prosaic industrialization, from Pericles' ideal of harmony, order, measure, and simplicity, to ""the orgy of tolerance, the total syncretism and the absolute and unstoppable polytheism of Beauty"" which characterize our times. On the other hand, I was amused to learn that Thomas Aquinas considered a crystal hammer ugly because it didn't serve a purpose and that Marco Polo, seeing rhinoceros for the first time thought they were unicorns (I bet Eugène Ionesco didn't know that!). Overall, not pretentious, beautifully illustrated (someone said, ironically, of course, that it would make a wonderful present), it doesn't aim to impress but to observe the evolution of a concept over a very long period of time. Hence the impression that he only grazed the surface of the subject."
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is more source-book than analytical history and while there's no doubting Eco's erudition, all that's really on display here is his ability to summarise and compress vast swathes of literature into a handful of paragraphs : {whisper} this is pretty shallow and superficial, and anyone with an informed view of intellectual history won't learn anything new. What is valuable is the way Eco has effectively curated texts, both visual and literary, and the surprising beauty category tables at the front that throw up unpredictable groupings and interconnections. There's surprisingly little actual commentary from Eco: instead he assumes the artworks and extracts will speak for themselves, even though connections between image and text is often arbitrary. That said, as a compendium of texts related to aesthetics, even if only extracts, this can't help but be useful. It would have been nice to have had more Eco - and the illustrations are lavish and gorgeous. An enhanced coffee-table book I'd say."

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It's an interesting topic: what is beauty? It might seem like a trivial question, but think about it: esthetics run through everything we do. Everything we read, watch, listen to, right down to the houses we live in, the cars we drive, the cans we buy food in are made to correspond to some standard of beauty. Where does all that come from? What makes us think a Rolls looks better than a Datsun? What makes Dickens a better writer than Stephenie Meyer? Why did medieaval Christ figures look triumphant and baroque ones suffering? Why is Kate Moss a supermodel and Roseanne Barr not? Can something tragic be beautiful? If you've read Eco before you know he's good at picking up patterns, memes, ideas and how they mutate with time and context. So this is Eco the non-fiction writer tracing society's concept of beauty from pre-historic time to the 21st century, richly illustrated with artworks and architecture and quotes from poets, philosophers and novelists ranging from Plato to Wilde. Venus of Willendorf and Naomi Campbell, Apollo and George Clooney, Warhol and Tizian, Thomas Aquinus and Kafka, they're all in here. Inevitably, even at 400 pages, it becomes a bit of a coffee table book; it's a huge topic, and he doesn't really have time to cover everything (plus, it's all pretty Eurocentric, of course). But being Eco, what he does cover is covered in-depth, giving you a great understanding of how and why standards change and how they relate to changes in the world - the relationships between religion and art, between revolution and poetry, technology and design. Rather brilliant. Plus, obviously, the book itself is beautiful. Now I'm even more intrigued by the sequel On Ugliness; Eco has said that after writing the first book, he realised he'd been writing about standards, about conformity. What about the things that don't conform to the traditional standards? That's another doorstopper."

I have to question the degree to which Eco ascribes the concept of “beauty” being informed by a specific epistemological zeitgeist (e.g. the dethroning of the Church as ultimate authority being reflected in the shadowy aesthetics of the Baroque), and some of his semiotic conclusions seem like stretches. However, that wart aside, it's a gorgeous exposition of how we got to what Eco calls the “aesthetic polytheism” of the present (great term)."

The concept is quite easy: each chapter contains a short description of the period in question and its understanding of beauty, accompanied by important artworks and literature of the time. These chapters are often just 3-5 pages. Nevertheless it's hard to read (weird layout, at least in the german edition, and hard to understand texts without comments) and boring at times. It doesn't feel like a cohesive book, but rather like lecture notes put together. Period descriptions don't go into details, but mention what's most important.

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The book originally was presented as a CD-Rom. Although I like books, I think the idea of the writer would be better experienced in an interactive webpage or digital media. Because a page limits you to what is in it or its neighbours, or a shorter or longer search for a glimpsed idea. Hyperlink and search functions really help to compare what is in common and to spot the differences. The book deals with the idea of beauty, and how it has changed through time and cultures, using works of art as the only surviving yardstick of what was considered beautiful. Although the author has his own views, he tries to keep it hidden, focusing instead on what others thought, although the narrative gives a hint of which of those ideas he favors, sometimes quite broadly, but that is to be expected as he is a son of his own time and culture, so his views will be different (though still close) from mine. Its awkward handling, specially as it requires a certain level of involvement from the reader give it this relatively low score for such a gorgeous book. Because it is gorgeous, and a simple cursory read, looking at the images, probably will enlighten you as much as deep reading. But that gorgeousness detracts from its own message, because subject to so many beautiful images, how can you define what is beauty, if beauty is most of them? Which I suppose goes a long way to explain why Eco published also History of Ugliness. Because you cannot have one without the other. Maybe after reading it my mind will clear, and I will give it a higher score."

Often in books, illustrations are used to bolster the text, it's vice versa here! The text content deals with the idea and evolution of what we consider as ""Beauty"".

Illustrations of paintings, architecture, human body, fashion. 2. The part on Cosmos (personal bias) 3. Small commentary and anecdotes to support the illustrations. 4. Crash course on popular paintings. My ignorance was withered away for quite a few famous artists - prominent example being Bosch's Garden of Earthly delights - Paradise and Hell. 1. Most of the artists and their works were Greek to me. Being a novice, i couldn't appreciate the identity or magnitude of those artists and their paintings. Only a fraction of names were familiar - Dante, Bellini, Leonardo. While it widened the horizon, looking up too many references killed the fun. I'm sure an art student would appreciate it better.

The book also contains hundreds of extracts from a wide range of writers including Sappho, Plato, Hildegard of Bingen, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe and Wilde. Although these extracts were interesting, they were perhaps too short: it was difficult to appreciate these brief snippets of philosophical writings, treatises on perspective, novels, plays, poems and other works. Frustratingly, these excerpts also frequently split the main body of the text mid-sentence.

It's just another collection of selected paragraphs and quotes from historical and philosophical essays concerning Beauty and other aesthetical categories like the Picturesque or the Sublime, with some extra explanations. I expected it to be a new essay by Mr. Eco himself, but his presence and touch on the subject approached is almost inexistent or unnoticeable. Plus, a quite expensive book. So, if you're already into History of Art or Philosophy, don't even think about getting this book.

Though I read the book and made an honest attempt to absorb a goodly amount of the information, I suspect that I missed entire theses in my reading. One reason is that the writing in supported with both images and text. Before I began the book I thought it was mostly an art historical history of beauty. I didn't realize how great a role writing, especially poetry and philosophy, would play in the theories expressed and discussed in the book. I am an artist and art instructor, but my grounding in philosophy is mediocre and my poetry background is almost nil. I was much better able to understand the arguments and explanations when they referred to art images (those included in the book or those left out) than when they were supported by poetry, philosophy, literature or music. The writing is very academic and the book is full of both quality color reproductions of artworks and excerpts from many many written works. In the written works context was sometimes limited and this added to my feeling of being lost or confused. I would expect the book to be used more as a textbook--a graduate level textbook supported by other text, readings and discussions. This is not a light read."

True, Eco's main point is that there is not necessarily a theme to beauty, but this nonetheless made it a tougher read. The included philosophic tidbits were great and well selected, though I felt some added context would have helped overall. The images chosen were great, and almost always helped in understanding the ideas being presented.

Not only is it not a ""study"", but it can feel rather fragmented and incoherent throughout. Eco and De Michele seem to intend this book to serve as ""a history"" of beauty rather than ""the history"", if one exists at all—it reads most like the textbook for an introductory survey course in art history/aesthetics. I think this book does a decent job at striking the balance between a somewhat in-depth, insightful look into the subject matter and an accessible read geared toward those of us who are not experts equipped with the right kind of academic jargon. With that said, however, it clearly suffers from a number of nebulous patches—like questionable editorial decisions, occasionally unclear translations, and, most importantly, a marketing attempt to underscore editor Umberto Eco's name. It would actually fare decently well had it not attempted to rely on Eco's namesake, thus inviting ridiculously high expectations from the reader. A closer look at the first few pages of the book (which offer some words about how this book came together) is advised. Last, but not least... This book might not be for you if you have a thing against the ""arts"" that don't conform to the post-Classical era high art ideal. Said notion about what constitutes good art (if any) and beauty had its place at a particular moment in history, but it's not all there is to it. Particularly, I've read a number of reviewers here and elsewhere that appeared to have issues with parts of this book in which the authors delve into the ""beauty of the [mass] media"", possibly founded upon the notion that the popular art that serves commercial and/or political ends just isn't (and shouldn't be) on the same level as the Great Masterpieces. I would offer my view that all art was/is popular art, and it's our decision to or not to put something above something else, or to place it on a pedestal and regard it as a timeless classic. But that's not what this review is about. In short: It's an okay read. By all means, go for it—but know what you're really getting yourself into, and don't be surprised if something comes up that differs from your own ideas."

The scholarship by Eco is very good and the book has a lot of illustrations and primary sources to back his claims (although for the 20th century there is a lack of texts). I must just warn that the stirrups didn't reach Europe in the High Middle Ages, but instead was already around in the late 6th and early 7th centuries (depending on the region) probably due to Avar influence. I also don't agree with the assertion by Eco his work is relativistic because the fact the idea of Beauty changed many times by itself doesn't mean by itself it's relativistic in any way. My only great issue with this book is that the editing was bad and there wasn't a proof read (for instance, the dates of some art works were wrong or the descriptions were exchanged, especially in the initial pages). Finally, unlike what some people say, this isn't properly a work of Art History (because it's goal isn't art in itself, although beauty is highly related to it and this is useful for art historians), but instead of semiotics (more specifically of semantics, as the perceptions of Beauty in the ""western world"" since Ancient Greece are discussed)."

A couple of qualifications: 1. He is obviously most concerned with literary and fine arts, mostly ignoring decorative arts, architecture, performing arts, etc. 2. He leans heavily on literary and artistic figures probably less well-known outside Eco's native Italy. 3. His analysis tends to begin somewhat abstruse in the early chapters and really becomes engaging around the Renaissance and Enlightenment. (e.g. His observations about dandyism really connected a razor-sharp line from Oscar Wilde to handlebar-moustachioed hipsters, the self as raw material and artwork.) But as an introductory text demonstrating the visual arts over recorded history, it's an admirable survey with several excellent insights."

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"History of Beauty by Umberto Eco Umberto Eco is notorious as the Italian professor of semiotics who wrote a bestseller, The Name of the Rose, which sparked off a host of imitators and invigorated interest in the study of medieval art and culture. In addition to all that, he has been an editor in TV and publishing, a columnist for an avant garde monthly, and a prolific essayist. If there is such a thing as a renaissance man, Eco is it. On Beauty is an encyclopedia of images and ideas about beauty ranging from ancient Greece to the present day. It begins with 20 pages of reproductions of paintings and photographs, representing an enormous range of cultural icons, from Bronzini's Allegory of Venus to characteristic snapshots of David Beckham and George Clooney. More paintings decorate the next 400 pages of quotations from philosophers and writers - Plato, Boccaccio, San Bernardo. Kant, Heine, et al. The book is arranged according to various themes rather than chronologically, although, given the fact that it begins with the aesthetic ideals of ancient Greece and ends with pop art and the mass media, the chronology seems self-evident. On the other hand, as Eco points out in his introduction, ""this is a history of Beauty and not a history of art (or of literature or music)"". He goes on to ask the obvious question - ""why is this history of Beauty documented solely through works of art?"" - and he replies by claiming that ""over the centuries it was artists, poets, and novelists who told us about the things they considered beautiful and they were the ones who left us examples. Peasants, masons, bakers or tailors also made things that they probably saw as beautiful, but only a very few of these artefacts remain."" This is an answer which seems surprisingly unimaginative for a polymath of Eco's acumen, if only because it provokes a great many more questions about the book's structure and content. The introduction concludes that ""Beauty has never been absolute and immutable but has taken on different aspects depending on the historical period and the country"" - beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Having read this, I found myself wondering why the book confines itself to examples of beauty from western Europe and the iconography of Hollywood movies. On this evidence the populations of Russia, the Middle East, China, India, Japan, Africa and South America have had no concepts of beauty or at least no artefacts worthy of display, and while it is reasonable to suppose that the scope of On Beauty 's illustrations is the product of individual taste, their limitations seem to be defying the main thrust of its argument. As a result, although we've been told with some force that this is a history of beauty, rather than art, it reads very much like an eclectic primer of western aesthetics and painting. This impression is reinforced by Eco's assertion of an essential ""link between art and beauty"". It seems a curious claim after a century in which artists struggled to reject precisely this link between themselves and Renaissance beliefs. (The ""new realist"" painter Fernand Léger, for instance, lecturing in the 1930s, argued that art was actually a barrier between the people and ""the domain of the beautiful"".) The problem is highlighted in the chapters on ""monstrosities"", and ""ugliness"". Eco describes the medieval fascination with representations of devilish monsters and the pangs of hellfire, and argues that centuries of aesthetic theory presented ugliness as the antithesis of beauty, that the moral significance of ugliness lies in being a fundamental strand of a complex universe. One revealing aspect of these arguments is that they are the product of a view from the centre of a traditional European cosmos, and it's hard to imagine what the notion of monstrosity might mean were it to be tested against the background of a nonEuropean universe. But it's not only in the world outside Europe that definitions of this kind begin to lose their force and meaning. In a European environment ruled by a polymorphous clutch of moral and religious rubrics, a large proportion of the population continues, for reasons which are essentially mysterious, to be fascinated by phenomena that are grotesque, monstrous or downright disgusting. The contemplation of medieval monstrosities can, no doubt, be paralleled by the popularity of Victorian freak shows, or, in the present day, our delight in the varieties of horror peddled through the cinema, TV and the computer screen. From a contemporary standpoint, our fascination with fabulous monsters has now been divorced from morality, religious awe or even curiosity, and the underlying aesthetic is more to do with pure sensation. The Renaissance invention of ugliness, therefore, can no longer stand in support of the category beauty. For a large swath of contemporary practitioners, also, the idea of a beautiful representation is part of an aesthetic ideal which the American painter Barnett Newman described as ""the bugbear of European art"". On Beauty avoids discussing these contradictions, and the consequence is a beautifully produced guidebook to the classical and Renaissance practice that linked together ideas about art and beauty. The promise of Eco's introduction, however, never comes near fulfilment, and there's a curious sense that the book's editor was only half involved, that the assembly of the various elements took place on different sites and drew on different traditions. On the other hand, maybe that is the logic of Eco's Renaissance-inflected sensibility. When he's experimenting, trying to break new ground, the result can be a brilliant synthesis; when he's recycling orthodoxies, as he is here, you get an incoherent hotch-potch of elements - a bit of a fudge.

A book to leave around the house to crack open at random places - ooh! pretty pictures! And some interesting lines. Liked the last few chapters the best. Of most interest to me: The beauty of machines The beauty of the Media The beauty of Consumption sort of colliding and crashing and caving in to the beauty of provocation.

It ends with this great statement, ""Our explorer from the future will no longer be able to identify the aesthetic ideal diffused by the mass media of the twentieth century and beyond.

Some entries on disgust, which were unexpected. Neoclassical and classical beauty were all mentioned. The sublime is standard entry. What I'd like to know more is Eco's view/views on beauty. Though he has indicated this is a compendium about beauty, I'd like to know more about his own views on the matter. He's a ruffian hard to pin down, like that. Personally, my views on beauty are Thomistic. As Aquinas wrote, paraphrasing, it is about all things in their right proportion. And it is God, who has all things in His mind, who has the measure on all things. Know God and know the beauty of things being in their right order. This also helps me to explain why we have disgust; it is simply not proportional. Now, I know why this may not sit will with a postmodern mind. My question to stir the waters now. Can the ugly be redeemed to become beautiful? I think it can. It's what we Christians are called to do after our Lord Jesus desired this for our very selves. The ugly made beautiful. God bless"

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"My first glimpse of this title came at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2010. The edition exhibited was in the original Italian and significantly more handsome than the translated library copy I have been perusing this past week. I was reminded of my desire to read it by the recent report of Umberto Eco's death and ordered it at my local library thinking a read of it as good a way to honour and memorialize this pertinacious scholar as any. I collected the book from the library en route to a lunch date with an old friend. I came to regret this as I was already carrying my own book to show her over lunch and the Eco volume was extraordinarily heavy. As each spread contains full-colour illustrations the publisher (Rizzoli) has printed the whole book on very heavy (probably 70 pound), coated paper. Initially I didn't think much of it, especially since I was expecting more of a philosophical tractate of beauty (yes, in spite of the title) rather than a simple timeline of different artistic expressions of the concept through the ages. I also thought the exclusive focus on art limited and skewed the project, as beauty is not (necessarily) synonymous with art, either now or ever. It seemed for the most part as if the book could just as accurately have been titled 'History of Art' or at least 'History of Beauty in Art'. The original Italian title also features the word 'occidental' which I would have liked retained in the English title, as no other beauty ideals were treated other than Western ones, which as we know are significantly at odds with other ideals around the world. All this being said, I warmed to the book, its format and its purpose, as I read the little mini-essays (each sub-chapter no more than a page or two of text), and enjoyed the images, many of which I was already familiar with, but - refreshingly - some that I was not. All in all, I would say that while this is neither a deep nor terribly original work, it is a beautiful object in its own right, and well worth gambolling through."

I did not have a problem with this western view point when I read the book. I thought that Eco’s analysis was informative an interesting.

I did, however, gain much from the book just by looking at the pictures (which comprise ~70% of the book) and reading the associated captions; the organization of the book into chronological order traces the artistic expression of beauty from pre-history to modern pop culture and includes so many beautiful color plates by way of illustrative example. Its main shortcoming – and it's a big one – is its nearly total, exclusive focus on the Western concept of beauty, and the resultant drawings, paintings, etc. thereof. There is only token discussion and representation of large, long-lasting, and/or strongly inon-Western cultures, including those of Africa, indigenous populations of Western countries (such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia), India, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands. and Latin America.

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On Beauty - A History of a Western Idea Eco, Umberto Seeker & Warburg, 2004 Now, during the times of the Coronavirus 19, I have the time to read and write on Eco’s work on Beauty. When I think on my feeling of Beauty, I feel about how you feel for your family (my parents, my wife, my sons, our grandson!), or my perception of nature, or the work I have been doing myself or the one coming from other friends. It could be watching some films or videos, reading some books or articles, painting, drawing, writing, singing, composing, or farming. There are many sources on how I feel Beauty. Eco’s book has 17 chapters, which means that he makes a thorough and deep analysis of Beauty. In the introduction he makes the distinction (or association ?) between Beauty and those elements we like, or that we would like to possess. The book explores Beauty over the centuries; relation between Beauty and Art; existing documentation; relations with different individuals/authorities . We find a good introduction with the pictures presented on: Venus nude (13th century BC), Adonis nude (6th BC), Venus clothed, Adonis clothed, portraits, Madonna, Jesus, Kings, Queens, and proportions. The 1st chapter goes into The Aesthetic Ideal in Ancient Greece. The chorus of the muses sing to Hesiod in Thebes: the most beautiful is the most just. Just means symmetry, harmony, moderation. Helen is beauty. The beauty delights the senses. We can find also the Artist’s idea of beauty: the subjective idea becomes important. Beauty could be the synthesis of living bodies. For the philosophers it could be something different: we could see Xenophon’s Memorabilia: Ideal, Spiritual and Useful (functional). Chapter II takes us into the Apollonian (Nietzsche / read Homer) and Dionysiac beauty. Two antithetical divinities take presence. Chaos coming into the beauty of harmony. Different types of art assume the contact (or the distance!) from the observer to the work of art. Beauty could also be understood as proportion and harmony (Chapter III): “the idea of passing from the arithmetical concept of number to the spatio-geometrical concept of the ratios between a variety of points is a Pythagorean concept”.64 Normally both concepts are present and they express proportion and symmetry (see Canon in statues from Policlitus, siglo IV a.C). Apparently it is expressed in cosmos and nature. The correct relationships changed with time. In Renaissance, this changed and it became more a torsion, outside of the mathematical rules that govern the physical world. It became interesting to read in chapter IV how since the Middle Ages thinkers and philosophers gave their criteria for anything to be beautiful: claritas and luminosity (Thomas Aquinas in Summa Theologiae, 1250); Marco Polo after visiting the Great Kaan’s Palace); Pliny indicating how black, white and red are the principal colours; from the twelfth century onwards, blue dominated because it allowed the ‘celestial’ light to come in; how Dante Alighieri uses it in Paradiso, when Divine light comes in. Monsters and ugliness helped to define beauty since quite early: Gorgon’s head, hell, earthly delights, dragons, mappa mundi, fauns, androgynies. They became important elements in universal symbolism, morality, hypocrisy, as shown in Hieronymus Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights. Donnas Angelicatas became important, as we can hear in Carmina Burana; ladies and knights; impossible loves. The Raft of the Medusa, from Theodore Géricault is a good example. And it is a divine thing To love, to be able To invent a queen However illusory… Only the dream is our concern, And without it, all things cease. I love the distant prince! (Carducci Giosue, Jaufré Rudel, 1888) Magic beauty can be found in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: Da Vinci’s concept that “The painter is a master of all the things that may come to man’s mind”. Plotinus (third century, Enneads, V,8) would say that “In truth there is no beauty more authentic than the wisdom we find and love in some individual. He would say that “This discourse is not aimed at all people; but should you to see yourself as beautiful, remember it”. Correspondence between Macrocosm and Microcosm. During the Renaissance, the Grand Theory led to the discovery of harmonies more complex and disturbing than foreseen. Mannerism (thinly veiled conflict within the soul) appears. Copernican revolution: “everything concurred in reinforcing the discovery that the universe had not been specifically tailored for humanity, and that man was neither its artifice, nor its master”. 225 In 1761, Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that “good is none other than beauty in action”. 237 Specific discoveries defined craze for the Antique. In 1758 Hume, in his Subjectivism wrote that “beauty is no quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them”. 247 Types of beauty have been defined in relation with specific political regimes. Importance of the experience of the Sublime and its many definitions (Kant, Burke, Schiller, Nature, etc). It was my discovery to find the relation between beauty and Dandyism, with dandies being homosexual. According to Flaubert, “the predominant feature is the cult of the word, the ‘right word’, which can only confer harmony, an absolute necessity to the page.”339 Finally, it was great to read about the power of beauty and symbolism, the relation it had/has with machines, mathematics (Mandelbrot), and … with the media as we are now experimenting it with the social networks, fashion firms and the needs felt by the individual of keeping the pace!

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Umberto Eco was a semiotician, philosopher, specialist in the Middle Ages, literary critic, and Italian novelist. After receiving a doctorate at the University of Turin, Eco taught at the universities of Milan, Florence, Bologna, and the Collège de France. Umberto Eco is best known as a novelist. While he is primarily a semiotician and philosopher and has written only seven novels against more than 40 scientific books and hundreds of articles, he was considered one of the most important and prolific thinkers and intellectuals of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. And he was among the most important structuralist linguists and semioticians. The book History of Beauty is the first pioneering and highly praised picture book of Umberto Eco. It has been a great success since its first publication in 2004. What is beauty? Umberto Eco, one of the best and most important contemporary thinkers in Italy, examines the nature of meaning and the history of the idea of beauty in Western culture. The text is deep and elegant with many examples of excellent paintings and sculptures and long quotes from writers and Philosophers is illustrated in a luxurious and attractive way. This book is a beautiful history book that makes this intellectual and philosophical journey with one of the world's most admired thinkers available in a more compact and affordable format than history. It is art and not the history of aesthetics, but Umberto Eco uses the history of both disciplines to define the ideas of beauty that have shaped feeling from the classical world to the modern era. The History of Beauty is an illustrated book that explores the meaning of nature and the history of the idea of beauty in Western culture. This book is full of examples of famous paintings and sculptures from different eras and artistic styles. In fact, the book on the history of beauty provides us with a philosophical and artistic history of the concept of beauty, or rather, this book is a kind of intellectual and philosophical adventure around the idea of beauty. In order to provide a broad understanding of the concept of beauty, Umberto Eco starts his adventure from ancient Greece and examines beauty in later periods such as the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Age of Enlightenment, Romanticism, the Industrial Age, and contemporary art. Studying the book on the history of beauty will help you to stop being bound by common stereotypes about beauty and to know that beauty has variable meanings and criteria. What do you think the word ""beauty"" means? In the carvings on the walls of ancient caves or today's amazingly complex electronic devices? Natural wonders or classical works of art? Colorful insects or endless starry sky? Magnificent cathedral sculptures or oil paintings sold at auctions for astronomical prices? In the role of Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie Titanic or in a poster of Marilyn Monroe? The book of beautiful history was born from these questions. It must be said that humans have been in search of beauty since the beginning of civilization. We have followed aesthetics since ancient Greece and have been trying to define it; But the definition of beauty is constantly changing and volatile. Maybe this is why each person defines beauty in their own way. It is possible that the definition of painters or sculptors of beauty is different from the definition of writers and poets, and each of them recognizes a type of beauty. For example, the concept of female beauty praised in ancient Greek poetry may have been considered popular and normal at that time. But centuries later, painters and sculptors took advantage of it in a different way and turned it into a special subject. An object that is considered beautiful in one culture may not be attractive in another culture. So, what exactly does beauty mean? The summary of the book History of Beauty will tell us the answer. The one whom the Cambridge History of Italian Literature has identified as the leading Italian writer of the second half of the 20th century. During his life, he wrote more than 140 books in various fields. In the history of beauty, Eco has avoided arguments based on a single theory of beauty. Instead, he takes us into the vast world of philosophical ideas and works of art that have been considered beautiful over thousands of years, providing a clear account of the Western history of beauty. The main concepts of this book can be divided into 4 parts: Beauty in the classical era Beauty from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance Romantic beauty and intellectual beauty Beauty in the industrial age."

Firstly, because of the physical reasons - it is quite heavy (for such a small format) and it really made my wrists ache (lol). Also trying to read the small font of the (many) quotes in pale blue-ish colour was tiring (especially in the evenings, when the whiteness of the page and pale colour of the quotes melted together). from the ""one of the finest living authors"" (although, in 2021, he is not among living anymore; quote taken from the book's flaps)... I had a constant feeling that I missed some lectures and now I am reading slides from the presentation - written in an overly sophisticated vocabulary. And I also had that other feeling, a bit bizarre, that maybe I should have paid more attention during previous imagined lectures, because the issues/matters mentioned in this lecture are somehow brief and I am not familiar with some of the references. Or maybe I have ended up at some more advanced class that I didn't sign up for?! 😨 Jokes aside, this book marks certain social and art phenomena in time and space, but I would say I learned as much during my high school years. It is necessary to have some idea about art & trends in art to read ""History of Beauty"" with some understanding, but the book doesn't give much in return. In my case, it prompts me to look further for a more detailed, less summary-like position. After it makes me wonder, how many female artists (when one was even allowed to be one, considering the strict societal norms and laws that excluded women even from universities) ended in obscurity, and how the world was literally constructed by men. ""Funny"" thing - the only female artist's name mentioned in this book was ""Virginia Woolf"" (as one of the cultural examples of contribution to ""demolition of a canon of the Victorian period"")."

On the positive side: - my edition was lavishly illustrated and it was pleasurable to see so many beautiful objects of art - the main text developed a well-argued history of what was considered beautiful throughout history, also to explain how something considered beautiful 500 years ago might not be so appreciated in another historical period - besides dwelling in art, beauty was evaluated also through poetry, philosophy, and literature so that the reader can see how is influenced in such a way that there isn't much personal taste On the negative side: - the fragmentation of the text, interspersed with countless excerpts from literature, does not make for ease or fluidity of reading - I got so distracted by reading the main text and the excerpts that at times I lost sight of what the point of the chapter was Finally, some readers seem not to have understood that the point of the book is not what Eco considered beautiful (to which there was some disagreement) but to describe what was considered beautiful throughout the centuries, proved by images and text of the times. You may not agree with the Twelfth century's idea of beauty but it was what it was and isn't going to change to suit your taste. Finally, the disheartening end is that in the last decades the concept of beauty is so deteriorated and reduced to a commodity that everything (herefore nothing) can claim to be beautiful when we are actually living in one of the ugliest and least appealing periods of time.

BUT be careful! This is the SAME BOOK as another listed by Eco called HISTORY OF BEAUTY. I ended up buying both....and now someone is going to get a really great Christmas book! If you like this book, be sure to read Eco's companion volume ON UGLINESS. I ran across that one on a rainy day at the Morgan Library and Museum book shop. Both will make you think about these important concepts.I try to convince myself that I like Umberto Ecco's books. It is a personal obsession. Despite it, I have managed to only like the Name of the Rose. His books highly educated to me, but at the same time read quite densly. This is, again, a personal opinion. If you are one of his readers that feels like me, I wouldn't recommend ""On Beauty"". It is a beautiful book (no, truly), with absolutely astonishing reproductions of art works that accompany the points made by the writer as he works along the history of Beauty throughout ages. Despite this, it disappointed me a bit in that I expected a broader view of beauty than the one based on art and philosophy, but that also looked into fashion and old uses, and why concepts evolved to what we understand as beautiful today."

Besides, I suppose the author finished his targets, enumerated in creation: to perceive beauty as a factor well worth to be contemplated independently of the preference we may additionally experience for it; -to set up the connection among splendor and art (on the grounds that splendor turned into on occasion perceived in reality as a exceptional of Nature); - to document the history of beauty (handiest in Western subculture, even though) via artwork (due to the fact only the artists left examples) however no longer to write a records of artwork.

History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This one is hard to review. On the one hand it is beautifully written - at least as it comes across in translation - and extremely erudite. In fact the word 'erudite' is probably the first one that comes to mind when I think of this book, as nearly every passage is dense with references to everything from Greek philosophy to medieval theology to painters of every school from renaissance to cubism. You better have some serious cultural capital in the bank if you intend to get the most of out of this. On the other hand, the book's approach to the subject matter is so abstract at times and the sentences so vague - impressive, but vague - that it can be hard to pin down what it's actually trying to say. If you're expecting something concrete and to the point like 'the Greeks were ass-men while the Romans preferred boobs', forget it. This book is dealing with beauty on a conceptual, almost subliminal level, understood through say, a culture's general view of proportion and symmetry as seen through its artistic expressions. If that sounds like it can get a bit hazy, it's because it does."
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book takes a lot of stamina to go through. The concept is quite easy: each chapter contains a short description of the period in question and its understanding of beauty, accompanied by important artworks and literature of the time. These chapters are often just 3-5 pages. Nevertheless it's hard to read (weird layout, at least in the german edition, and hard to understand texts without comments) and boring at times. It doesn't feel like a cohesive book, but rather like lecture notes put together. Period descriptions don't go into details, but mention what's most important. What I really missed was an extensive analysis of the texts and artworks used. 3 stars for a good overview and great choice of artworks. The writing is very academic and the book is full of both quality color reproductions of artworks and excerpts from many many written works. In the written works context was sometimes limited and this added to my feeling of being lost or confused. I would expect the book to be used more as a textbook--a graduate level textbook supported by other text, readings and discussions. This is not a light read."
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It took me forever to finish this book. Probably because I started it with the expectation to understand art better, when this book is truly about beauty and beauty alone. So, pay attention to this aspect if you don't want to be disappointed. If you expect detailed dissections of different paintings, brush stroke stories woven together into one single thread, this is not your book. Eco explains beauty at an academic level, pulling you throughout ages and humans psyches and fleshing his theories from a bird's eye perspective. The paintings are there just to back the hypotheses, as are literary texts. It is left up to the reader to examine the details and decide whether they see the same things as the author. My only complaint: a serious amount of time is spent on antiquity and medieval beauty, while modern forms of beauty are barely touched upon. It might be that modern beauty is more shallow (consumer oriented) and it might also be that Eco's knowledge shines particularly when linked to the first half of human history. But still, I am left wanting more."
History of Beauty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10505.History_of_Beauty/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What a marvel. There is an almost supernatural astuteness to the author's erudition. Even at his most vague, he provides a lens for not only the artistic output of the human centuries, but for society as well. What we have cared about in the Western world, why we have cared about it. Sure, he can sum up things too imprecisely (for instance, he posits that ""The invention of the steam engine marked the definitive advent of aesthetic enthusiasm for the machine, even on the part of poets,"" while nearly ignoring the fact that the Romantics were antagonistic, at best, towards modernity), but the clarity and wonderment he drums up on nearly every page sop up the stains. This is an exquisitely wrought and rendered work (the images are outstanding) that is a must for any artist or art enthusiast's library, as well as that of the curious reader looking to deepen their understanding of history, in general."

Chapter after chapter, it delves in the theory behind aesthetic (which is mostly mathematics and geometry), but is written too superficially to give the reader any basic understanding of the subject matter. Instead of incorporating quotes into the main text, there are excerpts of sources printed in font so tiny and light that it tires the eyes, so I mostly skipped those, and in doing so missed half the book. Granted, I read a German edition, and perhaps the quote situation is different in others? It just wasn't enjoyable in any way, and I'm giving it an extra second star only because of the high quality of illustrations and the fun timelines right in the beginning. Not a thing of beauty."

This survey ranges over such themes as the mathematics of ideal proportions, the problem of representing ugliness, the fascination of the exotic and art for art's sake.

I appreciate how it delves into various historical periods and art forms, providing a rich and thought-provoking perspective on this complex subject. One aspect I dislike is that at times, the book can be quite dense and academic, making it challenging to grasp certain concepts for readers without a background in art history or philosophy. In terms of characters, it's important to note that ""History of Beauty"" is not a novel with traditional characters; instead, it focuses on ideas and historical figures. I find the exploration of various philosophers, artists, and thinkers intriguing and valuable, even though they are not characters in the traditional sense.

It was in this latter role, as a writer of non-fictional, scientific articles, compilations and books, that he wrote the ""history of beauty"", a book that has made it its task to take the reader on a journey from the antique societies to the contemporary times in search of the meaning and evolution of beauty.

I admire Eco’s capacity to document Beauty with little personal intrusion. I spent nearly a month reading and re-reading this book in small bite-sized pieces. In the end it is a journey I enjoyed at the time, but most of the details blur into a few generalisations. It is superbly illustrated volume, worth keeping at hand just to browse from time to time.

Some of the quoted primary texts were overly long, and created a disjointed reading experience of jumping between the main text, the visuals, and the quotations. That said, the visuals (mostly art in the form of paintings) were quite stunning, though perhaps cliche choices, but they were still beautifully replicated in this book. I was looking more for a book about our shifting definitions of physical beauty, both over time and place, and Eco's , while still interesting, didn't quite provide what I wanted."

This thoughtfully curated book delves into the evolving concept of beauty, using a collection of artworks, essays, and excerpts from influential thinkers. While it challenges readers to contemplate the subjective nature of beauty, some sections may be dense and require patience. Overall, it's a masterful compilation that invites readers to reflect on the ever-shifting landscape of human aesthetics, making it a valuable addition to the library of art and philosophy enthusiasts."

What is beauty? Umberto Eco, among Italy’s finest and most important contemporary thinkers, explores the nature, the meaning, and the very history of the idea of beauty in Western culture. The profound and subtle text is lavishly illustrated with abundant examples of sublime painting and sculpture and lengthy quotations from writers and philosophers.

It is a survey of artists’ and writers’ styles in relation to some vague definitions of beauty and artistic and literary movements. No original research, no compelling comparisons between eras or with current perceptions. I would have maybe liked this book more if I had been expecting it to be what it was and chosen it for that reason. Additionally, the writing is extremely awkward."

Beauty is now considered more important or ethical. The book makes some unique points. I appreciate the author's reflection on how true beauty is something you can't boast about but rather how you must handle it, particularly when someone compliments your attractiveness. Umberto Eco excellently explained what is considered beautiful, how it relates to what is considered good, how it relates to possession, and comes to the conclusion that beauty has nothing to do with greed or the need to possess."

I particularly liked the reflections on the cosmos and proportions. There were some great reflections on beauty and philosophy. Yet, the book was overwhelming white and Eurocentric in a way that elides how beauty has been understood throughout history through racialized imagery (see Kim F. Hall’s work for ex.)

The central thesis is that procrastination is often harmful to our long-term success, and of this point I have no disagreement. However the majority of the book is replete with superstition, thinly veiled proselytizing, bullshit facts, and other miscellaneous woo-woo including: * Hitler was an artist that started WWII because he was procrastinating, and, as a result of this, nobody has seen his paintings. (Seriously, Google his art. He sucked at being a decent human being but was a pretty good artist!) * Procrastination is the root of erectile dysfunction! * Terminal and non-terminal cancer patients go into remission because they achieve some goal that makes them happy. (This is a particularly egregious assertion!) * People that procrastinate develop tumors and mental illness. * If people overcame procrastination, prisons would magically empty, nobody would get cosmetic surgery or drink alcohol, pharmaceutical companies would collapse, hospitals would close, and all doctors would be out of a job! Dandruff would even cease to exist! * When you do something to better yourselves, other people may get sick. Indeed, you may allegedly get sick as a way to avoid bettering your life. * The author makes an unsubstantiated claim that diseases such as ADHD, seasonal affective disorder, and social anxiety disorder are not real and were invented by marketing departments and drug companies to make a quick buck. * 70-80% of people that go to the doctor aren't sick, but are just being dramatic. * Professionals should without question ignore any and all criticism because all criticism from others is an act of envy, rather than a tool to improve. (Oops!) * Some mystical bullshit was the driving force behind , the Parthenon, and , not actual people. This book is very absolutist and extremist, and fails to take into account the occasions an internal resistance to doing something is not true procrastination, but the cornerstone of good judgment and sometimes even self-preservation. The author even goes so far to say that taking care of your eight month pregnant wife is a form of procrastination! It's almost as if the author hasn't debated the ideas in this book with himself or others, but just started uncritically penning all his unfiltered thoughts into this book. This book earned its second star for being unintentionally funny in places and for the occasional nugget of crap-coated wisdom. If you read this book, find the wisdom (there's very little), clean it up, and make a note. Discard the rest. It's a short read especially as many of the pages are half, or even two thirds empty; just keep keep your critical thinking skills switched on. How this book got so many glowing reviews and recommendations is beyond me."

I've read and reread it several times, but it just doesn't do it for me. I gave it the second star because he does give some good advice about committing to the work, and staying in the seat. Some good bits about discipline and such. I have about 13 years of collegiate and graduate art school under my belt, and I've worked in the fine and commercial arts. Thing is, I hate seeing the challenge of making art turn into this romanticized, epic battle between the poor put-upon artist and Mighty Resistance. Maybe it's just that I've heard so much dreck about artists being ""prophets"" and such over the years that it just hits a sore spot. Plus, there's the idea he puts forward that you haven't really turned ""pro"" until you've dismissed all non-art related activity from your life. He's awfully judgmental against those who strive for a balanced, comprehensive life as opposed to a two-dimensional one. A better book, more honest and less pretentious, is ."

There are a lot of negative reviews of it on Goodreads, mostly about it being derivative, and/or unnecessarily characterizing the creative process as a struggle. Guys: you picked up a self-help book. You picked up a book called ""The War of Art"". If you hoped for originality, or a touchy-feely art-is-easy book, you made a strange decision. I'm just saying. Personally, I found this book pretty useful. It's dense, wise, and low-bullshit. Spiritual, yes. Namby-pamby, no. It treats inspiration as a mystery (because, um, it is). It does not treat art as a mystery. It says, you can't manufacture inspiration, so get your butt in the chair, every day, and do the work so inspiration has the opportunity to come. I'm intrigued by his idea that the difference between a professional artist and an amateur is that the professional artist loves the art enough to arrange her/his life to allow him/her to do it full-time. An amateur, he says, isn't someone who does it only for the love; if the amateur really loved the art s/he wouldn't be content to be a weekend warrior. An amateur identifies with the work: ""I make sandwiches for a living, and I'm an artist"", whereas a professional does the work for its own sake: ""I'm a person who writes novels for a living."" He also does this Jungian analysis of where art comes from and where internal resistance comes from. I'm sure it's not earthshattering, but I'd never heard it before."

I tore out the two good pages, one of which was a quotation from W.H. Murray and the other of which quoted King Leonidas, and burned the book in the fireplace. That's how angry it made me. Horrible waste of paper and time. Really, you want more details? Okay. The author personifies Resistance and then writes a tiny little snippet about it, one per page, stretching a teaspoonful of insight out for seventy pages or so. Sure, we come up against resistance in every area of our lives. This isn't news to anyone. But the ways he personifies it contradict each other, or simply don't make any sense, or come across as pure page-filling psychobabble. Worst of all, he manages to blame the reader for everything. You feel resistance because it's easier! If you don't feel it, you're going the wrong way! If you don't feel it, you're making a step down in life. Sex is resistance! Food is resistance! Exercise is resistance! Everything good is resistance! Unless it isn't! Save yourself some pain and brain cells and avoid this book.

Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.” The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles ~~ Steven Pressfield Reading this book was like a slap in the face to me. I AM a director and a writer. I struggle often to find my identity in my written words. We all of us artists ~~ writers, directors, painters, photographers, dancers, musicians ~~ have faced all the serious struggles that comes with being an artist. We have to face the inner terror in order to get to where we want to go in our art. shows us we need to face our fears and not let those fears overtake us ~~ not give into the resistance. Fear infects our creativity and prevents us from extracting the creative forces we need to create. Most importantly, as artists, we must be open to rejections, judgments and failures. All artists, even those that are best known to us, have experienced rejection. Use these rejections as motivation to improve your talents and skills and inspire you to love and embrace your craft even more. Pressfield devotes much of to God, the Universe, Consciousness, Angels and Spirit Guides. I love this approach of viewing himself as a channel for the Muse. Pressfield says a prayer to the Muse every morning before he begins his writing. You don’t have to believe this approach to get something out of his book. But what you will learn is to fight for your art -- to fight for yourself."

It has: • Harmful, uninformed medical opinions (Why?? It's a book on creativity. Just NO.) • Bizarre and illogical assessments of historical figures • COMPLETELY FAKE STATISTICS (How did those even survive editing? You can't make figures up to back your outrageous opinions. You need real sources. They should be cited. This is the fastest way to enrage a librarian.) • Constant judgment (as if I can't get enough of that in small town Missouri) • So much repetition I want to poke my eyes out (because I'm not an idiot and got it the first 50 times you said it) • And an exhausting, superior, egotistical attitude. I can't believe I wasted money on such a terrible book. It can go straight to hell, where I'm sure creative folk are being forced to read it for eternity--which is about the best argument I've ever heard for salvation. And yes, that's officially the meanest thing I've ever said about any book, ever, and I don't regret it. This book earned my disdain, and I'd like to save the rest of you from a terrible reading experience. Typically, I avoid posting one star ratings and reviews, but since this is parading about calling itself nonfiction, I have to interject to say it's nothing more than a bizarre and often offensive opinion piece, full of some very obvious statements about creativity. Don't read this drivel, unless you just enjoy judgmental, condescending monologues that go nowhere.

HC had it in for the phonies, and Pressfield has no use for them, either. Only he's met the enemy and it is himself. And you, gentle reader, need only a mirror to find your enemy. Pressfield calls it ""Resistance,"" and it lurks in all of us. What's more, it's every excuse you can possibly think of to delay doing what the Muse put you on this earth to do: procrastination, rationalizations, physical sicknesses, psychological conditions with funny letters, family, drama, Twitter, Facebook, busywork, alcohol, drugs, television, your cellphone, fatigue, hopelessness, etc. Hemingway? Oh, yeah. To make it more personal for those who would write, EH called out the writers who wanted to be seen ""writing"" at the cafés of Paris in the 1920's. It was the Lost Generation's version of ""I'm not a writer, but I play one in cafés."" Pressfield, a writer as well, often alludes to the trade in . Too often, writing is something phonies talk of doing and dream of doing but just don't do, or do sporadically, or make excuses as to why they can't do it, or do and fail once or twice, then quit. ""Amateurs,"" Pressfield calls them. The world is split between the ""pros"" who sit down, roll up their sleeves, and DO IT every day (and he does mean day) and the ""amateurs"" who talk a good story while shopping at Excuses R Us. Of course, the same applies to most anything the Dreamy You dreams (or once dreamed) of doing. Should you be working out now? Dieting? Training for a marathon? Swimming? Writing? Painting? Volunteering? Reading classics? Starting your own business? You name it, you can do it, but you choose not to. That's right. It's a choice, and we make it easy on ourselves. This little manual falls in the dictionary under “quick read.” magazine calls it “a kick in the ass,” and I can’t argue with that description. Pressfield pulls no punches. He has little choice. The Pretenders are legion and their excuses like Orc armies -- seemingly endless. The book is divided in three. Part One is simply called “Resistance: Defining the Enemy” and leads off with a quote from the Dalai Lama: “The enemy is a very good teacher.” Pressfield identifies resistance in its every form. Trust me when I say you'll recognize yourself, perhaps multiple times over. As the book was penned in 2002, however, he neglects to mention more prevalent forms of ""Resistance"" that exist today. ""I'll start my work, sure... but first, let me check my Twitter feed... or let me check updates on Facebook... or I have to check e-mail and reply to a few folks... or reading can wait because I need to TALK about reading on Goodreads (which, ironically, cuts deeply into reading time, which is sacrificed on the altar of social time masquerading as reading time)."" Hoo, boy. Maybe even reading is a form of delaying what I should be doing -- writing. Then again, I'm writing this review. Is that writing? One voice (amateur) says yes, but another (pro) says no, it's slumming -- a shameless ploy for ""likes"" and comments, not me pursuing art or income as a freelance writer. Hmn. This is worse than I thought. Anyway, Part Two is called “Combating Resistance: Turning Pro” and leads with a Telamon of Arcadia quote: “It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior’s life.” Here's where Pressfield delineates the true pros who tolerate no excuses from “amateurs” who live by them. Page after page, he shares how a professional lives every day: ""A Professional Is Patient,"" ""A Professional Seeks Order,"" ""A Professional Demystifies,"" ""A Professional Acts in the Face of Fear,"" ""A Professional Accepts No Excuses,"" ""A Professional Plays It As It Lays,"" ""A Professional Does Not Take Failure (or Success) Personally,"" ""A Professional Endures Adversity,"" ""A Professional Self-Validates,"" and on and professionally on. No wonder being a slacker and killing hours online is easier. Part Three? It’s called “Beyond Resistance: The Higher Realm” and its lead quote comes compliments of Xenophon: “The first duty is to sacrifice to the gods and pray them to grant you the thoughts, words, and deeds likely to render your command most pleasing to the gods and to bring yourself, your friends, and your city the fullest measure of affection and glory and advantage.” It’s about achievement once you’re disciplined and have mentally accepted the challenge. Interestingly, Pressfield shares some quirky opinions about Muses, angels, William Blake, William Wordsworth, self vs. ego, and hierarchal thinking vs. territorial thinking. Hint: choose self over ego, territory over hierarchy. Then mean what you say and spit out your excuses binky. Anyway, if you’ve ever wanted to write a book, poem, or screenplay; paint or dance or sing or act; start a business or charity; lose weight and exercise regularly until you look like you should look; run a marathon; fill-in-the-blank with your once-upon-a-time hope for yourself before Twitter and Facebook and e-mail and job and family and social drama and “health issues” and excuses dragged you down, this just might be your book. It's short, but worthy of rereading. I can imagine returning to certain excerpts for an old-fashioned butt-kicking, then getting back on that horse beside Nike (""Just Do It!"") and working in ""the smithy of my soul"" like I ought to. I can also imagine unplugging, or at least creating more strict guidelines for bad habits that have snuck in to choke my creative being like so much hypnotic kudzu. Wait. Did I just say ""imagine""? What an amateur pledge that was...."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I read this book over and over again as necessary. It is the kick in the ass every artist needs, sometimes daily. Because we all face the same enemy, fight the same battle every day: Resistance. According to Pressman, this is the whole story. Every day you either win or lose your battle with resistance. All the rest is talk. Why you lost it doesn't matter. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough. Maybe you don't believe in yourself enough. Maybe you think you're not as talented as you wish you were. Well, so what? No one's mother loved them enough, all of us suffer from self-doubt (If you don't, you're a sociopath and I don't want to know you), and even Shakespeare wrote about ""Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope."" If Shakespeare sometimes thought he wasn't good enough, I think that lets the rest of us off the hook. The only answer is to get up every day and do your work to the best of your ability. That's all anyone does. I just watched a snippet of a video interview with the painter Chuck Close who said you don't need most of what you learn in grad school ever again. You need only three things: to know where to find the information you need, to develop good work habits, and to acquire the thickest skin possible and be able to listen to and ignore the most painful criticism imaginable. You have to be able to defend your own position and criticize others as harshly as they criticize you. And then just go ahead and do your own work. Great book. I recommend this more than any other book I've ever read."

Attention Deficit Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder aren't ""real""--they are merely excuses that we give ourselves because we don't want to succeed; 2. The reason Hitler killed millions of Jews is because he didn't have a creative outlet, and he should have painted more; 3. Since creativity requires a healthy body as well as a healthy mind, overweight people can never truly be creative. I am happy to report that this is false. Since finishing this awful (but mercifully brief) book, I have already thought of several dozen ways the author can go f**k himself. Sounds like THIS fat man's creativity is working just fine."

The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance."" Those sentences grabbed me and have stayed with me. How much do I resist? How do I resist? Why do I resist? The reflection that chapter inspired was well worth reading the rest of the book though nothing else was as revolutionary for me-- I got what I needed early in the pages. There's also a fabulous quote from WH Murray later, ""The moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too."" It reminded me of why I like to operate from passion. That the things that I am doing because I feel I must or out of obligation are never easy. The things that I do from passion always spin out with dizzying force. When you act from passion, providence indeed moves. A timely reminder."

Clear, inspiring, and short. (Also, inexpensive, which seems remarkably fair in this era.) Yes, roughly half of the book is a little... ethereal, perhaps. More Pressfield's life philosophy and spirituality than anything, and not helpful to me. But I'm not going to knock a star off it for that. I've read too many business books that are 15 pages of gold surrounded by 200 pages of fluff to get angry when an author legitimately gives a work his all--and gives 50 pages of gold and 50 pages of Not For Me, Thanks. Where it's good, it's great. I highlighted many, many passages. It left me hungry to go do more work."

Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.” ― Steven Pressfield, The War of Art Three stars in both content and delivery, but I should probably also disclose that I REALLY struggle with the whole self-help genre and this was basically just a self-help book for writers and artists. I'm not sure if it genetic, or shaped by my own experience on this blue dot, but I generally HATE all forms and types of self-help book. ""The sub-genre of ""How to Create"" books, however, are infinitely better than ""How to Business"" or ""How to Love"" or ""How to Win"". Even with the best writers (and I like Pressfield a lot) the lot are usually filled with jargon, cliches, and almost religious rites/steps to salvation/success. At their core, they also usually contain a couple good ideas that might not have required a whole book. The War of Art's good idea can be summarized by Nike's slogan: Or perhaps, my dad's slogan: This book is basically Pressfield giving the reader ideas about how to overcome creative roadblocks. He describes why there ARE roadblocks, gets a bit philosophical about the nature of roadblocks for creativity, etc., and then give the reader his strategy. Basically, Pressfield says you gotta do the hard stuff. You gotta work. Ignore distractions and do what it is you want to do, that you dream of doing, NOW. That's it really."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Steven Pressfield’s The War of Art is essentially an extended pep talk/motivational speech meant to pump the reader up into doing what they’re putting off doing, be it going for a new job, starting a new diet or whatever, though ostensibly it’s aimed at wannabe writers. And it’s a bit too generic for my blood. I’ve read a few books like this – off the top of my dome, Stephen King’s On Writing, Benjamin Percy’s Thrill Me and Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck – all of which did it better than Pressfield. This slim volume is made up of three sections. The first identifies Resistance (basically his all-encompassing label for procrastination/fear/laziness) and was overly long for describing such a simple concept; the second tells you how to tackle Resistance (answer: the Nike slogan – Just Do It!); and the third is full of woowoo with Pressfield going off the deep end, waffling on about angels(!) and divine destiny. The book is fairly well written and I agree with most of what Pressfield has to say about getting comfortable with the uncomfortable in order to progress, knuckling down and getting on with it, creating a routine, being patient, fighting apathy, not listening to any negativity in your head, etc. I wouldn’t say it was useful for anyone looking for practical advice on overcoming procrastination or writing though as Pressfield tends to generalise most of what he says, which is fluff about beating doubt and being the hero of your own story. And the repetitive and tedious nature of the content makes for a very uninteresting read. The advice is banal self-help stuff that’s been said a million times before and Pressfield’s personal anecdotes were uninspiring and dull. I love the Joe Rogan Experience podcast but I have no idea what Joe sees in this one. And that’s what I’d recommend for inspiration/motivation instead of this book: Joe’s podcast, particularly the episodes with Jocko Willink and Jordan Peterson."

This book is upset that it had to be written because the author made himself think that he had to stay in a chair everyday writing regardless of however else he may have felt at the moment. This book is an awesome example of someone who apparently believes in the explicit value of free speech but denounces free will. I finished it a few days ago and have since been seriously trying to understand how it was published. FIrst of all, it's not a book. It's an assortment of thoughts that seem to have spewed out of the authors mind in a frenzy. Probably due to some crazy circumstance that was way more interesting than anything written on the pages of the book itself. Was there an editor? Or even someone doing page layout? Or a fact checker? Was it self published? What's up with the one sentences taking up parts of entire pages as if it they are such epic thoughts that they deserve such suspension? I thought this book was going to provide practical advice on how to achieve a higher state of discipline. It doesn't. It does though attempt to bully you into fulfilling your 'purpose' as a creative being. According to the author we all have a purpose to fulfill and if we ignore it he will yell at us, like he does on the last page. That page is awesome. I wonder if this person is aware that some people actually do not have purposes, they were born and there is not one thing in the world that interests them, and it is not due to procrastination or resistance. I wonder what he thinks of such people who achieve nothing, nor care to and remain healthy their entire lives. I wonder what he thinks of teenagers who have never procrastinated a day in their lives and are diagnosed with cancer or mental disorders nonetheless. I wonder if he realizes that if someone is in tune with themselves that resistance and fear are on their side."

But it’s also inspirational to folks who want to start exercising or lose weight or quit some addiction. The basic message is, essentially, you can’t keep saying stuff to yourself like, “I’ll start the novel tomorrow.” “I’ll start exercising/eating well tomorrow.” It’s all about overcoming Resistance to whatever goal(s) you have. According to one segment, “Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you’re feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there’s tremendous love there too. If you didn’t love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn’t feel anything. The opposite of love isn’t hate; it’s indifference.” This book is a lot of encouragement to delay gratification and work toward longer term goals. Drugs, alcohol, sex, and so on are ways to occupy our minds and our time and put off other goals we might have in mind, like starting a business or furthering our educations or finishing that novel we’re writing. It’s the kind of book you can flip a few pages through to remind yourself why you aren’t spending all your free time watching movies and drinking margaritas, which is easy, and therefore, fun. Working on bettering ourselves takes, well, work."

I write everyday, and this book helped me do it. ""The War of Art"" made me feel bad about my relationship with the creative process. She would invite me out and I'd decide to wash my hair instead. He would call and I'd push the button that sent it straight to voicemail. I was a lousy friend. Illuminating what Pressfield defines as resistance and turning pro turned the tables on myself and forced me to take a hard look at my habits and decide if I was hungry enough to change them. I'm on day three of beans and rice; I'm hungry. I started the book identifying with the person who wrote the forward-- a fellow procrastinator capable of banging out a decent product-- and finished it seeking ways to exhibit the same qualities Steven has-- discipline, integrity, and patience.

Let's get the good parts over with: I highlighted more things in here than I'm comfortable with. (I feel faintly dirty about this, as though I've eaten food found in a dumpster.) It's nice to see someone acknowledging that we can be afraid of our work, and that we can manage that fear. There's some not bad--if not terribly original--advice about scheduling, professionalism-as-routine, and some other things that may well be useful to you, as I fear--as I'm terrified, really--that they may be to me. But Jesus, Mary, and Joseph: the bullshit. Imagine Robert Evans on MDMA writing about Jung for ""Reader's Digest."" Angels live in the world, and they're real, and they help us write; disease is what happens when we give in to Resistance (capitals in original--oh, so many capitals), and overcoming work problems may cure cancer; the 'Gita and Coyote Trickster and the Muses and Tiger Woods all say that work is a holy thing that we don't own but belongs to the universe. More beliefs: food with fat in it is a sign that we are deceiving ourselves, when we should be creating; mental illness doesn't really exist, and goes away if we continue to work. And etcetera. This man is past self-delusion and into full-on hallucination. This book is five hundred times worse than a one-page .pdf of its ten useful sentences. If you can find such a .pdf, read that. If you can't, oh boy: maybe come for the chuckle reel that is 90% of the prose, and stay for the occasional nugget of insight that drifts, as though from another universe, onto the page."

I don't remember when I added it anymore, but I know it was a while ago. There was a period of time this summer where I simply could not write *at all.* I tried everything--I tried to read book about writers block like The Midnight Disease. Nothing in them helped me. I went to different places to try and write. Nothing. I made myself sit down with only my AlphaSmart and refused to get up for three hours or until I'd at least written something. The hours would pass, and I would write nothing. And then I'd cry. I was slowly but surely becoming convinced I'd never write again, and it broke my heart. (All of me felt broken, actually) And then I saw this book in my local bookstore and took a look at it. And what I read blew me away. Pressfield doesn't talk about specifically about writer's block but about Resistance, and the thing he said that made me buy the book, take it home and read the first two sections over and over again (the third one is about muses and things and I'm not into that) was this: All those things I'd done to try and make myself write and I'd never once stopped to think about WHY I wasn't writing. But Pressfield got me to do that, and he got me to realize that it was my fears that were stopping me, and that writing can't be about overcoming everything that's got you trapped in a corner or scared. It has to--and must be--simply about the writing. It's not easy to overcome those fears, and I keep a copy of The War of Art next to what I'm currently working on, and turn to it when I need a reminder that it's okay to be afraid, and that the important thing is to keep going."

I’ve had The War of Art on my TBR list for years and finally made time for it over the last two days, in the 11th hour of 2018. The book is full of ways to recognize and overcome roadblocks in the realm of creativity. While Pressfield often provides examples related to being a professional writer, the concepts can easily be applied to any professional discipline. The book is divided into 3 parts: Resistance (Defining the Enemy), Combating Resistance (Turning Pro), and Beyond Resistance (The Higher Realm). I really enjoyed the first two sections, which I found preferable to the third, but the book is great all around. I could relate to many of the ways we let resistance impact us, but also could relate to some of the ways we distinguish professionals from amateurs. Both a nice reminder of what you have accomplished, and that there’s still room to grow and for improvement. I highlighted quotes throughout and know it’s a book worth revisiting in the future, for fresh doses of motivation. It is a timely read, as people often look to set new goals for a new year. It is timeless because the concepts - including the discipline required to succeed - ring true, again and again."

""The War of Art"" is precisely about how to muster strength and determination in any creative enterprise against our inner adversary, which he calls Resistance (name it procrastination or self-sabotage or writer's block if you prefer). The books is divided into three sections: 1) a definition of what Resistance really is and how it manifests itself, 2) guidelines on how to fight Resistance and stop bullshitting oneself, 3) a somewhat romantic (jungian / nietzschean) development on inspiration, enthusiasm (in the etymological sense), connecting to the Self and becoming what we are. I have picked up this book from the shelf in order to get a boost for a writing project I'm working on (and because it was prefaced by Robert McKee!). Two sentences particularly remain on top of my mind: ""If I were diagnosed with terminal cancer, would I keep doing what I do?"" and ""If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it?"" These are a couple of the kicks in the ass I got while reading this book. I need to begin now."

On the one hand, I appreciated the brevity and the candor, and on the other, the self-righteous overtones were alienating and borderline dictatorial. I don't underestimate the work ethic and writing talent of Mr. Pressfield; however, if you are looking for practical approaches to consistently battling your bouts of procrastination and creative blocks without sacrificing the relationships that matter most in life (aka real friends and family), look elsewhere. What makes this book borderline off-putting is that the three contemporary male figures noted for their ""acts of commitment,"" and are referenced more than once throughout, are all men that have failed their families and the public: Lance Armstrong, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Tiger Woods. In addition, it is darn near impossible to find anything from Mr. Pressfield regarding his commitment to his family, (uncertain that he has one?), and overwhelmingly easy to find his thoughts on his commitment to being an artist, thriving as an artist, and loving an artist. It is a bit tough to swallow the words of an artist when the word commitment only applies when it is to serve your advantage."

Steven Pressfield is a novelist, and he calls the enemy ""Resistance"". He has seen Resistance in his own life many times. He lists the many activities that elicit resistance. These include pursuit of writing, painting, music, film, dance, or any other creative art. And he defines creative activities very loosely; it can include being an entrepreneur of any kind, a scientist, an educator, a student, anyone trying to attain spiritual advancement, anyone trying to overcome an unwholesome habit or addiction, an athlete ... the list goes on. Resistance comes from inside ourselves, although we rationalize it as being caused externally. Resistance is any excuse we can come up with, to defer our creative work. And Pressfield gives some good advice about how to battle against Resistance. The essence is to ""be professional"" in our creative work. He explains what it means to ""be professional"", and how to go about it. Basically, it means to show up every day, no excuses, to be committed over the long haul, to obtain remuneration for our labor, master the techniques of our jobs, and to have a sense of humor about our jobs. There is much more to it than that, of course. But if you have any type of creative block, this book might help you. It is so short--you can read it in a couple of hours. It's worth it."

I felt extremely motivated to continue my efforts on a few projects that had been languishing on the back burner. The author shines a very bright light on that cunning, rational voice we all have that convinces us to wait, procrastinate or never start a new venture. He calls it resistance and expounds that the greater resistance you have to something, the more important it must be. Written in concise chunks, some only a page or paragraph long, I was compelled to keep reading. The author's voice is refreshing and the ideas clear and relevant.

This is a must-read by any one interested in doing ANYTHING other than the average with their life. He focuses a lot on writing, but it clearly applies to anything you are called to do in your life, but seem unable to get yourself to do it. I have been working on-and-off on my 1st book for 5 years. I have had so much resistance to sitting down and writing, even though I love writing my blog pieces. Within pages, Pressfield clearly spell out the trouble, and just by recognizing it I was able to sit down and write EVERY DAY WITH ENTHUSIASM. He begins by talking about Resistance, what it is, it's many forms, and why it functions in our lives. Sometimes recognizing the problem is all you need to do to move beyond it. He continues with what it means to be a Professional (akin to a Warrior) and how to combat Resistance. It's as if my entire relationship with writing has been flipped on its head. I knew many of these things peripherally, I suppose, but I needed to see them in words in front of my face to make the difference.

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is first and foremost a treatise on writing as labor. Writing is work -- much like going to the gym, fighting a battle, or plowing a field. That is the philosophy of the book -- one I tend to agree with. Haruki Murakami talked in much similar terms about writing in his book about running. He wrote a book about running and the discipline of running; but he was also talking about the virtues necessary to be a writer. Much of the book talks about the forces of ""Resistance."" Think about resistance as the accumulated forces trying to get you not to write, not to finish, to say you're a writer but to really live life as a fraud. It also tells a story -- over a course of vignettes -- about how one writer deals with his personal form of resistance. The book is about motivation and professionalism. There are parts about other things, but mostly the book is about those things. You may also like the chapters about muses. Most of the passages are written in 1-2 page vignettes. Thus, perhaps the best way to read this book is in five to ten minute sessions before you're about to write. This book is unrateable. It’s clear the author’s audience is himself. You may rebuke, “When is writing not?” But honestly, this time it really is for himself. It is very personally written. (I've written something very similar for myself, and it reads similarly). Thus, much of it will not connect with you. When it does, though, it will likely connect deeply. Does that make it a two-star, three-star, four-star...it doesn't matter. If you need this book. Read this book. I didn't need to read this book, but I still benefited from it. If you really don't need this book because you never face resistance when you write, then you don't need this book at all. Here is the strange thing, one section in particular – Resistance and Fundamentalism -- just blew me away. I’m also an International Relations scholar and it’s been a long time since I’ve read anything on Fundamentalism that rang so clear and beautiful as that.

However I felt that the reasons behind the beliefs are ego driven, derisive and flippant. He makes unsubstantiated analogies and in many portions contradicts himself. He engages in belligerent novice bashing. He vehemently repeatedly reminds us that hes a 'pro' and leaves us with little material useful for practical application. Its not an accessible book since the entire narration sounds like hes pissed off and in turn taking it out on the reader. As he mentioned in the book he had years of failure and writers block. Due to that, hes written a manifesto on the tribulations of not getting over it in a timely manner. I felt the angst and passion. Yet I also felt that those feelings took away from his writing original well structured ideas and notions on the overall subject of writing. In the first portion of the book he says you should write in a rote way and not consider what your doing as art. That its work like any other job, lacking loftiness. Then in the second half he says that not only is writing art but thats its something godly and divine."

I won't be finishing it. Normally I wouldn't leave a review, and I've never bothered to leave one star, but I am so irritated right now. If you have ever been gas-lighted I do not recommend reading this book it could be triggering. I wrote four novel and one novella all while trying to naturally manage my depression and anxiety. I finally decided it shouldn't be that hard to feel ""normal"" and talked to my therapist and doctor about medication. My depression and anxiety were not a form of resistance and the author dismissing mental, emotional, and physically illness is offensive. Saying that 80% of the time doctors are dealing with patients who are making up their illnesses is insane. I personally know women whose broken bones, cysts, cancer, were ignored by doctors. This is dangerous and might prevent people from seeking medical help. And to insinuate that if Hitler had overcome resistance to his art he wouldn't have come into power and murdered millions is beyond vile."

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book was annoying, but I liked it OK. I thought it was funny that most of the people the author held up as paragons of success are borderline psychopaths who have cheated and lied their way to the top (Lance Armstrong) or have cheated and lied their way through their personal lives (Arnold Swarzenegger and Tiger Woods). The author contradicts himself, too: In the chapter ""For the Love of the Game"" he says, ""Playing for money, or adopting the attitude of one who plays for money, lowers the fever,"" which is a good thing, according to him. Sounds like the definition of a hack to me, right? Using your talent to complete an assignment that you don't want in order to get paid? But then later in the book he says not to be a hack, that using your talent with the aim of making money will kill ""the muse."" Even though he has clearly done it himself, throughout his career as a writer, in order to make money and get where he is today. The book itself has a hackish feel to it. One of its redeeming qualities is that it's a fast read--I finished it in a couple of hours (I'm a slow reader). And I liked when he talked about dreams he's had and their meaning and the difference between hierarchical thinking and territorial thinking. All the ""fighting resistance"" cheer-leading was good, too, in its way. But I never would have read this book if a friend hadn't given me a copy. If I'd leafed through it in a bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it, because it's too cliched and dogmatic for my tastes. And unintentionally funny, the way a know-it-all blowhard is. P.S. And he actually says people have been cured from cancer because, after they got their diagnosis, they started doing what they loved. Yes, I'm sure the chemotherapy and radiation and surgery had nothing to do with their cure. It was all because they started fighting resistance and doing what they loved. He should contact all the medical research centers and tell them of his startling cure for cancer! Shut down all the cancer hospitals, because once people find out they just have to start doing what they love instead of undergoing yucky chemotherapy, hospitals will be obsolete!"

Towards the end of the film, a music journalist was comparing Kurt Cobain to Dave Grohl and said, “If Kurt Cobain is the artist, Dave Grohl is the craftsman.” This kept coming to mind when reading “The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield. Cobain was the tormented artist, who couldn’t handle the stresses of his own success. Grohl stuck it out and has been part of two highly successful bands and contributes to several others, regardless of commercial response. In this book Pressfield is hard on the artist. He points out art in and of itself doesn’t just happen “when the mood strikes”. Art requires dedication. It requires discipline. It requires detachment not only from the art itself, but also from how the world sees the product. It requires knowing art cannot be measured by anything tangible. In theory, this book is about the creative process. But really it's about anything which requires commitment and perseverance. Our ego wants it easy. In reality nothing worth doing is . . . Some of the reviews use the word “bully” to describe Pressfield’s point of view. I disagree, and I believe Pressfield is correct in his attitude regarding success at any endeavor in that professionals are dedicated, hence the term “professional”. No one in this world gets a free ride for very long. I’d recommend this book to anyone. It’s a book about dreaming big. It’s about knowing the saying “when God closes a door he opens a window” is kinda lame. If a door is closed, it’s just closed. Turn the freakin’ knob! Or decide whatever is on the other side of it isn’t worth the energy. Regardless, make a decision and live it with no regrets."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Maybe I'm missing something here. With all of the great reviews I thought that this book would become an invaluable resource for me. What I got was utter nonsense. I found the author to be a condescending, angry man who was so busy reliving his failures while simultaneously asserting that his ""creativity"" is a divine gift, that I could not relate to him at all. I also found his thoughts on mental illness like anxiety and depression and physical illness like cancer to be completely offensive. How dare he assert that every person suffering from mental illness or a horrific disease like cancer is putting it upon themselves by not following their creative pursuits? We find multiple instances of highly creative (and successfully creative at that) people who were tragically felled by these illnesses. He gave no real advice, either, other than get your ass in a chair and force yourself to work which I think we all already knew. I did not find this inspiring or moving in the least."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"One of those books that is helpful for anyone who sometimes struggles with the creative process. I think what I liked the most about this book was it's emphasis on demystifying what it really means to create and in pointing out the dangers that come from the self-importance we sometimes assign to ourselves as creators. The professional (as opposed to the amateur) knows how vital to her life it is to be able to create but there is a humility and a modesty that accompanies this knowledge. It really is more about quietly going about creating, doing your life-appointed work with integrity, in accordance with your heart, rather than talking about it or worrying about it. There's a spiritual dimension to this book that gave it a depth missing in many motivational books. The spiritual dimension is the recognition of the existence of ""Muses."" Muses is the name the author gives to the mysterious force we sometimes encounter in the process of creating - a sense that words or images or energy, are being given to us, a sense that we are serving a larger purpose through our work and that purpose is fulfilled whether our work brings us recognition from others or not."

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},I read this book years ago. I think about it all the time. It’s a classic.
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Fair warning - the book is written in frank soldierly language; I will critique it in kind. At one level, this is a straight up 'fatherly' self-help book. Its message is simple. Stop procrastinating, stop making excuses, and get your sorry ass to work. No tricks; no magic; just do it. This is Pressfield channeling the DI. But beyond that, and what makes this more than just a swift kick in the pants to someone that is down, is that this is fundamentally a spiritual, theological book. I'm just not certain what sort of theology or spirit. A lot of the basic premise will be familiar to any Christian. This could have very easily been a little Christian enchiridion about winning the fight against Sin. Stephen Pressfield's word for sin is Resistance. It's a good word, as it well encapsulates how one experiences the phenomenon when one becomes aware of it and starts to try to fight it. As Pressfield talks about the subject, we are reminded of St. Paul’s writings on the subject of Resistance: ""For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, "" - Galatians 5:17 And also: ""For that which I do I allow not: If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"" - Romans 7: 15-25 So far so good. But while reading Pressfield is a little easier than reading St. Paul, I am also in reading it reminded of the Apology by Plato in which he has Socrates say: ""After the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be instantly detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them--thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. The poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise."" At least a third of 'The War of Art' is bullshit and bloviating. It's full of little digressions, contradictions, follies, and self-validations which it would be tedious to list here. If you are looking for wisdom, don't seek it out in this manual. If you are looking for wisdom, you'll get badly led astray here. Some of his throw it all out there lines are just downright weird and I was frequently glad he didn't bother to explain himself. If you are looking for technique, you'll be on much more solid ground. This is a practical book by a practitioner who gets up each morning and does his best to kick the Resistance in the ass before it kicks him. Refining his theology is obviously less important than walking away from the battlefield something other than a bleeding corpse. Can't fault that. The book is divided into three sections. The first section where he defines the enemy is the best and most solid. Aside from a few weird digressions about how artists have to abandon their friends because they are allied with the Resistance, and a weird tangent on the evils of Fundamentalism which makes me think he doesn't know any actual Fundamentalists (or much about art history) and is hence just blowing smoke out of his ass, this is really good stuff. The second section talks about combating resistance. Again, much of this is solid provided you keep your nose unplugged so you can avoid stepping in the squishy stuff. Pressfield says that the key to combating the Resistance is to adopt what he calls the professional attitude. Essentially, the Professional stays busy. He isn't idle because he doesn't let himself be idle. He works purposefully and he never stops working. As Paul would say, ""He runs the good race."" But Pressfield understands something more than that, and that is that the Professional has Faith; and furthermore, that the universe is ordered such that Faith is mysteriously rewarded. The writer sets down expecting that that inspiration, that genius, will come if he begins in good faith. The third section is about how the professional harnesses that higher aid, which he refers to as the 'mystery'. And here is where it gets really weird, because Pressfield is quite willing to grab any metaphor he can get his hands on to describe this mystery. This is artistic indifferentism. I suppose this is fitting given that every tradition produces artists, but it makes for weird reading. Pressfield is most attracted to classical Greek theology, which makes the third section read like something that is half self-help book and half neo-Pagan new age tract. For me personally, the mix of Epicureanism with Christian theology reminds me most of the equally highly personal theology of Thomas Jefferson, save for one thing. Far more so than even Jefferson, Pressfield is convinced that this 'mystery' is active in the world and boldly proclaims: ""The gods do exist. They do penetrate our earthly sphere."" Which brings us back around to that earlier quote by Plato. Because, for all the minor faults in the work, Pressfield gets it. He isn't just an arrogant asshole yelling at you to get on with it. He knows he's no wiser or better off than the rest of us, save perhaps that he's really realized that he isn't wiser or better than the rest of us and so drops the pretension and just humbly and dedicatedly does what he can do. Then he rambles one for another 30 pages on Jungian this and territoriality that sufficient to convince us of the truth that ""upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise."" But it's ok, because none of that is necessary for the craft. You can get by just fine without any of it, naming the enemy, praying, and making a good start with the faith that the ending is there in the hands of some friendly Divine Muse. Now, where did I put that half finished novel...?"
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Well, Resistance didn't want me to write this review. Why? because it is an endeavor by which I understand the gift of writing embedded in me. It tells me ""you don't want to write something embarrassing! Everybody is watching, You have to choose your words carefully! Do you really have the time? may be not NOW."" She knows that with whatever I can market to others revealing its ugly truth, and that is what it fears the most! But guess what, I am also starting my war against resistance, and so should you. Even though Steven Pressfield presented us a short book, It really is a wondrous realm. He outlines the reason why most people are, not really engaged in what they love; and it is, to put it bluntly, a negative force from within, he calls "" The Resistance"". Steven talks in this book about; how to identify the resistance, its characteristics, its symptoms, how it successfully affects humans, and How, Why and When we try to counter it. He speaks of its origin and location in the whole equation of any artist's life. You may not agree with everything he believes [I don't], but it really hits many aspects of our lives. VERY ENJOYABLE, and hopefully very useful as well. ""Resistance is a repelling force, It is negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our Work."" - he says. So get your bearings my fellow artists, and start your wars! to live your the unlived life scripted in your genes."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Well, that was entertaining. I like Steven Pressfield’s writing style in this book. It is a bit repetitive, and he does at times go somewhat overboard with claims about certain things, but reading the book is like listening to someone that has a lot of passion for the arts tell you how, and why you should get into the arts. I couldn’t help being swept along with the author, and enjoy the ride. I probably wouldn’t put it at the top of a list of the most helpful books for people that want to get into arts because in a sense there isn’t that much in it. There really is just one main idea which he talks about throughout the book. If you feel you have passion for artistic creation, then do it. Do the work despite all the resistance you’ll inevitably have to face. And that is good advice, but perhaps not a whole book worth of advice. But like I’ve already said, I enjoyed the read. I like the passion he brings to the table. It’s a good book."

The blog is Modern Mrs. Darcy and she sends out Kindle deals daily and they are usually the better Kindle deals for literary sorts. All that to say that I bought this for no reason except it was on sale and I call myself a writer sometimes. This is not a profound book but it is very helpful for the writer and the artist. I enjoyed the peek into Mr. Pressfield's writing life and hearing about his failures. In that respect it was a hopeful book. I also agree with him on some levels about how ""the muse"" actually works. It rang true and gave me courage. Not a bad deal. Thanks,Renee."

The rest is standard fare OR actively offensive, like the insinuation anxiety and depression are something we're doing to ourselves to keep us from creating because we're all in thrall to pharma companies. There's aggravating gems like that all through this book and they pop out and sock you in the jaw pretty often, because it's a small book. I'd really recommend watching Jay Smooth's discussion about creativity (he's where I got this rec from) instead of reading this book because he distills the important parts down without dehumanizing people who aren't privileged, able-bodied white dudes."

THOU HAST BEEN WARNED! ---------------------------------------- First of all, the book should be renamed to: The War of Art: Winning the Inner Creative Battle with God's Help. or (try to read it with one breath) The War of Art: Winning the Inner Creative Battle because there's only one path for you to follow, the one God gave you and you cannot change it or choose anything else because it is how it is and you should start creating something for the Almighty because you have to give something back to Him with the help of His trustful angels that guide you throughout the whole thing and you should be thankful for that and do not forget that everything you do is because He wants you to but you also have to work your butt of everyday in spite of all the things I've just said while it would be easier for God to just flick His fingers and do it than use you as a puppet and when the time comes to harvest your labour because He's the Master of the Puppets! (Metallica's song starts playing in the background) The second title is still work in progress but with His help I'm sure that I will find the right path to make it good and right and pure and heavenly. Where are some angels when you need them? Oh, I forgot, I can't hear them shouting their pleas at me to use my gifts and work towards my only path (set by God, mind you) when I'm succumbing to Resistance which Steven Pressfield compared to Hell. (Seriously? Am I reading a book about procrastination or a Supernatural fanfic?) Don't get me wrong, I don't mind people who believe in God nor I think less of them (I used to be one of them) but why so much talk about God in a non-fiction book? (Sorry about the joke, couldn't resist) But seriously now, I think he should have trimmed down some references to God and angels and focus more on the writing part. He says, work your butt of to be better but know that when you do it angels help you? I can't do it myself? Really? I need the help of angels to produce anything? Well, I'm an unworthy piece of human dung if I need constant help of God and God's assistants. The book had some good points (you have to look hard for them though), not new ones that I have never read before on the internet here and there from other artists too (who did not refer to God in every sentence), but nevertheless I will use them for my paper. I just felt that he jumped from one point to another with no reason. First, he says that we should write daily and practice our art, which is right in every way, and then he says we should put in use the gifts God gave us and produce something for him. In my opinion, these are two different things and should not be mixed. I felt like I was being brainwashed into believing that God gave me gifts/talents and I should give my work back to him and that angels are guiding me through my work. Really? I sit down everyday in front of my computer screen and squeeze my brain to think and push myself to write and be better and angels get the credit? I do all the work myself but angels and God are the ones that made me able to? Why would someone write something like that in a book about writing/creating? Why speak so specifically? He made people who believe in God appear awesome and powerful and great and full of potential and here I was looking at the sentences with a big question mark hanging above my head. What the whaaat? Make up your mind Steven, either I do the work and I get credit for it or God does and I don't have to work at all because he's almighty and with a flick of his fingers he can produce the work for me. It can't be both at the same time. Don't mix these things together. Steven doesn't believe in evolution, he doesn't believe that we humans create anything ourselves, but that only God gives so God has to receive something back. I'm not writing anything for God (either he exists or not), I'm writing myself and for myself. Steven tells us to do so many things and push ourselves but when we finally do it's only with God's guidance. What the hell? If God takes the time to help me write/create why doesn't he do it from the beginning and lets me rot in hell while I try to create something with all my power? Oh, because of free will and stuff! Yeah, right... I feel like I'm going to start talking about God and I don't want to because I'm sure I will offend someone (as if I haven't already) so I'll stop here. If you want to read this book and you don't believe in God try to think that all the things Steven says are told metaphorically (it's really hard to do it at some points though). If you can't finish it, it's ok, God will forgive your weakness. (Sorry, Resistance made me write that) Anyways, I'll read some more books about procrastination and writing and I hope they won't be God related (I still can't understand how Steven mixed them together xD)"
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Summary of the first two-thirds of the book: Resistance = you allowing external/internal forces to stop you from doing creatively fulfilling work. Don't allow Resistance to get the better of you. Commit to what you want to do, organize, and then do it. The last third of the book is just self-important bloviating and philosophizing on what it means to be a successful, productive artist. ...That's it. That's literally it. I cannot imagine this book being useful for many people. It's forthcoming about how art as a profession is grueling, which would deter a hobbyist who's toying with the idea of going pro. And, at the same time, it's so utterly lacking in substance that it cannot possibly be of any worth to anyone who has a true desire to become a pro. It doesn't offer advice for fighting your creative battles so much as it tries to textually Tyler Durden you into resolving to take up the creative fight in the first place. After Pressfield took a Goldie Hawn quote criticizing sexism in Hollywood (""[There are only three ages for an actress]: Babe, D.A., and Driving Miss Daisy."") and spun it into a non-insight re: being flexible in your growth and journey as an artist, I threw the book down. admitted that Hawn was making a different point AND YET HE USED THAT QUOTE ANYWAY. Which is a) lazy, b) sloppy, c) just plain bad writing. I picked this up after a former professor recommended it for my writer's block, and it did not help in the slightest. The Paulo Coelho quote stamped on my Chipotle bag is more inspiring. (Although to be fair, Paulo Coelho and Chipotle are pretty great.)"
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was a 4-start book until near the end, when Pressfield sets up what I consider a false opposition between creating for an audience and being true to yourself. We don't consider J.S. Bach a lesser artist for having produced his works for patrons, do we? The War of Art was published before the idea of ""1000 true fans"" gained currency - a group of people who are, in effect, your patrons, who you create your material for and who, in turn, will buy pretty much anything from you. I wonder if Pressfield would still make such a strong dichotomy and cling so hard to the Romantic myth of the loner artist who produces brilliant work that often isn't appreciated by the masses. The modern reality (which the publishing industry needs to embrace, or it's doomed), is that there's no future in making things at random and firing them out at an uncomprehended public in the hope that they'll like one for some inscrutable reason, and buy enough copies to compensate for all the failures. Being in touch with your audience is just as important as being in touch with yourself, and the two are not mutually exclusive. The earlier part of the book, though, on overcoming resistance, is excellent and worthwhile, and I do recommend it."

I really enjoy the first two thirds but I think that the author may lose his most conservative audience to the last third as his spiritual influence has so much imagery attached to it that is counter intuitive to western religion. Growing up around Christian fundamentalism (which he properly criticizes), I have had to fight the inner battle myself and it takes years to get that nonsense truly out of your head so you can work. I wish that the “War of Art” had a softer approach to breaking down the Traditions that hold us back so that the larger message wouldn't be lost. This book is a great reminder of why I work at all. I think that I get caught up in the “rewards” for my labour a little too often and lately when the argument that I should be a better capitalist are presented to me I have been getting sucked into one dimensional thinking. There are so many reasons to do your art. If you find that there is any resistance to you doing your life's work then read this book."

I am all for the benefits of art or whatever makes you happy, and certainly when I'm doing what I love I feel better, but no amount of writing or tax-doing is ever going to change the fundamental chemical imbalance in my brain.

I can't think of a better way to ground myself than with the reminder that Resistance is Out There Waiting and the only thing to do is to keep working. Every day. Diligently. Whether I feel ""inspired"" or on fire or not. Steven Pressfield taught me that the way to be inspired is to sit down and do the work. The muse loves those who serve her faithfully and she will reward us. That's not a theory nor is it a pretty metaphor. I have experienced it again and again.

Facing facts bravely about creative process. This is a no nonsense, ground level approach to the work. There is only the work and the doing of it. There is ego, and there is everything else, and if you connect to ego, you'll be missing the everything else. The ego's job is to stop you from doing anything you're born to do: any artistic endeavor that is sent to you from the ether to be completed. Like viruses are born to spread, ego is born to thwart your every creative move. Every writer/artist knows this in the back of our monkey brain, but we do not know this in our frontal lobes. The concept of an ego out to nail your creative hide to a door is a little creepy, but it makes sense in the part of my brain that doesn't have a headache. The tyranny of a blank page, a blank canvas is where ego goes about starting to undo you. I have written many times about my creative process, and as it turns out, it may be a universal process. I sit down to write. But before I do I have to sharpen my pencil, find another pen, get a different notebook (the one with the shoes on the front), dust my desk, sort the bins from which I got the notebook and the pen, rearrange the talismen, do the dishes, paint the bathroom, clean the garage. The point is to duct tape yourself to the work station and just do it. I like Pressfield's approach because I am an obedient person, and he tells us what to do and then what to do again. This is an artist's practicum, a required course. Sit down, and before you start the work, read this book."

On top of it, I was all the time thinking that I was honoring this talent, the ""Muse"" as Pressfield says. But I wasn't! I was mystifying it, glorifying it, elevating it beyond mortal measures. I was almost abusing it, perking through the heavens, pissing off the Muse. 's statement has one tiny flaw though! It's ""gems"" that this book offers. The writer-wanna-be should read on the lookout. No idea where you might find one of your inner dragons lurking beneath the shadow lines, keeping you from your innermost treasures of creativity and professionalism. The most revolutionary I've ever read! Must-reread!"

I estimate it can be read in an afternoon, but I can't verify that fact since halfway through reading it I had to put the book down because I couldn't stand not following its advices. There exists a strange world of creating work you value, fighting the resistant forces that work against you, and remembering you only have so much time and attention before you're dead. Merlin Mann's talks fall into this category, the entire being of Andrew W.K. falls into this category, and so does The War of Art. If you're ever looking for a book to near-literally give you a kick in the ass to start working on what you love, this is that book. By no means is it self-help, this book is purely self-reliance."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Steven Pressfield uses the analogy of war (I hope it's just an analogy) for the process of writing. He pits Resistance, our human ego, against us as we attempt to write our screenplay or novel. The first chapters are grim, with all the fighting and battles and struggles in our quest to simply write. He proposes we must become Professionals, standing firm against Resistance, showing up every day, ignoring the voices in our head (our ego self) that urge us to give up. I like Elizabeth Gilbert's take on the quest to write better, I think, but Big Magic may not work for everyone and The War of Art definitely offers a more aggressive take on the writing adventure."

Part of me had no idea what he was talking about(at certain points) and the writer in me wishes I'd written this wonderful book before the author did. This is a classic work that anyone with the slightest desire to create anything should not only read but study. It tackles head on the biggest block to every creators journey toward self-expression through their work-the author calls it RESISTANCE. Not only will you nod your head in agreement as you read but you will be equipped with the tools you need to banish fear and procrastination forever and finally GET TO WORK !

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"We all experience a force that pushes us away from our creative endeavors. Whether it be a new diet or exercise regimen, a novel, a painting, a business venture, or a relationship, this force seems to appear every morning along with the sun. Call it what you will---the lizard brain, laziness, procrastination, writer's block, instant gratification---if we want to become the person we are meant to be, we must engage with it, and somehow, do our work anyway. Steven Pressfield, in his magnificent book, , calls it Resistance. The way I choose to see Resistance is biological. Evolutionary. My urge to create comes from the brain's frontal lobe, that human concoction that enables reasoning and abstract thinking. But Resistance comes from the amygdala, which we share with the ""lower"" animals (hence the lizard brain). It's the part of the brain that generates fear and the fight-or-flight reaction. Thus Resistance is impersonal. It's not intending to sabotage me and my work. In fact, it's an essential part of me, whose purpose is to protect me from danger. What kind of danger, though, is immaterial. The problem is, we're not lizards anymore. Danger isn't always physical. It's dangerous to create art and show it to the world---dangerous to our ego and our self-esteem. What if our art is rejected? Then we feel rejected. We feel rejection as a primordial risk---the risk of being cast out from the tribe, ostracized and exiled. But what does that mean? In hunter-gatherer times, it meant you were now on your own, wandering the savanna at the complete mercy of predators. At the mercy of death. The lioness picks off the loner; she doesn't mess with the herd. There are no lions on the streets of New York. Standing out from the pack no longer means death. But Resistance doesn't know that. We can use this. The stronger Resistance we feel toward our work, the riskier it must be. The bolder it must be. The more ground-breaking. Not ground-breaking in a worldly sense, but breaking new ground in our lives, in our souls. We are pushing ourselves farther than we think we can go. We are reaching our potential, expanding our capabilities: Pressfield sees our relationship with Resistance as a war. Each day is a battle. I've got a different view, which I developed in therapy. I learned that I could not dismiss or wish away my anxiety and my fear. No more than I could remove my amygdala and continue walking. Instead, I taught myself how to live with it and how to listen to it. Because how could I fight something that is part of me? And if Resistance is fear, then its presence is a good thing: So don't knock yourself for being afraid. It's normal. It would be weird if you didn't feel it. Gratification is what it's all about. The feeling you get when you want to do something so badly that you can't do anything else. Resistance sees this as a challenge. It uses fear to beat you back. But when you push ahead, through the fear, and complete your quest? That's the feeling that makes it all worth it."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Wow, this book was awful. I really don't understand why so many people have recommended it. And by ""people"" I mean authors and podcasters who focus on the themes of productivity and leadership. At first I thought it was me, I mean, I have a 9-5 job so I was thinking maybe I'm not committed enough to creativity to wake up and go to war with the ""Resistance,"" a force that exists in the world that the author says keeps us from creating. But then I thought, I really would rather befriend my creativity than wake up and feel like I have to go to battle every single day just to get something done. The author is talking mainly about procrastination, so maybe turning that into an external force that must be controlled is his best metaphor for dealing with this. But that's simply exhausting, plus, you'll never win. Sometimes the author would say really smart things, like ""Madonna does not identify with 'Madonna.' Madonna employs 'Madonna.'"" (p.86) -- meaning Madonna the person is a professional who is removed from her instrument so to speak, and that distance allows her to assess it and use it to her advantage. But he also said very odd and over-simplifying things, like, ""Doctors estimate that 70-80% of their business is non-health-related. People aren't sick, they're self-dramatizing."" (p.27) which is from a chapter titled Resistance and Victimhood. And then I got to Part Three of the book in which things go off the rails and the author talks about muses and angels, the ego and the self, and about how creating art is like giving birth. Boy, I hate it when anyone compares anything to giving birth. There's really nothing at all like giving birth, except, giving birth. While I read this book, I was reminded of Elizabeth Gilbert's awesome TED talk where she discusses muses and the need for a creative person to just show up to the job. And how just showing up, just sitting down and writing or composing or painting or choreographing is a valid and necessary use of one's time and energy, even if one never produces a masterpiece. And I also thought of Seth Godin's ""Linchpin"" and his Lizard Brain analogy to the tendency to not do creative work because it's, you know, hard. These two examples came after Pressfield's book, so I'm not suggesting his is derivative, just that his ideas are not unique. The first two parts of the book might be useful if you need a kick in the pants to quit procrastinating. But I do wonder if folks who tout this book never read the third part."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book had some very good bits of information and insight. Unfortunately, to get to these, you'd have to wade through a shit ton of pseudo-spiritual pretentiousness that ultimately boils down to working hard at your art and following the Muse (not selling out). Most of what is said here is neither new nor particularly interesting. It's just basic and regurgitated self-help stuff written in a very fancy and new-agey manner. I did like the author's personal anecdotes quite a lot, though, and found them encouraging, so the book wasn't a complete waste of time. Plus it's quite short. The author says at one point that he narrowly escaped becoming a fundamentalist (I'm paraphrasing here), and I can totally believe that that's true. Here's the actual quote: He seems to believe in all kinds of outlandish crap about artists being the vessels of some kind of heavenly dictum to bring forth the message of God and whatnot. I don't have a hard time picturing him seriously believing that humanity is fallen from some higher state of being and that people who wrote the stories of Adam and Eve (or the Bhagvad Gita) were inspired by God himself to jot his commandments down on paper. That seemed to be pretty much a central theme of the book, though not stated in so many words, that artists don't really create anything but only bring forth what already exists in another dimension. Or something to that effect. I was skimming through most of the weird spiritual parts. The third section of the book really did go off the deep end on this front, and the first one wasn't much better either as it only said some trite shit about personifying Resistance in a variety of very clichéd ways. If you only read the middle third of this book and nothing else, you'd get pretty much all the useful bits that it has to offer, which isn't much. Try it out if you have some extra time on your hands, I guess."

It's not the only one due to an opinion thinking there's anything wrong with self-help books. I am sure there are good ones and bad ones, and I definitely need help with all sorts of things. It's just the only one I've found that tackles one of the things wrong with me that I care enough about to want to fix or at least consider. The book is a quick read about creativity and the thousands of little things that we let keep us from actually creating. He is a successful novelist and has had at least one of his novels made into a film (Bagger Vance); I am willing to listen to the advice of anyone who's pulled off that trick. Pressfield is a masculine writer and it comes across in his advice as well, so I can see how this book might appeal to men more readily than women. Keep in mind he is trying to get you off your ass and past whatever resistance you may be fostering. The first section does an excellent job identifying the problems that keep us from creating and boils them down to a term--resistance. There were a lot of ""no shit"" moments for me here. The second section is a call to action, mostly by way of example and is also excellent. Toward the end there are parts where he gets a little abstract/mystical and he warns you, but there's wisdom here too and I think something to the idea of bad things tend to happen when we stifle our better desires. A good book to get you working."

He says the reason we procrastinate and never get down to doing what we feel we're meant to be doing or want to be doing is Resistance. He shows the many forms Resistance takes. And says we're at war with it. And at that point, I'm saying, ""Yes, yes. Absolutely right."" But then the next part of the book is supposed to be telling us how to combat Resistance. Isn't it? But it just meanders on about the difference between an Amateur and a Professional. And it all basically boils down to 'A writer writes.' and 'Put butt in chair'. Like I hadn't heard that before. Like I don't _know_ that. You haven't offered me any specific, detailed ways to beat Resistance. How do I sneak up on it? How do I trick it? How do I whittle away at it bit by bit? And then towards the end of the book he starts going on about Muses and Angels and spiritual crap. Until I felt like I was reading _The Secret_ all over again. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. But perhaps I can finally get around to reading The Art of War and name Resistance as my foe. And see if I come up with anything out of that."

I thought I would love it. It was recommended by some people I really trust. I found that it suffered tremendously from its writer's limited viewpoint as a white, male, older-generation writer. I don't often like to bring identity politics into things, but his position of entitlement, one he probably does not even know he occupies, colours his prose. It is and isn't as ""easy"" as he likes to make it. But he forgets his privileged position when he writes. He forgets everyone isn't him. He does refer to past hard times, but those do not seem to leave residual self-doubt, which is a huge stumbling block for the nascent artists I know. He does not particularly have a plan, and his suggestion of blocking out all else leads very strongly to forcing other people to pick up the pieces of your life around you, and leads to what I like to call binge-writing as opposed to writing as a lifestyle. The first part was better than the rest of the book -- it might leave you a bit inspired."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"One of the useful, profound books of my reading lifetime. I pull it out periodically just for the messages, the style, and the layout. Some readers apparently thought they didn't get their money's worth because the book is slim, and some pages contain only a paragraph or two. However, I've been an award-winning writer and newspaper editor for decades, and have just the opposite reaction. Believe me, it's much harder to write succinctly and effectively, and lay it out in such a way that each page supports the messages therin. The War of Art is brilliant in this regard, an example that should be studied by professorial types who write 1,000 page tomes on this same subject. As for Pressfield's constructs -- personalizing procrastination, calling on his Muse, etc., apparently you either buy into the metaphors or you don't. I'd say something disdainful about the literal-minded here, but I accept how they're wired. As for me, I find Pressfield's approach highly effective! Best regards, Mike"

It gives voice to thoughts I've always had but haven't acknowledged in years and years, too self-conscious, or discouraged, or ashamed: art as religion, as obligation. It's too bad that I needed someone else to give me permission to think that way again, but at least I got it back, yeah? Anyway I've seen a lot of reviews disparaging this book for its frou-frou ideas about angels and the Muse, and I just want to say that I can see how that might be off-putting for some people--heck, it's off-putting to me, to some extent--BUT he doesn't lean on it nearly so hard as some have said, and anyway I really believe that it pays sometimes to overlook the way someone frames the things he says, and dig for the meaning underneath. Holy cripes. This book! I highlighted it so hard on my Kindle that the poor thing crashed repeatedly. Then I special-ordered a hard copy so I can kiss it goodnight."

All of the ill-informed and unsubstantiated claims about medical issues like mental illness and cancer, the blatant oversimplification of history, and the idea of seeking/needing support as weakness? Yeah, nooo thank you, miss me with that bullshit.

It's full of very practical advice on how to rethink the common problems that stop us from doing what we know we want to. I honestly cannot recommend this book more. Just read it, it's hecka short.

I enjoyed this book and I've referred to it almost every week. For anyone who has creative battles in writing you will identify easily with Steven Pressfield in your face and humorous tone. This book helped me achieve certain writing goals I never seemed to get moving by motivating me to take action and realize the importance of my voice. Regardless of whether you’re trying to write a novel or screenplay, finish your artistic works, start a charity, start dieting or exercising, or even if you hope to run a marathon someday, this book is for all of you.. This book will help you identify the major bottlenecks preventing you from achieving your dreams. It will then help you overcome these obstacles, while helping you become more aware of the nature of the “enemy” for future battles. It’s primarily a motivational and philosophical book, but also contains some techniques to help you put everything together. However, it is not a step-by-step “how-to” kind of book. It’s more about understanding the psychology of creation, and how you can support it. The biggest concept/take away from this book is Steven’s label for the invisible force that seems to prevent us from achieving our goals. Using writing as an example, he states ""There’s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don’t, and the secret is this: It’s not the writing part that’s hard. What’s hard is sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance."" Using his “Resistance” concept, Steven splits up “The War of Art” into three sub-books. Book One deals with the concept of Resistance by defining what it is. Book Two deals with the techniques and mindset you can use to combat Resistance, now that you know what it is. Its main emphasis is on “turning pro” as a way of combating Resistance. Book Three has more of a spiritual element and tries to connect the previous books into one overriding whole. Besides Resistance, Steven also talks about his interpretation of concepts such as Genius, Muses, Angels, and the nature of hierarchical and territorial motivations. He somehow manages to link these all into one coherent whole, leaving you with a lot to ponder over. There are many great quotes in this book that is a must to re-read. This is highly recommend book for anyone who wants to combat the Resistance within them and wants to get starting achieving goals that you've maybe held off for some time. It is a easy fun read that is inspiring, motivational, funny, and honest. This book will also make you realize that the only person who is stopping you from completing goals is yourself."

The book is , and it almost feels like a summary of a much bigger book, so I'm glad that the author it. It's a quick read so you can often read it to get more inspired. The Resistance got in my way, so I read this for several months. :D Steven Pressfield's judgment in some places is a bit too much, and I can't entirely agree with all of it. Despite that, I enjoyed it a lot. The things he says make sense if you think about it. answers some questions like , - the latter is something specific to the context of the book (more can be read ) There is this part in the book about ""resistance and isolation"" - it was very well received from me in the time of COVID isolation.

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"As someone who has wanted to write for years but has actually finished very little, I found this book helpful. It’s divided into three sections, Resistance, Combating Resistance, and Beyond Resistance. In the first section the author defines resistance and the various ways it can get in the way of accomplishing creative endeavours. For example, that resistance cannot be seen, touched, or heard, but that it can be felt, that it will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. In the second section the author talks about what it means to be a professional versus being an amatuer. For example the amatuer only works when inspiration is felt, while the professional has some kind of schedule. Finally in the third section, the author explains that he believes that there are forces that we can call our allies. He is very upfront in telling the reader that he will be using terms like muses and angels. He adds that if that makes you uncomfortable, to feel free to think of angels in the abstract. I found this section to be a mixed bag. Some great ideas, some ideas that were kind of out there. I found the first two sections to be the most helpful. Identifying resistance and the many ways it can get in the way of creating was very eye-opening. Since the author gives so many examples I didn’t feel they all applied to me though. I highlighted the passages that I felt were most important. Another thing that I found helpful are the stories he tells of his struggles as a beginning writer. I feel that they do a good job of illustrating what he is trying to say. Although I don’t agree with everything that was presented and I’m skeptical of some of the ideas from the third section, I still liked the book. This isn’t for everyone. But for someone like me, who feels the urge to create but never gets around to finishing things. This book was helpful in identifying what’s been standing in the way and how to overcome it. If all you need, is to be aware that you need the discipline to get creative things done, you don’t need a book like this, you’re already knocking out novels and whatnot nonstop."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"An unusual guide to creativity that discourages navel gazing and instead suggests putting your ass in the chair. I was initially going to give this book four stars because the esoteric final section in which Pressfield discusses the source of creative inspiration put me off a bit. He discusses the Muses and angels, and I'm always skeptical of anything that involves little pink ponies or pixie dust. On further reflection, though, I see that Pressfield's theory that great works of art exist as intangible ideas in the universe, needing only the touch of us mere mortals to bring them to fruition, is just his way of explaining that strange state that anyone who is truly creative has experienced: The sense that we are not the actor; merely the instrument. I don't look for an explanation, I simply accept it. But when I consider that the ""Eroica"" and ""Guernica"" were definitely made by two flawed (very) human beings and yet undoubtedly belong to the ages, I begin to see the roots of this thinking. Also he quotes Blake, and Blake didn't merely have his finger in the river. He swam in it. I also like that Pressfield says (paraphrase): ""Amateurs are over-confident and cocky. Real artists are always scared to death."" I think this ties in to the earlier thought, because once we've had the experience of touching the river, we always worry that it will never come again. I think this is why so many creative types are self-destructive and perhaps why, to use a fairly recent example, DFW stopped taking his meds. They blocked the channel. Desperate to get back to that place, he took an action that ultimately cost him his life. In any case, I don't know what it is, but I know it exists; if Pressfield wants to call it angels or Muses, who am I to judge?"

This could easily be the best of the genre, who can say, how do you compare backwash? As soon as the topic sprawls into sociology/history/science/philosophy, we enter an opaque realm of regurgitated pop-psych myths, whitewashed history, authoritarian pseudo-Science, and “human nature” zealotry. There were glimmers of insight, like when the author touched on consumerism exploiting our thirst for instant gratification. But why didn't we start by defining/unpacking the social constructs that the entire book is based on: “work”, “art”, “inspiration”, “success”? Thankfully, this book is short; it did not have a chance to grow into a nauseating ordeal like Malcolm Gladwell’s “Outliers: The Story of Success”. (Side note: military “historians” are disturbing. Their uncritical fetishism of “warrior”, “glory”, “honour”, “hero”, “freedom”… talk about embracing Orwellian Newspeak and perpetuating war culture)"

With so many references to this book from other books, I assumed it has to be great. And looking at the Ratings, it should've been. So either it just went over my head, or people rate it high cause everyone else does, and successful people swear by it. Regardless, I found myself drifting most of the time, and couldn't focus on it at all. Ironic, since the book is trying to preach on how to concentrate / commit to something fully. Most of what is said, seems like common knowledge. And the book doesn't teach you techniques to overcome some of these obstacles, but rather just to be able to identity them. At least I now have the t-shirt, and can move swiftly along."

Ugh,no. This book perpetuates the myth that you can do it all if you just push yourself hard enough. Oh, and there's a heavy dose of proselytizing dumped over the top of it. Maybe some people will find this kind of internal war rhetoric motivating, but not me. It's toxic and shits on anyone who's tried to produce any kind of art while working through mental illness."

He does an excellent job of describing how our inner Resistance will present itself and what we can do to overcome it. As with most things, the answer is simple, but Pressfield does such an excellent job of succinctly laying it out in front of you. No extra fluff, no bullshit, no hack-ish behavior, just to the point (thank god). And while I do not believe in God, Pressfield’s use of God, angels, heaven, the Greek gods, and more were easily digestible as metaphors. And, honestly, has me questioning my beliefs a bit. There are reasons why ancient texts, stories, tales, and myths carry on for centuries. Our truth is out there. We just need to listen above, put in the work, and find it."

I downloaded a sample from Kindle to check it out and then immediately bought it in paperback. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is pursuing or wants to pursue a career in the arts, including writing novels. It feels like I underlined half the book out of violent agreement with what he was saying about managing the creative spirit. There were some spots where I violently disagreed, but I think he's 90% spot on. This book is similar to Napoleon Hill's 'Think and Grow Rich' and 'Outwitting the Devil' but without all the background context. I related to so much of it and it really helps with how to cope with the mental struggles of being an artist, in the arena, and how to keep up your game without getting discouraged. Author peeps - seriously. I can't recommend it enough. Health warning - the author is an ex-Marine, so expect some salty language."

The only success I have ever had with writing has come from putting my ass in a chair and squeezing each painful word out of my brain one letter at a time. Pressfield's determination is inspiring. I'm more moved by his failures than his successes. His insights into Resistance and the mollycoddling excuses we give s to insulate ourselves from rejection are dead on. I feel a revival preacher peering down from the pulpit staring straight at my naked artistic soul. Some of Pressfield's more spiritual assertions still strike me as dubious, but considerably less so than when I read this book for the first time ten years ago. I believe in Resistance. Perhaps, it follows, there is a corollary force for good. Perhaps there is a Muse. All I know is that being professional, squeezing, showing up on time until the work is done, is the only way I will ever get this work done. Sing to me oh Muse..."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A mostly mundane, at times contradictory read on how to muster up the dedication to commit to your craft as a Professional and overcome various barriers of amateurism (""Resistance""), with an intriguing spiritual/transcendental exploration at the end. I was recommended this book by a full-time standup comic I've gotten to know, who suggested I read this as inspiration on how to take my own comedy (currently still very much in amateur/hobby territory) to the next level. Unfortunately, my main takeaway was that perhaps I'm just not personally ready for a ""professional"" level of commitment yet -- as the ideas in this book, while at times illuminating of a perspective I don't hold, just didn't resonate very closely with me. I didn't feel, upon reading this book, to be ready to Actually, I suspect that there will be a time when this book does speak to me. But I think comedy is an interesting art in that there is a lot of built-in gratification. Performing a standup set, even at an open mic, tends to come with a lot of immediate feedback from strangers, which I find to be quite thrilling and energizing. So even as an amateur, I find myself motivated, with each set, to keep pushing at my comedy, and I've intentionally set a low bar for my commitment to the craft so as to not put too much pressure on myself. The book is laid out into three parts. First, Pressfield defines ""Resistance"" - the force, in the vein of procrastination or writer's block, which can keep us from engaging in creative pursuits. He sets up this foundation of the Amateur who only looks at their pursuit as a hobby, as someone who can easily fall victim to Resistance. In Book 2, Pressfield digs into the phenomenon of ""Turning Pro."" The pro Turning Pro, he suggests, is ultimately just a simple It's about focusing on technique; about not being overly invested in one's success. This second section was where I felt like some of the contradictions started to come into play. I felt like there were two threads that got muddled; one was around seriousness - that the Pro takes their art seriously, rather than just treating it like a hobby. But then he also talks about avoiding over-identification with the art - about how the Pro distances themselves from their instrument. Basically, there's a Professional level of detachment that to me doesn't fully square with being sufficiently committed to the art to consider oneself a Pro. I think maybe it comes down to - some perspectives are necessary to get into the right mindset when embarking as a Pro, and some perspectives are necessary to persevere as a Pro. But I don't think Pressfield separated those two phenomena very well. In the final Book, Pressfield really surprised me by musing on the distinction between the Ego and the Self that reminded me more of philosophy and even of Buddhism. The Self, Pressfield opines, believes that All beings are one, that God is all there is. Basically, Pressfield's distinction is that the Amateur is driven by their Ego whereas the Professional lives more in the Self, and almost doesn't believe in the Ego as a distinct entity. I'll revisit this idea in a future read because I'm intrigued by it; that by fully embracing the non-dualistic Self, the artist opens themselves up to being struck by Divine Inspiration. So, Pressfield argues, by choosing to be a Professional and giving up various Amateurish perspectives that tend to cause me to obsess over my self-worth, I will be more likely to overcome Resistance, to overcome the Fear I have of succeeding and accessing my inner powers, and, perhaps, to Transcend. Again, my take is basically... ""neat"". I don't yet feel Divine Inspiration when I write jokes, but it sure is cool that Pressfield does when he writes. Maybe some day :)"

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I can see why this is a love it/hate it book. I LOVED it through and through and through. I bet my brothers would toss it aside. We are all in business for ourselves. But how we see business is vastly different. They come at it from the logical, analytical, structured approach. I come at it from a more romantic, poetic, and soulful approach. Now, I'll add this. All three of us siblings are ridiculously successful and financially comfortable and in what the outside world would consider ""serious professions"" for ourselves. Yet my approach works as well as theirs. What does this have to do with the War of Art? You will ONLY get this book if you are in touch with the inner struggle, if you are aware enough to know that such a thing as Resistance, the evil that Pressfield talks about, is in all of us if we are aiming to elevate our lives, and then this book will be the symphony you've waited to hear all your creative life. The War of Art is divided into three Books. Book 1 - Resistance, Defining the Enemy, followed by Book 2 -Combating Resistance, Turning Pro, followed by Book 3 - Beyond Resistance, The Higher Realm (my absolute favorite of all three Books). In these short, punchy chapters, and in succinct powerful phrases, Pressfield gives us the real story that goes on inside each of us creative types: We wake up every day, dreaming of our dream, and battling resistance to do the work to get to our dream. What do we need to do to overcome Resistance one more day, and what exactly happens when we go into that zone - the creative genius zone, the zone where we are free to create, time dissolves, the linear dimension gives way to a higher plane of existence even if for 10 minutes, and we find our purpose, we hear and follow our calling, we give all that we've got, unattached to the fruits of our labors but committed as hell to the work in the process. A freaking symphony, I tell you. Pick up this book. Read it, and then read it again. If you can beat resistance, you can do anything. And you CAN beat resistance. Just do what Pressfield tells you, and what he tells you, you already know. You may be hearing it for the first time but you know it. We all know what we need to do to fulfill the vision and live the dream. It's Resistance we have to beat to get to work. Some of my favorite quotes: It's not the writing that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance. The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist. There is no mystery to turning pro. It's a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that. The Knights of the Round Table were chase and self-effacing. Yet they dueled dragons. We're facing dragons too. Fire-breathing griffins of the soul, whom we must outfight and outwit to reach the treasure of our self-in-potential and to release the maiden who is God's plan and destiny for ourselves and the answer to why we were put on this planet."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Part 1 - Really interesting/insightful information on resistance. Part 2 - Aggressive 'talking to.' ( And advice/opinions I absolutely disagreed with.) Part 3 - A bunch of his personal religious values & constricted rules/ideas. Started off strong but ended up being so poor. It actually made me pretty angry. Pressfield promotes and even glorifies the 'suffering artist' role. There is even a chapter called 'how to be miserable.' And says in order to be taken seriously or professionally as a writer, you have to be like a Marine. Here is an extract for example: 'Marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction from having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces, swab jockeys or flyboys, all of whom they despise. Why? Because these candy-asses don't know how to be miserable. The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not. He will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation. The artist must be like that Marine. He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable. He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier or swabbie or jet jockey. Because this is war, baby. And war is hell.' Firstly, Pressfield must have some serious issues going on in his own writing methods because he compares the process of writing to war. That is an extremely powerful and negative adjective to use to describe the process of something that should be enjoyable. Secondly, he essentially bullies the reader into feeling that if they want to be taken seriously as a 'professional' writer then they must 'take pride in being miserable' or must commit to 'volunteering to hell.' Both of which promote a very unhealthy way of thinking. I'll say it louder for the people in the back. YOU CAN ENJOY WRITING. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SUFFER. YOU CAN ENJOY WHAT YOU DO. YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR CAREER. And if people don't take you seriously because your not miserable or bragging about how your 'trilogy is soooo hard right now' - then you don't need that kind of negativity in your life! It's okay to be excited about your wip or that painting your crafting right now. It's okay to share with others how happy/grateful you are to do this as a profession. This annoyed me for many reasons but mainly because he is promoting an unhealthy mindset and lifestyle. Of which could cause a damaging effect. But it felt to me that because the author did not already know this himself. He shouldn't be giving out advice that could cause harm. Yes, there were some good lines in there and insightful information on resistance in the first part. But overall, it felt like the blind leading the blind. A perpetual cycle of unhealthy madness. So if you do read this book, please know that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE MISERABLE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST/WRITER/ OR CREATOR! I would have given it 2 stars but the way it crashed & disappointed me, I just couldn't."

As an artist is always at some sort of war with himself/herself and I wanted to understand more about that. Although the principle described in this book can be applied to entrepreneurs, the main target audience of this book are Aspiring Writers, Singers, Musicians, other artists, basically creative persons who have lots of creative talent in them, but somehow are not turning that potential into actual creative work. This book is divided into 3 parts: 1. Resistance (The primary enemy of any creative person) and how it manifests itself in different forms 2. How to overcome that resistance by turning Pro. 3. How to go on to a higher plane Some key points that caught my attention: 1. The Writer's Muse (So far, I have only heard that term, but now I understand and relate to it) 2. The Writer's Muse can be activated only by doing Work and lots of it. 3. How to get Creative Inspiration. The book is more philosophical than practical. However, I would recommend to this every budding artist. After reading this book, I thought I should have read this book before. And I am certain that many more readers of this book would have felt the same way. I think that's the hallmark of a good book. Negatives: As already told, this book is more philosophical. So it won't give any practical tips if you face any obstacles. It is upto you to figure it out. Sometimes it's preachy but I think the overall impact is much positive and will have a long term impact on artists. Conclusion: I feel this book must be read multiple times to understand the full essence of the book and what the author is trying to convey. So I have marked it for reading again. (Mind you, I am not a voracious reader). I am sure I will get newer lessons each time I read it."

Yet, I think this work would be better served as a long pamphlet or a monograph rather than a book. The key message is that ""resistance"" is a natural component of doing meaningful things. Rather than seeing resistance as some strange anomaly to be avoided, resistance has to be embraced as a necessary component of creating worthy art. The first two parts of the book address this in a ""define the problem, various ways to deal with the problem"" format. The last part of the book, featuring references to Zeus and the ""muses"" was a bit much for me, and can easily be skipped in favor of the first two parts of the book, which carry a good message for those who are perhaps just starting out on a writing/entrepreneurial journey, and either have an underdeveloped sense of discipline or unreasonable expectations about how the entrepreneurial journey will proceed. ""Resistance obstructs movement only from a lower sphere to a higher. It kicks in when we seek to pursue a calling in the arts, launch an innovative enterprise, or evolve to a higher station morally, ethically, or spiritually."" ""Adversity, injustice, bad hops and rotten calls, even good breaks and lucky bounces all comprise the ground over which the campaign must be waged. The field is level, the professional understands, only in heaven."" ""We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become. We are who we are from the cradle, and we're stuck with it. Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it."""

What is resistance? Well, Steven dedicated this book to explaining what that force is, and how to conquer it. He explains that resistance is the force which doesn't let us become our greatest selves. The good news is, that it's entirely in us. It IS us, or the part of our psyche that he calls the ego. Every one of us experiences resistance towards our creative pursuits. This point needs to be emphasized more. EVERY one of us. Even the ones you think as geniuses. Yes, they are geniuses, but not because they were born with some extraordinary capacities or some superhuman brains. No, one of the things that they did was that they learned how to deal with resistance. If they didn't, we wouldn't have the 5th Symphony, The Great Pyramids, The Mona Lisa, etc. It's in our capabilities to slay this dragon, which keeps us from getting that holy grail which is at the end of our journey. And as Joseph Campbell said, we are the hero of this journey, and it's our responsibility to do so. Pressfield also differentiates the two approaches of doing your art: hierarchical and territorial. The difference is that hierarchical approach doesn't work, because it's focused on how your art affects your hierarchical level in society, whereas with the territorial approach you are solely interested in doing your craft, for its own sake, and not for the approval of any kind. In short, this is a must-read for anyone who creates something."

It's ""the Resistance"" - a force for mediocrity coiled around the human spirit. In THE WAR OF ART Steven Pressfield hunts down the predatory monster that scares us away from our best selves, puts that beast in the crosshairs, and aims for its heart. Now YOU have to pull the trigger. Written from his vantage point as a novelist/screenwriter, this semi-autobiography is a fascinating and entertaining book of success, expressed at levels profane (literally) and sublime. If you have a project you've been trying to finish, a dream you've been putting off, a passion you haven't yet manifested into the world, here's your chance to identify what's REALLY holding you back and get a strategy for dealing with it. This is not a self-help book in the mold of 7 Habits or 12 Steps. It's more a wake-the-hell-up-and-get-moving book. Pressfield gives you permission to be your best self and the responsibility to do the work necessary. This might turn some people off - BUT everyone who feels stuck should read it because the PERSONALITY he assigns to ""the Resistance"" - that soul-sucking force that shows up when we start to shine - is a real eye-opener."

And yes, they are there — some chapters of this book have certainly pulled a few ""oh, come on, seriously"" out loud moments out of my mouth. But the good chapters, those are true, genuine gold, often blending seamlessly self-help reasoning with creative inspiration and a dash of cultural ethics in the same bundle. It ranges from the very light and shallow to the holy-crap-where-did-this-come-from very quickly, so it may be a bit of an odd read for some. What I love most this book, and the reason why it's leaving with 4 stars, is the very helpful metaphor it uses throughout its entirety: this idea of ""Resistance"", as if it was this organic, living being who's preventing us from achievement what essentially needs to be done. Since then, I've already starting to think differently about my energy levels and motivations to get things done; measuring them in ""Resistance"" levels and asking about what's making them so high/low, has been tremendously helpful already. The tiny chapter of feeding our own territory is worthy of a short movie on its own, and it's something I'll carry with me for a long while."

Makes you look into your life and clearly see the things you know deep down but overlook. Pressfield shares his experiences and profound views about work, relationships and how our inner forces try to get hold of us. His point is that it is resistance that doesn't want us to become our greater selves because if we do there won't be the space left for it to confront us anymore. I like his comparison of professional and amateur artists and creators and how 'easy' and difficult it is to be professional and DO the work. But it is very motivating, because as the author himself says that when we sit down day after day and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen... Unseen forces enlist in our cause; muse takes note of our dedication, she approves... When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete. I'm sure I will read this book at least once more. It is a must read not just for 'creative' workers but EVERYONE in general who wishes to understand and get to know forces that are deeply involved while creating or trying/wanting to create."

It's easy to read, with many pages having only one paragraph of text (which meant I could write lots of notes and process right on the pages themselves! bonus!) Pressfield talks extensively about Resistance-- the thing that keeps us from doing the very things we were created to do. Basically, I decided that Resistance is Satan's alter ego-- he hates when we try to do the things the Lord gifted and called us to, and will do anything and everything in his power to keep us from it. This book was a swift kick in the pants and a big motivational speech all at once. No matter who you are, this book will speak to you.

His writing, in “The War of Art” is episodic and reads like a set of blog posts. “The War of Art” is a book about breaking the barriers that limit us from being creative.

And it's not just for artistic endeavors. I didn't read it for that reason. It brings into consciousness the force that seems to be fighting anyone who is fighting to achieve something. I suppose Pressfield's anthropomorphic descriptions of that force were useful, but as I got further and further into the book, I found it harder to follow his thoughts. He is attempting to evoke symbols that may be larger than this book, and he does this through narrowly-defined religious views and bastardized Jungian psychology."

The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Pressfield is best known as the author of some very well regarded historical novels about Sparta. This book of writing advice is focused on the psychology of the labor of writing. If you are a true Artist (caps intended), with a Great Work inside you, it will take real, painful effort to get it out. There's a fear inside us, preventing us from achieving our great work, which Pressfield deems Resistance. True artists face their Resistance every day, and win. You can no more ultimately conquer Resistance than you can death, but every word written is another victory. Pressfield's recipe for beating resistance is turning professional. The world is full of amateur hobbyists, but the professional faces up to resistance every day and does the work that needs to be done. A professional carves out that space, both psychological and physical, that enables them to work. And if you're working, really working, emotional satisfaction will follow. As the Bhagavad Gita teaches, we're entitled only to our labor, not the fruits of our labor. It's interesting to compare Pressfield to Cameron's The two books are more similar than different. Both seek to tap an authentic artist's self to conquer the false demons of the ego. But where Cameron follows the radical presentness of Zen, Pressfield argues for transcendent inspiration, in the framework of the Greek Muses. The cool professional is a different take from the enlightened master, but the content and style of punchy chapters is similar. With my military history orientation, I prefer Pressfield's take. Of course, those seeking the mechanics of writing should look elsewhere."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"American author and screenplay writer, Steven Pressfield employs a spontaneous and freewheeling method of writing in his book “The War of Art”, whose quintessential objective is to facilitate overcoming internal blocks that impeded creativity. Terming such blocks as “Resistance”, Pressfield boldly proclaims that the difference between the life that remains unlived and the mundane life that is otherwise being led, is Resistance. This pernicious element of Resistance prevents one from channeling her true potential and consequently breaking through the mould of an existence mired in the prosaic. “The War of Art” is divided into three parts. The first part articulates the nature and force of the Resistance itself and the myriad ways in which it works to usurp optimism and confidence. Part two of the book titled “Going Pro”, deals with some ways using which the motives of Resistance may be trumped. Once the power of Resistance wanes, one is on her way to finally becoming a pro. The third and final part of the book meanders about invoking the Muse. Pressfield being a believer equates the Muse with a divine unseen energy that gives wings to hope and allows the artist to soar higher and higher. However, Pressfield acknowledges the fact that a non-believer or a skeptic need not think about the Muse as Providence, but as a latent albeit benevolent force that harnesses eager and sincere ambitions before putting them on the path to fruition. Penned in the form of verses, “The War of Art” is thought provoking, intuitive and engaging. At times funny and at others, sombre, the book sure lends multiple points to ponder. But the book also gives the impression that enormous reliance and confidence needs to be placed on the Almighty even if one possesses an abundance of talent, for nothing can be more disastrous than disappointing one’s Muse. The moment that happens, you can be sure your goose is cooked. “Angels work for God. It's their job to help us. Wake us up. Bump us along. Angels are agents of evolution. The Kabbalah describes angels as bundles of light, meaning intelligence, consciousness. Kabbalists believe that above every blade of grass is an angel crying ""Grow! Grow!"" I'll go further. I believe that above the entire human race is one super-angel, crying ""Evolve! Evolve!"" Angels are like muses. They know stuff we don't. They want to help us. They're on the other side of a pane of glass, shouting to get our attention. But we can't hear them. We're too distracted by our own nonsense. Ah, but when we begin.” So it comes as no surprise that there are repeated references to the Chapter on Karma Yoga from the immortal Hindu epic of The Bhagavad Gita. The exhortations of Lord Krishna to the confused and exasperated warrior prince, Arjuna, to just concentrate on his labour and duty and leave the rest to Providence is at the edifice of Pressfield’ s solution to smashing Resistance. Resistance, Pressfield argues is a toxic force, an enemy within. Not amenable to compromise or open to negotiations, Resistance is an implacable force that has a singular unwavering, unyielding and unchangeable objective – destroying success or even the very thought of success. Resistance never ever tires in this destructive objective and unless tackled through clever means, goes on its rampaging merry ways till its aims are fulfilled. Pressfield argues that Resistance thrives on bad habits. A perennial favourite and a most trustworthy ally of Resistance is procrastination. Similarly, If we find ourselves unduly leveling criticism at others, this means that we are squarely in the grip of Resistance. “When we see others beginning to live their authentic selves, it drives us crazy if we have not lived out our own. Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement. Watch yourself. Of all the manifestations of Resistance, most only harm ourselves. Criticism and cruelty harm others as well.” Pressfield also holds that dreams can have an optimistic and positive impact on an artist’s innermost self and can spur her on towards greater glories. “My friend Carol had the following dream, at a time when her life felt like it was careening out of control: She was a passenger on a bus. Bruce Springsteen was driving. Suddenly Springsteen pulled over, handed Carol the keys, and bolted. In the dream Carol was panicking. How could she drive this huge rolling Greyhound? By now all the passengers were staring. Clearly no one else was gonna step forward and take charge. Carol took the wheel. To her amazement, she found she could handle it. Later, analyzing the dream, she figured Bruce Springsteen was ""The Boss."" The boss of her psyche. The bus was the vehicle of her life. The Boss was telling Carol it was time to take the wheel. More than that, the dream, by actually setting her down in the driver's seat and letting her feel that she could control the vehicle on the road, was providing her with a simulator run, to prime her with the confidence that she could actually take command in her life. A dream like that is real support. It's a check you can cash when you sit down, alone, to do your work.” In order to over Resistance one needs to be a professional. By professional we mean not in the sense, which is attributable in the perspective of defining careers, but in a more contextual manner. Going pro means loving what one does to such an extent so as to transcend being an amateur and stay dedicated for the rest of one’s lives. This is the love which Tiger Woods possesses for golf, an untamed, unsatisfied and unquenchable thirst for the game and to be at it every single day of his life. Pressfield also provides examples of his own life where he made the transition from nadir to zenith in a painstaking but persevering manner. With only a beat up Chevy, a cat (“Mo”) and his antique Smith-Corona, Pressfield progressed to being one of the most successful screenplay writers overcoming a plethora of relentless obstacles. “The War of Art” – undoubtedly thought provoking."
The War of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I actually tried to read this book once before a few years ago and got maybe 20-30 pages in, but stopped because I thought it was stupid and one of those bullshit-y vague type personal development book that really promises a lot but doesn't deliver much. Boy, was I wrong. I was probably too immature and inexperienced in life (me, immature? never) at the time to actually appreciate what I was reading, combined with the fact that my dad tried to get me to read it and for whatever reason when I'm forced/coerced into reading a book (be it for school or otherwise) it becomes more of a chore and less enjoyable. But after reading this book fully and trying to digest its contents (which I'm still doing), I can tell you without a doubt that I will reread this book at least a couple more times and I will be reading more of Pressfield's work. Anyway, on to the book itself. I devoured it in a couple days, not only because it was a short (163 pages if I recall) and easy read but because it was so damn interesting. In the first part, book one, Pressfield introduces what he calls ""Resistance"", which is essentially anything and everything that keeps us from doing those things we dream about doing, be it starting a business venture, writing a book, whatever. He talks about its many forms (fear of criticism, procrastination, and so on), giving us a good idea of what exactly we are up against, because after all, you cannot defeat an enemy that you don't recognize. Book two starts to give you an idea of what exactly separates those who can overcome resistance (pros) from those who cannot (amateurs), and while Pressfield gives many examples (such as Tiger Woods, back when we was known solely for golf), you should be able to look into your own life and see examples of this in others and maybe even yourself. Book three gets into a more philosophical and even pseudo-religious description of inspiration, but you'll find he's right on the money with his description. To paraphrase a bit and give my own example, think of a time when you had to write a paper for school. You had a topic, and maybe even a rough outline/idea of the paper, but you had no earthly idea where to start with it. You probably stared at the blank screen for a while (of course with ""breaks"" to check your favorite websites), but at one point you said ""fuck it"" and just started typing. And it sucked, but it got you moving. And slowly but surely, the ideas starting coming to you rapidly, and you threw them down on paper (screen), only to later go back and clean it up and make it presentable. This was essentially Pressfield's premise, that you shouldn't wait for inspiration, but start and let inspiration find you. And this reminded me of two things that I've seen elsewhere. The first, an talking about just starting and then letting an idea/inspiration/whatever find you, and the other was I think from Stephen King (I've also heard of Seinfeld doing the same with jokes) that I'm sure most people on this site have probably heard about. The writing 500 words/a page/whatever a day, like clockwork. Doesn't matter if it's good or shit, just do it, and over time you'll get better and have decent material. Just show up every day, put an effort it, and some days will be good, some bad, most average (I've found the same applies to the gym and lifting weights, but will save y'all from reading what you will most likely think is a boring tangent). Now, that's not all that was covered in the last third of this book, but that's the part that stood out the most to me simply because I am reigning world champion of procrastination (I should be working on schoolwork and looking for internships as I type this). He relates this to Muses and angels, and even uses the term ""infinite intelligence"", which is familiar to those of you who have read (another book I highly recommend). Personally, I'm not sure that I believe in Muses and angels the way Pressfield does, I actually have my own theory that some of the ideas, connections, and epiphanies that seemingly come to us from nowhere are actually from the subconscious part of our brain that was processing something and finally made us aware of it, rather than a supernatural entity from a higher plane gracing us with an idea. That said, Pressfield wasn't necessarily describing all of this literally either, and whether or not you or I believe it exactly as he lays it out, there is truth in the ideas he is presenting. In short, the three main parts of this book are as follows: Resistance (that which stands in our way on any potential creative endeavor), what is different about various pros that overcome Resistance, and how exactly we should get inspiration so that we, too, can become a pro like those described in book two. I recommend this book to pretty much everyone, as it's a short and easy read, but if you really think about the topics presented in it, I think you will benefit from it. I'd file the contents of this book under the category of things you don't really think about, but when you're made aware of them you think ""holy shit, how did I miss that, it's so obvious"". This isn't the type of book you can throw up on your shelf and be all pseudo-intellectually about to your friends, but worth the read nonetheless."

If you want to be more creative and need a pep talk I would totally recommend this with a really enormous grain of salt."

This book however is… something else. I love the title and I think it was very interesting to read. But the format of the chapters feels more like button poetry (no rhyming though). The ideas presented are very “fantastical”, talking about a muse and some inner force that wants to stop you from letting that muse let the idea of the gods flow through you… a little weird. I would definitely not sort this in “non-fiction”, it feels more like high fantasy at times. Some sentences are also quite racist/against certain religions. I think that could bother some people. All in all, it was an interesting perspective. But I hoped to have a more scientific approach to why we procrastinate and how to stop it by rationalizing it. I still somehow enjoyed the approach in this book, it was just a little weird."

I had a couple issues with it. To begin with, if you look at the front of this book, the only author listed is Frida Khalo. The other authors list themselves only in conjunction with the introduction. Imagine my surprise when I opened this book to discover that Fuentes not only translates into English all Kahlo's written notes, but also includes pages of ""translation"" through his own lenses of history and experience every single word that she writes. Reading Fuentes's insights isn't a wholly negative experience, I found, but it does skew the encounter with Kahlo's very personal document. I do think this interference should be made clear to readers considering this book for purchase, for those individuals who don't so much interpretation. And also, because Fuentes needed space to provide his notes to accompany each of the pages, the book has an odd layout, with all the translations and ""translations"" lumped at the back of the book rather than facing each relevant page. This design makes the reading experience quite awkward. Aside from these issues, I did love reading Frida's diary, as she is my favorite artist. Reading her diary inspired me, even despite the design issues, and I'm planning a project of my own around this reading. So excited!

Lowe that preface the diary entries are impressive. Frida Kahlo suffered much though her life - stricken by polio at seven, a bus accident where she broke her pelvis bone, spinal column, and had other serious injuries at 18 years old, over 20 operations, the affairs and divorce (then remarriage) of Diego Rivera, her inability to have children because of her injuries, and the eventual amputation of her leg. However, she loved life, painting, and Diego Rivera despite her pain and losses. For the last ten years of her life from 1944 - 1954, she kept a diary filled with her reflections and artwork. This is a complete full-color replica of her diary with color, ink blots, bleeding through pages, faded and vivid cursive writing, cross-outs, and remains of torn pages. At the end is an explanation and translation of her work. Her painted diary was intended to be private yet we see the “artist unmasked.” A fascinating insight into the workings of her mind in her final decade. Would this Mexican icon, who bared herself and her soul in her art, have wanted the world to know her innermost thoughts?"

Then again, if you already know Frida Kahlo you wouldn't really expect that, would you? Originally not intended to be published, through Kahlo's diary you get inside her head in the form of letters, notes, automatic writing and sketches. So much so, that you feel a bit rude for invading her thoughts. I don't claim to understand automatic writing, and even though Frida isn't a Surrealist, she occasionally seems to be using the same technique in her writings. I'm so far only visually into Surrealism, so for me those passages were the most difficult and confusing. But in the whole, is the diary really meant to be understood by someone other than her? Frida's writings and pictures together create a beautiful chaos, that helps you get a little bit closer to her art. Even you didn't understand everything, you can still feel the emotions that Frida went through when her health slowly deteriorated, and the love she had for Diego and pre-Columbian symbolism and culture. If you already admire Frida's art, this is a must read and a real gem of a companion piece to her paintings. The book itself had a little problematic layout, because the explanations and translations are all stuffed into the back of the book, forcing you to flip through the pages. The Finnish translation also had quite a bit of problems in terms of spelling. Not a huge thing, but stuff like that always sticks out when it's repeated a few times."

I thought it was going to be a basic translated version of Frida Kahlo's diary with a brief introduction of some kind about her and her life, It isn't. This book begins with a long larbourious introduction which, I felt, at times strays completely from Kahlo and can be very hard to follow. And then there is a full essay on the contents and format of Kahlo's diary. So before you get to view any of her work or her thoughts you've already been pounded with what two other people think about her and the diary itself. Then you have the diary which is in full colour and detail (the only good bit of this book) But the way the translation have been done is really awkward in as much as all the translation are grouped together at the end of the book with the commenttary of the person who did the introduction. So intead of having the diary on one page and the translation on the opposite page so that you could glance and compare between the two with ease, you have to flick back and forth to find the right translation for the right page while also figuring out what is the direct translation of Kahlo's word and what are actually the opinions and thoughts of someone else that have been put in there already. I felt like I had no space ''reading'' this book. I didn't enjoy it. there is a relatively simple timeline at the end of the book which I though was interesting but other then that not much else . The book disects every part of Frida Kahlo leaving no space for you have have your own thoughts, feelings or discoveries. Love Frida, Hated the book."

I can kind of understand why, for example, all of the translation is at the end of the book, so as not to interrupt the flow of the diary itself, but it could have been done more elegantly so that it's not so hard to find the translation of the page you're looking at. A better option might have been to have all the commentary and translation in a separate volume, and/or make some kind of online component to go with the diary now that we live in the future. Color coded page edges? Really, anything would be better than how it's laid out now. But, when you get down to it, complaining about having to flip pages back and forth is what I think some might call a ""first world problem."" It doesn't ruin the experience, just makes it clunky."

And, of course, Frida will journal in her own artistic way. Some may find it difficult to read, because of the language barrier, because of her honesty in her pain & rage & beeeecause the love that did not die & because we see & feel the sadness that this love wrought upon her. I lost myself in the Spanish. Her words ring so beautifully. I kept re reading & repeating outloud: 'Se equivocó la paloma - Se equivocaba ~~~ ' By the time she writes this, she has now lost her right foot to the gangrene that continued to plague her for years. Now the foot must come away. She draws images of the foot. The sore marked foot, the leg attached to the foot that keeps it attached to her body. And then the foot alone. Blood. Pain. Casts. A painting of her body wrapped, wrapped & simply one belt holding this all together. And so she paints: Images of a body broken through out the diary. Images of the beautiful moment that is life through out her diary. Water. Horse. Dogs. Birds. Words to Diego, who we know has gone. Words of love - that show how much this love is still real for her. Pain. Emotional. Physical. It is not a conventional journal. It is rife with emotion. Frida's emotion. It is difficult to read, but the pages are so colourful. Her words never lose their courage nor strength. She remains Frida Kahlo. She is self aware of her own importance & so she continues even in illness & pain to create. I read this with a touch of sadness, she should have lived to be 90 or 100. She would have continued to create. She would know her place in the world that is ART & she would know of her importance in this world. She would never doubt it. This is an excellent companion to those who love Ms. Kahlo. Carlos Fuentes does an excellent job. He translates for those who need it. So.... read this book. And I quote from page 287 "" Few artists have had the audacity to picture their own departure from this world, but then few faced death on so regular a basis. Never had the often-quoted statement by Kahlo seemed more appropriate: "" I never painted dreams ~~~~ I painted my own reality "" ~~☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~ ☆~~~~~"

Frida Kahlo kept a illustrated diary for the last ten years of her life. She also kept it locked up and private. Yet, here it is in the hands of the public - people she didn't even know. Is that not an invasion of privacy? And yet, I'm so glad this exists and is available for us to flip through. Like I said, I'm conflicted about this one. What I am not conflicted about is how lovely this book is. The production, color, and paper quality are all superb. Many have complained about how the book is laid out, but I think it was done just right. Yes, you have to flip back and forth between her diary pages, and the translations and commentary in the back, but that also enables you to see how her actual diary looked in its entirety - albeit with some pages clearly torn out. Unlike diarists who write for public consumption, this was a private one, so much of it makes no sense to the reader, and that is as it should be. The commentary does a good job of giving us context and connecting dots, but we are not Frida so cannot really understand all that we see and read. She was a remarkable woman and artist, and to get the opportunity to flip through a copy of her journal is a gift. With sincerest apologies to Ms. Kahlo."

The introduction by Carlos Fuentes is challenging but worth putting in the effort to read twice-thrice to really understand it. The faithful reproductions of the pages from Kahlo's diary--an art journal before there was such a trend!--through to bled-through inks and coffee stains are PHENOMENAL. The back end of the book contains translations of the pages--which is a great aid for non-Spanish readers--and contextualizations, which, em, I don't know--in some cases, I could have done without. Regardless: I adore this book. The person who gifted it to me has my eternal gratitude. If you are looking for a gift for a Kahlo lover, this is perfect. And if you love Kahlo... you already own it yourself, don't you?"

The introduction by Carlos Fuentes is a poetic overview of her life, written possibly more for artists or students of art than the general reader. Even so, I recommend reading it. The bulk of this very heavy hardcover book are color photographs/reproduction of Kahlo’s diary. Most of the entries are not dated and her entries are sporadic. The last 40 pages or so are the English translations of her entries as well as an explanation of the Aztec images and symbolism Kahlo liked to employ. Sarah Lowe, who also has an essay in the book, provides the written discussion about the diary texts and images. Kahlo sketched and painted many images on the pages of her diary and many are startling, beautiful, unsettling and disturbing. Kahlo is a woman who painted her own physical disintegration and the pictures in the diary may have been the last paintings she ever did, paintings of her own death. If you are at all interested in the life and art of Frida Kahlo, I highly recommend this. Even though I have read a number of books about her and have been lucky enough to see her paintings at two traveling expeditions (Philadelphia Museum of Art and the AGO in Toronto), this book greatly expanded my appreciation of the woman and her art."

Croatian writer Slavenka Drakulic recently also wrote one documentary novel about famous Mexican painter called: ""Frida Kahlo or about pain"". As you can see, the pain and suffering of that great artist after traffic accident and high artistic fruits of her struggle for life, through so many hospital operations, serves as inspiration for many writers. After so many others talked and wrote about her, finally this is her personal diary about the last ten years of her turbulent life. The diary contains words and scenes from Frida's passionate relationship of love and hate with her huband, celebrated painter as well, her thoughts, poems and especially Frida's dreams which were well-known source of inspiration for her surrealist paintings. As in every monographical book of that kind dozens of illustrations, self-portraits, unfinished sketches and finished paintings present her creative process from basic idea to completed work of art. Highly recommended to read such an intimate confession of a woman who was real heroine, successfully overwhelming so hard difficulties and tragic accidents of her life, that majority of us will never have to meet."

I painted my own reality "" Originally never intended to be published, “The Diary Of Frida Kahlo” provides a deeply intimate and emotionally raw insight into the mind of one of the greatest (in my opinion) artists of the 20th century. The shear passion, creativity and endurance that fuel these pages, quite frankly makes it utterly impossible to rate. So instead I’ll let the work and writing speak for it self: “I’ll try out the pencils sharpened to the point of infinity which always sees ahead: Green — good warm light Magenta — Aztec. old TLAPALI blood of prickly pear, the brightest and oldest Brown — colour of mole, of leaves becoming earth Yellow — madness sickness fear part of the sun and of happiness Blue — electricity and purity love Black — nothing is black — really nothing Olive — leaves, sadness, science, the whole of Germany is this colour Yellow — more madness and mystery all the ghosts wear clothes of this colour, or at least their underclothes Dark blue — colour of bad advertisements and of good business Blue — distance.

Thankfully, after coming out, I was reintroduced to her through a queer Latinx lens, one that refused to let Frida be seen as a sidekick but rather as the astonishing artist, revolutionary, and radical she was on her own (the greater of the two, if you ask me). Not surprisingly, I now can’t get enough of her, and I’ve since devoured anything I can get my hands on that touches on her life. That’s why Jerry got me this beautiful book for my birthday last year, offering me a chance not just to learn about Frida from a bird’s eye view but rather to experience her art, her soul, and her passion from her own personal perspective. I wasn’t disappointed. It’s not perfect (some of the analysis offered alongside Frida’s diary entires is a bit wonky), but it’s a stunning collection. Through sketches, letters, poems, and short anecdotes, it offers you a front seat ride into the heart and mind of one of the most memorable artists of all time. It’s not an autobiography or memoir in the traditional sense, not in the slightest. Instead, it’s like a graphic novel, one that allows you to glimpse the spectrum of beauty, pain, and passion this queer icon experienced in the last 10 years of her short but fascinating life, one largely dominated by debilitating health issues and her tumultuous romance with Rivera (as well as with other famous men and women). I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book, and I absolutely recommend it as a great place to start if you’re at all interested in learning more about the unforgettable Frida."

The Diary of Frida Kahlo: An Intimate Self-Portait, published in 2014, covers the years 1944-45 and masterfully intertwines the artistic dimension and the text entries. First of all, this is a diary. This is more than a book destined to people who loves reading. This is for people who loves arts, who loves Frida Kahlo, who wishes to understand the human mind and who wants perhaps to comprehend what triggers her art creation. Above all, this is an intimate and honest self-portrait. As you read her journal, you come to realize that Frida Kahlo had never predicted the publication of her words. Therefore, they are truly sincere. Some entries aren’t more than a few words or loose thoughts. Besides the text entries that unveil the dreams, fears and thoughts of the Mexican artist, this book includes seventy watercolor illustrations. Some of these sketches, self-portraits or paintings are brutal and painful. Reading Frida Kahlo’s journal and admiring the numerous illustrations was such an incredible spiritual experience. Suddenly, you have the urge to stop trying to analyze everything. As I said, some entries are resumed to a few words. The key is to feel and go with her thoughts, fears and dreams. Lastly, I must be honest and say this was the most beautiful book I have ever laid my hands on and I found myself contemplating it over and over again. Even the paper has the most amazing touch. I’d like to thank Abrams & Chronicle for sending me a copy. For more reviews, follow me on Instagram: @booksturnyouon"

The use of simple words, sometimes with no actual sentences, were powerful enough on their own. The subjects vary from very personal points of her life to very abstract ideas. She shows a lot of her affection for communism and, of course, for Diego Rivera, but I also had the pleasure of enjoying some Mexican culture within these amazing pages. Plus, there are paintful moments in the book in which she struggles with her operations, leg pain and so on. She basically lived a life in suffering, but she always found little joys in her limited ability to move and friends to share moments with. If the surrealist Frida would have been a writer I would deffinitely dig her books haha."

I am not very fluent in Spanish (but I do have a parent who is) so I was able to read some of her diary entries. Apart from the fact that I can’t read Spanish well, her art alone speaks for itself and was quite moving. I got chills from some of the art in her entries. When I look at the pages in the book, I feel like I am lost in Frida’s world and I love it. I really took my time admiring her art throughout this book and it felt very personal. She had such beautiful and intriguing ways of expressing herself. Her pain, her love. I could get lost looking through this book all day. The introduction is also beautifully written and is very in depth. Love this book and definitely recommend to anyone wishing to get a closer and more personal look into Frida’s life and art."

Frida's art and words never fail to move me. I didn't expect to open this book and see the actual pages of her illustrated diary (I expected a basic translation - before I got to that part I thought, oh no! Of course it's in Spanish!

Even worse, the three stars are because of the superb introductory essay by Carlos Fuentes which at least gave me a context for what I was going to read and view. Without that, I truly would have been completely lost. If you are an admirer of Kahlo’s work, I imagine her diary would further enhance your appreciation of her courage and honesty in the face of tremendous pain. The physical and emotional agony of Kahlo’s life comes through loud and clear. Kahlo’s diary was not intended for publication, but here it is. So is it fair to measure it against diaries meant for publication? Probably not but, not being a Kahlo fan, I have no other way to view it. It was other people’s words that made sense of the diary pages for me and, even then, the majority of pages were filled with “I love Diego” and free associated, stream of conscious lists and phrases. The diary is written in different colours of marker and the included images are doodles rather than developed pieces. Frankly, ‘dog’s breakfast’ is the term that comes to mind. But then I’m clearly not the audience for an artist whose work is surrealistic. I have no doubt I’d be well served being quite a bit looser in my own art, but until that happens, I’ll leave diaries like this one to more evolved reviewers."

Life goes by, and sets paths, which are not traveled in vain. But no one can stop ""freely"" to play by the wayside, because he will delay or upset the general atomic journey. From this comes discontent, from this comes despair and unhappiness. We all would like to be the sum total and not one of the numerical elements. Changes and struggles disconcert us, terrify us because they are constant and certain, we search for calm and ""peace"" because we foresee the death that we die every second. Opposites unite and nothing new or arrhythmic is discovered. We take refuge in, we take flight into irrationality, magic, abnormality, in fear of the extraordinary beauty of the truth of matter and dialectics, of whatever is healthy and strong, we like being sick to protect ourselves. Someone, something always protects us from the truth Our own ignorance and fear. Fear of everything, fear of knowing that we are no more than vectors direction construction and destruction to be alive, and to feel the anguish of waiting for the next moment and of taking part in the complex current not knowing that we are headed toward ourselves, through millions of stone beings , of bird beings, of star beings, of microbe beings, of fountain beings toward ourselves.”"

Extraordinary and very brutal, the journal covers the last ten years of her life in a variety of mediums. Some entries are straight forward -- or as ""straight forward"" as Kahlo the artist could be -- and some are very surreal word poems or colorful and evocative partial paintings and sketches. The image of Kahlo has become so commercialized (do an Amazon search and see what I mean) that the woman herself often seems lost in the money-grubbing chaos, the kind of image that people make stand in for whatever personal feelings they want revealed in connection with the artist. But reading the diary brings you back to the real Kahlo and, in particular, to her suffering which now seems inextricable from her art. Beautifully done book with a helpful chronology at the end."

I guess the idea was to reproduce the diary as it was and give you the feeling of seeing the original. Only problem is that unless you read Spanish you don't understand it anyway, so you have to go to the back and keep flipping back and forth between the translation and the commentary which interrupts the flow much more than it would to have a larger size page with the translation right there. And it's also not really a diary in the sense one usually thinks of a diary, it's more sketches and poems. As these reflect the last years of her life they are pretty poignant and sad--the cumulative effect was kind of depressing for me."

Time to decide the rating. First off I didn’t read the introduction, and am in no mood to read it anytime soon. I’ll instead read a biography. Back to the diary, I read it ebook, and what commentary are people taking about? What translations at the end of the book? There was the page in the original language and under it the translation. I found it extremely well done and comfortable to read, so no problem with the format for me. As for the content, I am gonna quote everything I deem important. This is how the diary start. I found it beautiful. There are countless « letters » to Diego that I can write but, to not make this review too long, I will put my favorite: It’s a lot. But it’s so beautiful. A lot of beautiful sketches got my eyes Three of her « quotes » (rather pages) I value most: I stop here with the quotes. « The origin of the two fridas » was such an enjoyable story and it is so beautiful, written in all simplicity. It gave me a great look at her character. The diary in itself told me a lot about her; « the first part » (which I have been quoting) told me about her love an beautiful sense of writing and view on life; « the second » told me about her political views, as well as what what caused them. I’m gonna quote only one thing from the second part, even tho others are important. This gives an insight on her beliefs I also learned that she loves drawing foots, rather draw them a lot. In symbolism to her accident, and handicap. « Feet what do I need them for If I have wings to fly. » Did she sucide? We still don’t know the cause of her death. She then says she’s better, and recall memories. She tells us what she witnessed at the Mexican revolution was the reason ehy she joined the communist party at 13 years old. But the diary ends with a thanking to several people And.. The diary made me go through a lot of emotions; her letters, sketches, memories, views, political thoughts, all were enjoyable. It left me raw, and made me learn a lot. So it deserves 5 stars. I don’t like rating diaries, but I can’t help myself but to rate it a 5. If I were to not rate it because it’s a persons life, than I won’t rate poetry or novels at all."

This diary gives more insight into her troubled life with a look at her sketches, letters and other writings as well as information on her health concerns and turbulent relationship with Diego Rivera. Honestly though I think the translation negatively impacted my enjoyment of the book. The diary itself has been duplicated faithfully here but the decision was made to put all the translation and notes in the back. Was the idea to just go through and let the images wash over you and then take the time to read the details in the back or to flip back and forth for each page? I think I would have preferred a different format, perhaps with the pages reproduced with large margins in which the translation would appear. I didn't like the idea of flipping back and forth so mostly settled for thumbing through the diary pages and then reading the back section with the translation and tiny black and white copies of the images. Didn't seem to do the artist justice that way."

Their dew is the sweat of an ever-new lover. It's not love, or tenderness, or affection, it's life itself, my life, that I found when I saw it in your hands, in your mouth and in your breasts. (page 216, part of a letter/poem to Diego) <1>If only, I had his caresses upon me As the air touches the earth -- the reality of his person, would make me merrier, it would take me away from the feeling which fills me with gray. Nothing inside me would be so deep, so final. But, how can I explain to him my need for tenderness! My loneliness over the years. My structure displeases because of its lack of harmony, its unfitness. I think it would be better for me to go, to go and not to . If it were all over with in an instant. I hope so (page 275)"

At times one feels as they shouldn't be reading this, after all, she never meant for it to be published. On the other side, the diary is cryptic and abstract enough to protect itself. And it is sometimes heartbreakingly sad. I do feel like I know a bit more about Frida Khalo by reading this, but this Frida is different from the Frida I knew through her paintings. The Auto-portrait Frida is strong and silent and this one speaks about her fears, her pain, her love. The sketches are dark and even though she uses colour from time to time, brown, red, orange and black predominate the palette of her diary. What was I expecting? Sketches of her famous work and stories related to those, but I didn't realise the diary was written in a time where she almost couldn't paint at all. Interesting? Very."

This book is an awesome concept and we should all feel privileged to get this kind of look into Frida Kahlo's innermost thoughts. Having access to her diary essentially gives us access to her mind. I only gave it four stars because I didn't love the format. The entire diary makes up most of the book in full color and, obviously, in original Spanish. This was awesome, but then the translation and interpretation portion of it was printed after the journal with black and white thumbnails of each page. It would probably have been better (for an English-only speaker like myself - wish I could read/speak Spanish!) if each full page of the journal was immediately followed by the translation and interpretation. I think that might've made for a better flow."

The diary is a guide to the inner workings of a truly complicated woman, one filled with pain, with love, with laughter, with darkness, with color. The art was very striking, granted I wasn't very fond of that very long intro but I think the drawings speak for themselves, this was my first real introduction into her work, besides the paintings I see in places, but overall I was impressed, because everything felt personal, truly. Obviously, it was her diary, but it really just struck me how she poured everything into her art, it is how she breathed--LIVED. Read it because it can provide insight into a complicated person."

A lot of the text in her diary revolves around Mexico, love, culture, Diego Rivera, insecurities, sexuality, and personal thoughts. Her words are so powerful, complex, and filled with meaning. You can really get to feel her soul reaching out at you through the pages. Take the time to examine each individual illustration and poem, you'll find something new everything you look at it. If you are interested in Frida Kahlo in the slightest bit I highly recommend reading her diary. I recommend looking at the diary passage itself then looking at the translation, to form clear thoughts on each entry. The content of each page ranges and has so many complexities."

It's also a shame that the translation is at the very end of the book, making reading it not the most practical thing but I loved it very very much nevermind. Not only for the stunning drawings, amazing poetry and touching letters in it, but because it helped me to understand Frida, the artist, the woman, the wife on a whole new level. Her writing made me tear up several times and something about the her diary really touched my soul. I knew how inspiring and strong Frida was, I never knew how sensitive and loving she had been too. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes her work and or is interested in her story. It is worth every pound."

Reading about the famous painter Frida Kahlo through her own words makes it all the more special. The translations I noticed were almost exactly what Kahlo was trying to say because I know that sometimes the meaning of words can be lost in translation, but not in this translation. Not only did they translate the words but they also broke down the meaning of her doodles in the book which allowed me to see the deeper meaning of her illustrations. Kahlo's emotions are shown through her words and it is amazing to read about her tragic life"

Diego. She who wears the color. He who sees the color. Since the year 1922. Until always and forever. No in 1944. After all the hours lived through. The vectors continue in their original direction. Nothing stops them. With no more knowledge than live emotion. With no other wish than to go on until they meet. Slowly. With great unease, but with the certainty that all is guided by the “golden section.” There is cellular arrangement. There is movement. There is light. All centers are the same. Folly doesn’t exist. We are the same as we were and as we will be. Not counting on idiotic destiny."

The diary itself, is beautiful and poetic: her words, accompanied by sketches, are powerful and moving. The essay by Sarah Lowe is interesting and added to my understanding of Khalo and the document. But the introduction by Carlos Fuentes was opaque and a difficult read. Also, the layout of the book, with the glossy colour reproduction of diary in the middle is accompanied by translations at the end which made for continuous flipping back and forth and multiple bookmarks. For Khalo enthusiasts, this is a must-read, but I found the layout of the book awkward and annoying."

So of course I was intrigued, and incredibly excited to say the least, when I stumbled upon this book. The book itself is a nice mixture between the essays and commentaries that are made in relation to the content of the diary, and the brilliant illustrations, poetry(Ish) texts, thoughts and memoirs created by Kahlo. It makes a beautiful creation, that I quite frankly do not ever want to stop reading."

We get a personal picture of Frida Kahlo’s life through her diary filled with beautiful art, sometimes self portraits, letters, and poems. At first, I was excited to read it, but realized I can’t read Spanish so I was glad there were translations, but some of the background information (which was entirely helpful) was perhaps too much to the point where it ruined it for me.

I don't know that she would support its publication were she alive. Parts of the commentary I didn't read because they were dry and provided more insight into her art than her life, which is why I mainly chose to read Frida's own text. The evolution of her drawings and paintings throughout the book were fascinating to take in. Not only was her illness deeply reflected in her work, but her coping and ultimately overcoming as well.

The drawings are of course fabulous and the book is very decorative and appealing. But the editing of the book!! Have the editors ever seen a published diary before?! They have inserted their comments BEFORE Frida's text, and not after as it is usually done. Explanations and comments are fine and well done, but they shouldn't be read before the actual text of the diary. By doing that, the editor has influenced the reader's impression of the text. Poor Frida! Has she really deserved that?"

This is not a typical diary. I expected no less because Frida wasn't a typical person. Through this diary we can feel how fierce she was but also how much she loved and how much she suffered due to her ilness and due to Diego's infedelities. I think this tells the last monthes of Frida's life very well, taking us on a journey through her mind. There are some entries that don't make much sense but overall I feel like this is a diary that all fans of Frida should read."

It was well worth it, though. I think that people who are looking for a day by day description of activities might be disappointed, but I would also hope that they would not expect something like that from Kahlo. This is her actual diary which describes how she feels about Diego, politics, her medical condition, and life in general. I think the best part is that it comes with rare paintings and drawings. I'd give it a shot."

She starts this diary at 37 (my current age) and it takes you through the last 10 years of her life. Not your typical narrative diary, and she never meant for it to be published. It is full of images, poems, thoughts. She is preoccupied with death and Diego. The diary shows how she relied on art to express the emotional and physical traumas throughout a life marked by 30-something surgeries and near-constant pain. Includes her likely last painting. A strange angel trailed with blood in pink skies."

I felt like I got a much better understanding of Frida, particularly in the last years of her life. This was really intimate and I often found myself getting lost in her writing (because of its extreme honesty and vulnerability) My one complaint is the format of this book, would have loved to have had the images with the descriptions to be in color to not have to flip back and forth, but that was a minor issue. I couldn't help but wonder what Frida would have thought of everyone reading her diary?"

The problem is that it was a bit too personal for me to fully enjoy. The book itself was quick to get through due to the fact that most of it was copied illustrations from her diary. I did enjoy Carlo's Fuentes introduction. He made many references to other artists, and writers. The book as a whole could have been better."

It has some powerful poetry, love letters to Diego, disturbing drawings and much about Frida's physical pain and doctors and other various interests such as chocolate and history. Each page has a corresponding page in the back with full translation as well as history/explanation for each.

At times I disagreed with the commentary and insight of her work. images that were marked horrifying I found beautiful. And who are we to speculate on someone’s private moments up until their death? A removal of several diary pages reminds us of this. You also see, through her subject matter, script/penmanship and frequency, her decline in her diary."

He asserted that color ""is almost never seen as it really is"" and that ""color deceives continually"", and he suggested that color is best studied via experience, underpinned by experimentation and observation. A handbook and teaching aid for artists, instructors, and students, this timeless book presents Albers’s unique ideas of color experimentation in a way that is valuable to specialists as well as to a larger audience. تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز پنجم ماه آگوست سال 2010میلادی عنوان: ت‍اث‍ی‍ر م‍ت‍ق‍اب‍ل‌ رن‍گ‍ه‍ا: م‍ت‍ن‌ چ‍اپ‌ اص‍ل‍ی‌ ب‍ا چ‍ن‍د ل‍وح‌ ان‍ت‍خ‍اب‍ی‌؛ ج‍وزف‌ آل‍ب‍رز (آلبرس)؛ مت‍رج‍م ع‍رب‍ع‍ل‍ی‌ ش‍روه‌؛ تهران، نشر نی، 1368، در 113ص و 8ص؛ مصور، نمودار، عنوان روی جلد: ت‍اث‍ی‍ر م‍ت‍ق‍اب‍ل‌ رن‍گ‍ه‍ا: م‍طال‍ع‍ات‌ ت‍ج‍رب‍ی‌ در زم‍ی‍ن‍ه‌ ش‍ن‍اخ‍ت‌ رن‍گ‌ و ک‍ارب‍رد آن‌ در ن‍ق‍اش‍ی‌، گ‍راف‍ی‍ک‌ و چ‍اپ‌؛ چاپ دوم سال 1371؛ چاپ سوم سال 1388؛ در 192ص؛ شابک 9789641851080؛ موضوع نوشتارهای نویسندگان آلمانی تبار ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20م فهرست: «پیش گفتار مترجم»؛ «مقدمه»، «پیش گفتار»؛ «به خاطر آوری رنگ - حافظه بصری»؛ «خواندن رنگ و همبافت»؛ «چرا به جای ماده رنگی کاغذ رنگی؟»؛ «رنگ چهره های گوناگون دارد - نسبیت رنگ»؛ «تیره تر یا روشنتر - شدت روشنی»، «مطالعات درجه بندیها - ارائه هایی جدید»؛ «شدت رنگ - درخشندگی»؛ «یک رنگ با دو چهره - شباهت داشتن به زمینه معکوس»؛ «همانند به نظر رسیدن دو رنگ مختلف، تفریق رنگ»؛ «چرا خطای رنگ؟ - پس انگاره کنتراست همزمانی»؛ «آمیختن رنگ با کاغذ رنگی - شفافیت مجازی»؛ «آمیخته های حقیقی - افزایشی و کاهشی»؛ «شفافیت و فضای مجازی - مرزهای رنگ و عمل حجم پذیری»؛ «آمیخته ی بصری - بررسی دوباره پس انگاره»؛ «پدیده بتسولد؛ فواصل رنگی و انتقال آنها»؛ «بار دیگر آمیخته میانی - تقاطع رنگها»؛ «کنار هم قرار گرفتن رنگها - هماهنگی و کمیت»؛ «فیلم رنگ و حجم رنگ - دو نمود طبیعی»؛ «مطالعات آزاد - نوارهای کاغذی در کنار هم قرار دادن آنها به صورتی محدود»؛ «استادان - سازبندی»؛ «قانون وبر - فچنر - اندازه ترکیب»؛ «از گرمای رنگ تا رطوبت آن»؛ «مرزهای لرزان - لبه های تقویت شده»؛ «شدت روشنایی برابر - مرزهای محو»؛ «نظریه های رنگی - دستگاههای رنگ»؛ «درباره آموزش رنگ - چند اصطلاح مربوط به رنگ»؛ «واریانت در مقابل واریته»؛ «به جای کتابنامه»؛ «لوح ها و تفسیرها»؛ «شفافیت و فضای مجازی»؛ «آمیخته بصری بتسولد»؛ «فواصل رنگی و انتقال آنها»؛ «تاثیر متقابل یا تقاطع»؛ «کمیت»؛ «سطح رنگ»؛ «مطالعات آزاد»؛ «قانون وبر فچنر»؛ «»؛ سرد و گرم»؛ «مرزهای رنگی»؛ «روشنی برابری»؛ «نظریه های رنگ»؛ «مطالعه برگ»؛ «واژه نامه»؛ در دریافت بصری معمولا یک رنگ آنطور که از نظر فیزیکی هست دیده نمیشود؛ همین حقیقت سبب میشود که رنگ نسبیترین عنصر در نقاشی باشد؛ برای اینکه رنگ را به صورتی موثر مورد استفاده قرار دهیم، لازم است بدانیم که رنگ همواره فریب میدهد؛ در وهلة اول بایست پی ببریم که چگونه یک رنگ واحد میتواند ظواهر و نمودهای بیشماری به خود بگیرد؛ به جای اینکه قوانین هماهنگی رنگ را به صورت مکانیکی به کار ببندیم، بایستی ظواهر و نمودهای مشخص رنگ را از راه شناخت تاثیر متقابل آنها به وجود آوریم؛ نگارنده در این کتاب روش تجربی را در مطالعه ی رنگ و آموزش آن بیان میدارند و مطالبی از این دست ارائه مینمایند: (خواندن رنگ و همبافت؛ رنگ چهره های گوناگونی دارد نسبیت رنگ؛ شدت رنگ درخشندگی؛ شفافیت و فضای مجازی؛ مرزهای رنگ و عمل حجم پذیری؛ عوامل رنگی و انتقال آنها؛ نظریه های رنگی دستگاه های رنگ و لوحها و تفسیر آنها.)؛ تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 14/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

But overall, it's hard to say that I really got anything from Interaction of Color. There isn't much concrete information that you feel like you're learning and could use. A lot of it is composed of specific examples, but not a helpful base of ideas that one can use to jump into thought and practice with. Also, it's very text heavy, which is weird for a book about color. There are examples in the back with accompanying paragraphs, which I honestly found more helpful than the main text, which can feel cluttered and boring. Many examples want you to go out and use color paper. I'd much rather have the book give me the examples itself. Recommend if you're intrigued."

Reading Rebecca Solnit's essay about Ives Klein’s blue in A Field Guide to Getting Lost made my hungry for even more colour and it reminded me that this book was waiting for me to read. I was lucky. Josef Albers explains that colours are just like sounds: They make sense only when you combine them. Albers explains how it works and it’s stunning: The combination can makes colours look very different. Moreover, we combine colours not only on paper or canvas; we combine just as well in our heads, consciously or unconsciously! He says: Josef Albers wrote this book as a concise colour course, but it reads as a fascinating essay just as well. Albers claims and I agree: Albers suggests using coloured sheets of paper, cut in various forms and laid in various combinations, to illustrate his theory and encourage students to discover by themselves colour dynamics. The dazzling illustrations make this book enjoyable even without having to cut coloured sheets of paper. You can even skip the theory part and just enjoy the illustrations. You’ll be amazed! Cyndi Lauper once sang: ‘I see your true colours’. I thought about this song while reading this book. Now I realize seeing true colours is almost impossible.

Even today, the book's look at color is still engaging and radical. There is no color wheel, the terms warm and cool are not assigned to specific colors, and the juxtaposition of colors next to each other can be deceiving to the eyes. Although it would probably have a larger impact with a lecture (which can be found online) than essentially reading instructions for a teacher, it is still worthwhile. Some chapters go away from the technical instructions to rather poetic and passionate observations of color in the world around us. Looking at the plates with commentary sets forth the ideas Albers demonstrates and explains throughout like seeing after image effects to colors and shapes revealing their interactions with each other."

Two big problems inside the mind, neither of which I really understand. 'Binding' which I think is working out what objects are which, and 'Combination' which is about creating the matrix-like world-view which our little homunculus sits inside while riding the body around. All of this started because I like Louise Sugdens painting style and because I like Dazzle Patterns on ships, and so I began a small investigation into colour, in particular, into colour and mass/shape... After all, it’s only trying to understand how colour works, and how that combines with our sensation and understanding of mass.. how hard can it be? Answer - INFINITELY HARD, for the very question opens the doorway to a crystalline dungeon of PRISMATIC MYSTERIES. The search has taken me through Neurobiology (We Know It When We See It by Richard Masland), Ship Camouflage in WWI (Dazzle - disguise and disruption in war and art by James Taylor), and a deep cut into colour as used by artists (Interaction of Colour by Josef Albers). We can also possibly add 'Through the Language Glass' by Guy Deushter, about a mild Sapier-Whorff effect in language and colour. IS COLOUR THE MOST RELATIVE SENSE? or just the most obviously relative? So many scientists, art teachers, philosophers, messing around with coloured thread, coloured sheets of paper, swatches of colour, showing them to people of different nations, in classrooms, in laboratories, to rabbits while a hole has been drilled in their skulls to let the electrodes in, sailing around looking for rare islanders so you can show them the colours and write down what they say. More flags, shining lights, patterns of shade and texture. Albers would remind us that our understanding of all these colours is massively shaped by context, types of light, (electric, dawn, dusk, passing clouds, albedo), by the arrangement of colours around and within each other, one colour on another, next to another, torn edges, straight edges, curly shapes, blocky shapes, texture on flat and so on and so on, so that he might regard these neurologists and cultural analysts running around as quite mad and pointless. ALBERS - The most curious and unique of the minds I have witnessed through text. A man with the very tight, intense, highly disciplined brain of a laboratory scientist, a careful, systematic and procedural method to his teaching (learning about colour is *not about self-expression!*). And yet, with the least scientific aim and probably the greatest scepticism towards the systemising, totalising goal of science. Albers is learning and teaching his students, through the medium of relentless attention and careful systematic analysis, about something he believes is very, very, highly relative. Fluid within perception and within the mind, to the extent that considering colour outside of its context, as an isolated quality, I think to him that would be utterly insane, since that is something it can never be. Is it really the most relative of sensations? I think probably it is not, but that it is the most *observably relative* because it comes to us always alongside shape, objects and *DIVIDING LINES*, and I think the secret to the perceived relativity of colour is not that it is more relative than touch, smell or sound, but that it is more relative than objects and lines. The mind is Binding and Combining the shapes of objects and dividing lines between things (""edge detection"") all the time, and however it is doing this (we still don't really know), it seems to me that shapes, objects and lines are a lot less relative and debateable (both within the mind and beyond it) than the colours which always are sensed with and alongside them. We might not all be seeing the same colours, and we can be certain, that in different lights and different times of day, things which register as always having the same colour in our minds, in fact have quite different colours, and that our brain is clearly fudging the issue, but *in comparison* to colour, we can be much more certain that the lines, shapes and objects we perceive, are both coherent to themselves and coherent when discussed and compared between individuals. ""That big rock, is it more yellow or green would you say?"" and never ""That big yellow-green thing, rock or sponge, would you say?"" And it is this, the evidently-relative-relativity, if you will excuse an awful phrase, which makes colour more obviously relative than sound or touch, because it lives along side and is always contrasted with, shape and line, which is very much less relative (probably more dominant, earlier maybe, in the binding & combining process). IS THE BLUE I SEE THE SAME AS YOURS It’s likely. If it’s not exactly the same it’s probably pretty similar, unless you are at the far end of the curve, and most crucially, as Albers would tell you, IT DOESN'T MATTER! For colour is REALIVE and exists only relative to its context and therefore all that truly matters is if what you see as blue has the same relative relation to what you see as red green etc as everyone else which it probably does (though maybe not entirely). COLOUR AND TIME, VISION AND TIME While I know nothing about any of this I know even less about this part so beware, but it seems to me that vision and in particular the binding and combining of colour and form, and many colours, gives us access to a kind of island of no-time within our own minds. As Albers would tell us, and here I'll bring in Ian McGilchrist of ""The Master and His Emissary"", sound is sequential, it can only happen in a row of information (though different sounds can be combined at the same time), touch is a bit less sequential, you can tough something with different bits of yourself, or be touched at once. Movement has a 'moment of movement' but is quite largely sequential, it happens in a row but vision, and the sensing of colour and shape, am I wrong in thinking that it has the least sequential elements? McGilchrist would say that one part of the mind senses and 'sees' everything in one big burst and the other scans and sequentialises, so maybe sight, vision, has the most complex experience of time within the mind. When I imagine the binding/combining process, I imagine something with a 'loose moment', a kind of drifting, or indistinct sense of the 'now'. The mind sees, absorbs, identifies, arranges and understands, all happening together. The big blurt of information from the all-at-once scan, the rapid sequential object scanning, the binding and combining shape colour, shade, light, fluid integration and re-integration with the imagined and re-constructed mind-state, both what 'just happened' (the part that makes us think the rabbit is still inside the hat) and the 'about to happen' (that lets tennis stars work out where the ball is *going to be*, all of this, binding and combining, looping and feeding back, continually, whenever our eyes are open. And so, within the mechanisms of vision are many mutual but simultaneous *perceptions of time*. sequential, global, memory looking back and imagination/modelling looking forward, all happening ""at once"". The experience of vision is like a kind of time machine, a timeless, or looped moment within ourselves, which we can dip into and experience, slightly, a more or less time-powered moment, variations on what 'now' is. WHY DO I GET A GIDDY FEELING WHEN PRESSING AGAINST THE EDGES OF THE IDEA? Perhaps this presentiment of the complex nature of consciousness, vision, time, self awareness, is why when I reach certain points of Albers book, Maslands book and McGilchrists, I get a kind of giddy feeling. That feeling when you are just on the borders of a great idea, the moment before something complex, difficult and indistinct synthesises inside your mind into a coherent whole. This might just be the borders of my own stupidity. Or am I pressing against the edge of REALITY ITSELF???? AM I SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THIS STUFF? Probably not really no. Masland is pop-sci and at the deeper end I struggle. Albers, god damn fucking Germanic Albers. First its a book of experiments really, that you are meant to perform, and I didn't. Didn't have the right stuff, time or will. And second he writes in this bloody art-school Germanic hyper-clear style, which because it is hyper clear and has only the correct info in it is fucking hard to get through. There is no pulse of info/blather for you brain to take a moment to recombine, instead its infoinfoinfoinfo. Its one of the most interesting books on colour that I have ever read, but again, I found it a struggle, especially towards the end. There were effects and ideas that I found it hard to perceive, model and consider, and so I ended up somewhat, sweeping over the words in a fearful rush. Back in secondary school maths again! fuck! COLOUR AND MASS, SHADE, SHINE, BRIGHTNESS AGGGHHHHHHH! God fucking damn it brain, why you have to be so complex. All I wanted to understand was colour and mass. Well, good news. Brain works out what shape and mass things are about 20 different ways at once. Edge detection and memory probably the most simple, though they exist at different ends of the binding/combining process (probably, we don't really know, and as I theorised above, 'different ends' likely doesn't make much sense in a temporarily fluid process with massive feedback loops). Other ways - shade, light, texture, gleam, RELATIVE COLOUR. whoop de fucking do, all these things are changing massively, continually, always, depending on light, weather, perceptions, environment, background, movement between objects , movement WITHIN an object (which way will the Zebra jump - dunno as bunching muscles all fucked up by those dang stripes), and everything else. False weathering patterns on 40k minis, showing you illusory mass one way, comic book style highlights on minis showing you mass another way, fake metal gleams in the non-metallic metal process showing you shape of imaginary metal, Blanchitsu style with decay and deep shadows, and the pale and nacreous skin which is good at showing those gothic shadows, showing you mass another way. All somehow dealing with mass, or the delusion of mass, enhancing and re-creating the sense of 'shape' using false or simulated miniaturisations of aspects of the real(er) large scale world. AND ALL DIFFERENT!!! Especially when considered as different painting techniques, as in you literally need to do and think about a lot of stuff differently to employ each one. Camouflage probably provides the key to entry to this subject but I have only read one book on it - stuff on 'Dazzle' (which seems like it didn't actually work, looked fucking cool though - raised morale, that counts! But there are even different techniques and ideas behind kinds of camouflage. Camo for invisibility for disruption of shape, of movement, counter-shading seems to have been invented, or re-invented by camo people (and oddly enough that is the exact opposite of a mini technique called zenithal highlighting). Looking into the way camo destroys the understanding of mass and shape as a method for understanding how the eye and mind create and perceive mass and shape seems like a good idea. More on this later perhaps. SIMULATION THEORY IS FUCKING DISGUSTING Gotta do a brief postscript in Patricks Schizophrenia Hour. As a result of looking into this I now hate Simulation Theory even more than I did before, whic was a lot. It’s the ultimate narcissistic , ressentiment-based conspiracy theory, except instead of being focused on governments and social systems its focused on ALL OF REALITY It’s also clearly theology, and bad theology at that. Investigation of the detail and subtlety of the human sensing, binding and combining process and its integration into consciousness, means that believing in simulation theory means that whatever is running the simulation both carefully and exactingly created the illusion of a hyper-complex system which evolved over bazillions of years to sense and inhabit a very particular complex eco-system AND left clues behind for the enlightened to see that thhis was all made up. Just like the God of Abraham leaving dinosaur bones behind as a test of faith. It is a vile doctrine of superiority, the product of alienation, narcissism and a high IQ."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},a book I picked up at random in Switzerland became my go-to reference to color and probably the most thorough source of explanation regarding how color exist thanks to and through the next one.
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have very mixed feelings about this classic. What I like about it: This book focuses on interactions of color, based on the idea/fact that a color is rarely seen alone but always in relation to other colors—""Color is the most relative medium of art."" This perspective is in a way in contrast to the prevailing color theory which presents color first and forecast as a combination of their three attributes (hue, value, saturation), therefore a constant, physical existence. The way that this book teaches us to see—or rather, to perceive—colors is invaluable. The book provides numerous strikingly self-explanatory examples on various visual effects and illusions to demonstrate the relativity of colors (assuring its readers that it's not our fault if we are so often misled and deceived by colors). Although the physical version only contains a selective set of such examples, many more can be found online. This book is not suitable for self-study, especially for people who don't have a basic (but comprehensive) understanding of color theory. Most exercises and practices in the book are given in the form of group assignments and discussions and indeed only work well in that way. Moreover, the writing of the book can be sometimes opaque, too concise and coded, as if it is written as instructions for the teachers, not the students. This book, written almost 60 years ago, does not touch on how colors are viewed, used and manipulated in this digital age. An absence that will only grow more pronounced as ""colored papers"", the principal material used in the book for practice, become more and more scarce. The format of the book is also questionable. Exemplary images are placed together as a separate section from the texts. Therefore one needs to constantly go back and forth between texts and their corresponding examples. (The examples are meant to be shown as individual plates during lectures.) Moreover, throughout the book numbers are presented in numerals instead of words, which seems to be totally unreasonable, even annoying."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This title is really a set of lesson plans for art teachers. Utilizing an expansive set of student-collected color strips cut from magazines (or a catalog of colored transparencies or even autumn leaves, pressed and laminated), it offers some loose guidelines for teachers to Socratically elicit from the students a growing appreciation of the mutability and subjectiveness of that ""most relative of mediums - color."" If you are interested in learning about the interaction of color in a non-classroom situation, then I recommend looking beyond this title. Albers does though provide some clues to seek classical thinking on this subject. Throughout the brief book, Albers offers several guided exercises to help students analyse the properties of color, but leaves academic discovery to the individual participant. Over fifty years old, the march of technology has rendered transparencies obsolete, but his exercises could still be instructive. Albers' method, again relying on the nurturing collective of the classroom to seed and help grow an awareness of color's wily and transformative ability, would be an enormously revealing procedure if mentored by an experienced and knowledgable master. But in lieu of access to such resources, this reader is forced again to haunt bookshelves in search of some color theory education."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book would be a great way of introducing students to philosophical questions about color. It's written as a kind of experiment-based lesson plan for an art class on color, but the reader gets the benefit of a bunch of beautiful color plates illustrating Albers's experiments. Albers shows how to make two pieces of the same color paper look like two different colors when placed against different backgrounds, how to make three colors look like two, how to make two different colors look identical, and how to make a single gray look almost unrecognizable against different backgrounds. These experiments demonstrate spectacularly and undeniably the idea that the way things look is ""active"" and ""relative""--that the color things appear to have depends enormously on their surroundings. Albers doesn't raise the inevitable question whether there is any such thing as the ""real"" color of an object, but it is implicit throughout this study, and the answer to it has to be J.L. Austin's answer, that the ""real"" color of a thing is itself relative to a variety of different factors."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Josef Albers is a brilliant teacher, he provides enough instruction for a student reading the book to explore, but not too much as to prevent them from thinking flexibly about color. His pedagogy for color is also applicable for other aspects of Design. After reading the book, it feels like my eyes have opened up to a whole new world. He draws your attention to the subtle ways that color interact with each other. I really enjoyed his writing style. He writes poetically and beautifully about color, and inspires a passion for color as much as he provides knowledge about it. He uses many analogies to not only help the reader understand color but also understand how one can think about color. On a last note, I would look into getting the iPad app for the book. As much as I enjoyed reading the book and attempted to create and go through the exercises it's probably better done in the app. I would also recommend going through this book with people who are trained in color or with a friend so you can compare your work with one another."

Top notch type choices in this edition. 👏 It’s essentially a textbook for professors on how to teach their students color theory. It is fascinating how Albers set up the structure that is still used in art education today (I almost forgot about my Foundations of Art class 😣) but I didn’t exactly learn anything new. Kind of what I already understood about color, explained in the most clunky way I could imagine. Sorry…. So much less of this content was common knowledge at the time than it is now so I understand that but still made it really mind numbing. Yes, I do see that color is lighter, can we move on? On the other hand he made some simple ideas really go over my head. I would like to read some of his other works because the parts where he gets into more abstract ideas about color relationships were really interesting."

I love colour and the exploration of it, and was hoping to understand colours more at a psychological level. This book, rather than explaining meanings, explains how to view colours around us and understand the interactions between them. While I think the information in here is incredible and sometimes eye-opening to the way I view colour, I cannot help but sometimes get lulled into a daze by the antiquated speech and the scholarly tone. I understand this was written for teachers to help their students learn better, but as a self-guided learner I found this book often dull and hard to focus on, much like reading a textbook."

It gave me an appreciation abstract art, which had never resonated for me prior to my participatory immersion in the challenges Albers creates. It also gave me a much deeper understanding of the ways people experience color. This book is a game changer for any artist who physically does all the exercises and has the benefit of seeing and hearing other students' reactions. NOTE: I was 18 when I took this class.

I know i would find some parts very suprising if i was not very familiar with how color works. Unfortunately i was also doing a lot of research on color interactions lately so this book didn't expand my horizon in this context but it was still nice to see many examples of colors with each other. I like the reminder of how just picking harmonious colors is not enough and it is barely the beginning when it comes to creating something pleasing.

Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Interaction of Color is comprised of two halves. The first half of the book contains the main text and is printed in black and white. The second half consists of color “plates” which showcase specific examples from the main text, along with some supplementary text of its own. This format requires keeping two bookmarks—one for your position in the reading, and one for the corresponding illustrations some 100 pages later. For a book devoted to the study of color, this is baffling and mildly infuriating. I suspect this format is held over from the book’s original 1963 edition, when printing a full color book may have been prohibitively expensive. To blindly adopt this design over 50 years later is an unfortunate oversight. Albers’s writing seems directed more toward teachers like Josef Albers and less toward people like Josef Albers’s students. It instructs readers why colored paper is best for classroom projects (mixing paints and textures is distracting), why to restrict a certain project to vertical strips of color only (shapes are distracting), and which brands of acetate sheets to buy (“Zip-a-tone,” “Artype,” and “Cello-tak”). Like a true academic, Albers’s tone is pretentious and dry. Oddly, he seems to love inserting line breaks at arbitrary points. He may fancy a work of poetry, but I’d really rather read text with a predictable line-length. Form and format aside, the content is quite good. At its original publishing, Albers’s work was revolutionary, and it still holds its own in 2017. presents novel ways of interpreting and applying color, it’s opened my mind to colors and color combinations I may have dismissed previously. If you’re a designer, is a book worth adding to your collection. Regrettably, nowhere in the 50th anniversary is there a mention of how to apply these techniques to screen design for digital designers like myself. I would love to see an updated edition—or perhaps a new book entirely from one of Albers’s students—which corrects the issues listed above, goes beyond staged classroom examples to point out meaningful uses of color in the real world, delves into the differences between print and screen, and overall makes the book more practical and approachable without losing Albers’s pioneering spirit."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"So first, the back story – in Mexico City, we visited the incredibly beautiful Casa Gilardi, designed by Luis Barragán. Our guide Eduardo, who grew up in the house, cited Josef Albers, and this book in particular, as sources of inspiration for Barragán’s use of color – sure enough, there are plenty of instances in the house where Barragán was clearly thinking about simultaneous contrast, film vs. surface colors, and other color effects Albers describes. I think “helped inspire the colors of Casa Gilardi” is a pretty compelling recommendation for a book, so I was sold immediately. Having recently read Johannes Itten’s Elements of Color, Albers (a student of Itten’s) provided a welcome contrast. Itten tried to develop a universal, objective system of color, which wound up feeling like an attempt to codify (and thus ossify) his subjective experience. Albers is much more willing to acknowledge that people have different responses to and preferences for colors, and his book is consequently more narrowly circumscribed. He’s not attempting to lay out a universal theory on color; he describes how color is ultimately subjective and relative, where the color’s perception depends on its surroundings, lighting, process/medium, and viewer. Albers doesn’t dictate which colors should be used and how, but instead encourages readers to explore what works for themselves. Ultimately, you probably need a bit of both Itten and Albers – an understanding of the character of each color individually and the ways that they influence one another – but Albers’s lessons offer the chance to develop a more mature and personal understanding of color, in my view. I think this is a book I’ll want to revisit. The exercises seem like good practice for gaining a deeper, more hands-on understanding of color interaction. One of my few complaints is that the printing in this paperback seems not to be perfect – the red on the pages differs from the red on the cover, and some exercises with red tones seem not to work well as a result – so maybe I’ll try to get my hands on the more expensive full-format version next time (or even the iPad app, although first I’d need an iPad). After all, if this worked for Barragán, I think it’s probably wise to keep it handy in the toolkit."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On the surface this book is a refreshing and comprehensive treatise on color theory, one that emphasizes the merits of using discovery and practice before theory and research. But on a deeper level, this book is much more than that–it's a concise and extremely effective shortcut to learning creative thinking, what Albers calls ""thinking in situations."" I say this both as a designer who was educated using Albers' methods, and as a teacher who's used his methods in the lab and workshop environments he advocated for. Overall, this book reveals just how bright of a mind Josef Albers was, not only as a designer and an artist, but as a gestalt thinker. I especially liked his incisive inclusion of the psychological and physical aspects of color theory as they related to human perception. It's that big picture perspective that's endeared me to Albers–not that I wasn't already a fan."
Interaction of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111113.Interaction_of_Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In visual perception a color is almost never seen as it - physically- is. This fact makes color the most relative medium in art. It should be learned that instead of mechanically applying or merely implying laws and rules, color effects are produced through recognition of the interaction of color. The aim of such study is to develop an eye for color. This book, therefore, does not follow an academic conception of “theory and practice.” It reverses this order and places practice before theory. Each exercise is explained and illustrated - not to give a specific answer, but to suggest a way of study. ^_^ “Josef Albers was a member of the Bauhaus in Germany during the 1920s, joined the faculty at Yale University as chairman of the Department of Design and was named emeritus professor of art.”"

I don’t know who the hell put together this copy, but its inconsistent alignment, margins, and just overall organisation of the actual contents made me want to set fire to my copy, before taking out my own eyes and giving them a good wash. Horrid! Secondly, I wish I had known before buying this, that it’s basically a course overview, a guideline for teachers looking at teaching colour comprehension. This is definitely not what I wanted, i.e. a book on colour theories. It still had some interesting exercises and information, but absolutely nothing in depth or fully explanatory, more like: this is a thing, you will need to find another book to fully explore the subject.

My samples are not as pristine as Albers versions, but he did get his students to do them for him. As a painter I found a lot of the studies centered on theories I use in my work intuitively but I would not have been able to put into words until now. It has given me a better understanding of colour and how it is used. I highly recommend artists/colourists to read and try doing at least some of the studies which will definitely benefit them in their work. I would not say this is the be all and end all of colour especially in painting since the studies do not allow for chance. Getting a dab of colour unintentionally on a brush can bring a painting to another level and in-turn a higher level of creativity."

Different with The Art of Colors by Itten which filled with a lot of theories, this book suggests that practice should precedes the understanding of colors, not through theory. The only limitation to really do the practices of this book, is where the hell can i find very broad range of colored papers in Jakarta? Might be very useful to teach the students with that. Overall highly recommended! But I suggest that anyone reading Johannes Itten first (which is more fundamental), and then this book later.

He teaches his students in a very practical way, using coloured paper, and includes similar examples in his book as well. While I understand that this book is one of the fundamentals in colour theory, it took me a long time to read it. Maybe the writing style is long outdated and makes it hard for the modern reader to grasp the subject. A lot of the examples also weren't that obvious to understand. However a lot of the facts are very interesting and must-knows for artists seeking to better understand colour and use it better.

Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I finished reading it for my comics/YA Graphic novels class this summer, 6/16/16 and now again, 8/8/17. I'll read this and use it to help people understand comics every year. It's the primary source though there are many good books coming out. What I have to add is that I had a fun conversation with my class about one insightful claim McCloud makes, that the simpler and more ""cartoony"" a comic representation is (i.e., a smiley face), the more universal it will be, the more we will say ""that's me."" In fiction classes I was taught to be as specific and detailed as I could be about characters and places. McCloud says that realistic depictions of characters such as in superhero comics are actually less relatable than simple characters such as Charlie Brown or Nancy, or most manga. Less is more, in a way. That's like suggesting that minimalism (something like Raymond Carver's stories, or Ernest Hemingway's stories) invite readers in more because we as readers have more space to ""be"" the characters, to connect with them. Maybe this is less true for non-comics fiction, though. But McCloud is interesting. Review from before: I've used this book many times to teach comics basics. It's the best book I've found for doing this, and it's in a comics format, with McCloud as the cartoony and erudite ""narrator"". While thoroughly practical, it's also the most philosophical and thorough and at the same time efficient guide to the craft. McCloud also wrote Making Comics, for comics artists. This book is one of the classics of comic history, one of its great books for helping you understand and appreciate comics for their potential complexity as an hybrid art form, without question. If you want to know how comics are made in all its range of possibilities, and if you want to take see why this interrelated telling of visuals and words should be taken seriously as art and literature and cultural commentary and entertainment, this is the book for you."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In the 1940s, groups of youths were sent house to house gathering comic books that had been deemed offensive and took part in a massive book burning of over 2000 books. This was not Nazi Germany, however, this was 1948 in the United States and part of the rather subversive history of US comics which is…well, considering the spirit of underground resistance against the , being looked down upon as the social rejects of reading, the embracing of “vulgarity” as political resistance, frequently banned yet always fighting back, using comics to make space for queer and other marginalized voices, the proliferation of zines at hardcore shows and the artsy corners of town, and more, the history of US comics is punk as fuck. I recently put on a history of comics at the library, bringing in the wonderful comic artist and graphic memoirist (author of ) to speak on this history and examine what comics are. During the presentation she recommended this book, by Scott McCloud, which is an incredible and rather accessible look at comics from academic theories on the form’s unique use of visual art and storytelling, visual literacy and the concept of icons, but also by presenting the subject matter in the very medium it is examining to further emphasize the points. There is a lot to consider here, from neuroscience of pattern recognition, the ways different cultures attach different values to iconography and why, to how the genre can be expanded and reach us in ways other visual arts cannot. A fantastic book and one I will now also be recommending to everyone I see. And to you. I can’t see you, but I’m telling you anyways. Yes you, reading this on your screen. Okay lets dive in. The word comics can be a bit confusing, because while yes it can be funny, thats not the point. It has also been used, along with “cartoon” as a rather diminutive term when it comes to art, which is fascinating because around the world the idea of comics and graphic novels (a bit on how that came to be as a way to bypass the Comics Code Authority in a moment) developed as a rather well respected art. While visual storytelling goes back to the time of cave painting, the modern idea of comics began around the early 1900s as experiments in the novel form: ‘,’ such as Belgian artist ’s twenty-one woodcut novels. The superhero genre of comics exploded in popularity in the US just as WWII began in Europe, however the Nazis shut off access to American culture in occupied countries, including comics. While there are some fascinating stories about visual arts even under the tightly censored reading material during their regime, that’s all for another upcoming review but the key here is US comics leaned heavily into superhero’s while Europe developed differently. There is also the long, beautiful history of Japanese art (manga is a form of art similar to comics but also vastly different with its own specific cultural heritage and aspects) and it is fascinating to think about how the varying cultural developments of visual storytelling is so integral to the form and styles. So what are comics, then, if we need a definition. McCloud, who prefers the term comics for the scope of the book says they are ‘’ Basically it is a series of visual frames (sometimes with words) that tells a story or creates emotion. This is like film except, as McCloud points out What has aided comics are two centuries of visual media developed from sequential images starting with French inventor taking the first photograph in 1822. As McCloud tells us ‘’ and we are able to accept a busy panel as being a still frame that still conveys an implied motion. Without being able to see movement the same way as, say, a film, artists have found ways to manipulate time by how they frame sequential panels. Artists have even broken the standard basic square panel in interesting ways to imply duration with visual clues, such as how “bleeds”—when a panel runs off the edge of the page or presses into the next—often ‘’ because of their ‘’ '' - Language can also be employed to orchestrate how the reader perceives motion, such as how a single sound (like the text “SNAP” to imply the shutter-snap of a camera) can grant a depth of duration or add a soundtrack. What I love about comics are the ways words often combine with art beyond simply being paired up in order to narrate the images. And I was thrilled to learn there are academic terms: --In , words and images follow different courses but don’t intersect—sort of like hearing a monologue or or a conversation happening offscreen while watching a different “narrative” play out wordlessly (imagine a that whole you read the previous sentence is was paired with four panels of showing a cat getting into mischief around a city or something). --A where the word is part of the art (a look of surprise shown by the word “WOW” written in place of wide eyes). --An is where words and pictures ‘’ I love McCloud’s metaphor of art and words in comics like dance partners that both take turns leading and try to perform more unique and impressive moves playing off one another. It’s a fascinating look at how comics attempt to move the scale between showing and telling. ‘’ On the topic of telling, since early comics in the US was a cheap medium they needed artists who were willing to work long hours for very little pay to do the actual telling. As writes in his book , this low paying, underappreciated role attracted a disproportionate number of creative people for whom more “traditional” avenues of publishing was closed to them and primarily included ‘’. As the US has never quite embraced the idea of the “melting pot” it professes to be unless it means cultural erasure of anything incongruous to white, middle-class sensibilities, social stigmas against the identities of people such as the artists and workers behind the comic industry of the 1940’s played a role in the vilification of comics in the US. A 1940 essay, , condemned a ‘’ of comics made by people of color who illustrated superheroes deemed to be ‘’ and ‘’ Then came the book burnings. As Hajdu examines, the US wanted to return to a sense of “normal” after WWII. ‘’ writes artist , ‘’ Like what occurred with video games in the 1990s, there was a panic that comics led to violent crime, lowered literacy, were for immoral and written to seduce children into sin. Books were written making such claims, such as which was later revealed to be based on studies that were entirely fabricated. As Dave Itzkoff writes in : These fears over comics would lead to the creation of the , formed by the as an alternative to government regulation but effectively became de facto censorship. You can read the lengthy list of regulations . The CCA effectively took all the fun out of comics for adults and was the equivalent of requiring all US films to have a G rating. Stores could not legally sell any comic without a CCA stamp of approval. Of course people rebelled, and there was some amazing things happening in underground comics and it really became an outlet for queer voices during this time–the very voices still suppressed in current graphic novel publishing. Oh yea, I promised I’d talk about how “graphic novels” came to be. Get this. In the late 1980s, people realized that, while yes Zines are cool as shit, but if you took a comic and “properly” bound all the issues together like a book and slapped an ISBN number on its ass BOOM suddenly its not a comic its a novel. A graphic novel]. GENIUS. And now we have . Honestly, queer YA graphic novels have been doing some incredible things and I sometimes feel YA graphic novels are were some of the most unique aspects of US publishing are happening but mostly but uuuhhhhh yea sorry about that (IM NOT) there is a wonderful legacy of graphic novels stemming from a way to finally topple censorship. Right off the bat we had books like and and comics have never been the same. SO lets get back to McCloud because one of my favorite parts of his book is the discussion on art as a form of symbol recognition and iconography. What is really fascinating about all the various culturally-unique forms of sequential visual art (and McCloud does some great deep dives that I urge you to read) are the ways that we decode images and find them to be a language of their own. I believe comics are important because it is such a perfect way to learn visual literacy and this is something that has become very valuable and necessary going forward in a digital age where memes and emojis are able to convey wonderfully abstract ideas that carry a lot of cultural currency with them. One of the more fascinating examples he gives is the idea that simplicity of comics is useful because it goes from being a specific into a universal. He explains how, for example, we know other people’s faces in better detail than our own because we them and just have a general impression of our own. For this reason comics that have less specific detail help us inject ourselves into the characters. We see a detailed face as someone else, we see a icon of a face as ourselves. Which i really cool and comes from a long history of research into Pareidolia, which is the believed to be due to long ago instinctual needs to recognize faces for safety reasons. It is also how marketers have learned that due to putting the “face” of the car on as our driver personality mask, or that there have been studies showing , leading to theories about how the human history around personifying natural disasters or elements as dieties. I love this kind of thing, and comics play into this by making visual representations of ideas that speak just as loud as words. But I’ve talked enough (too much as usual) and you should definitely pick this book up. It is quite academic but not inaccessible and wildly fascinating. It also helps you think about art in general and how much time and space come into play in ways we don’t typically pay attention to. I love sequential art and I will be urging this book on people for years to come."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Great book, but I'm too annoyed to give it four stars. It's amateurish, but I believe if you're aware of how great a book is while you're reading it, it's not working at its best. You can go 'oh wow that's such a clever way to illustrate this idea, and the text is so effective', but it's a bit like reading an instruction manual, and nothing personal or particularly poignant. I guess the idea is to understand the basic structure and potential of comic art, but must it be so academic and dry? The book doesn't limit itself to the conventional art theory, but rather ventures into fundamental epistemological and phenomenological debates. It's informative and eye opening, but not particularly relevant, like every single other art theory textbook. Except this one has pictures (or should I say, integrated with pictures?) is a misleading title, perhaps would suit the purpose of the book better. Majority of people (in terms of an audience that is likely to pick up a comic-related theory book) has little trouble understanding the intention of the drawing and writing - we can feel the atmosphere, be moved by the characters and thrilled by the action. Appreciating the history, concept and techniques that help build it up are, however, often overlooked. Much like film and literature, comics require a lot of conceptual and aesthetic decision to make it effective and communicative, and McCloud tries hard to evaluate the general methods that are used to convey these expressions. It would work better if he utilise more specific works rather than general 'rules', and most of them only applicable to mainstream comics. The last chapter goes on about the importance of 'understanding', and how comics can serve as a great tool of communication. Frankly it is a bit arrogant to me. No matter what your medium - ink and paper, music, written words, motion picture, performance, construction, we as the audience give ourselves far less credit when apprehending these art forms. We are subjected to arbitrary education, test and criticism that are meant to 'guide' our 'understanding' of the creator's concept and execution - how to read them, how to properly experience them, how to get the most of it like the artist 'wants' us to. I feel as though McCloud is saying, 'I'm the creator, and you are the reader. Through these lines and colour, I'm telling you what is being expressed. Do you get it? DO YOU GET IT?'. Fuck this I don't have understand everything in order to appreciate it, have you never read Pynchon or seen anything David Lynch? Comic art is merely another form of story telling, it is equally capable of being as representational or avant-garde as any other art form. 'Understanding comics is serious business' - why is it serious? why not just go out and say 'respecting comics is serious business'. McCloud also comments on how the merit of comics lies in its ability to convey 'individual voices' through mass production - really now? If you want personal expression, why not read a few blogs, talk to strangers in the park, speaker's corner, open mic, go to a concert, underground gig, restaurant, flickr, public toilet, open market, join whatever radical societies there are out there? It is almost ridiculous to have to remind people that comics are capable of being expressionistic, and please don't try to say your choice of material expresses something more profound, original than the others or with more efficiency. Why the fuck should it be efficient? Aren't you arguing that comics can be art too? Then why should it be readable, straightforward and commercial like everything else? GAH I'm angry! What McCloud is saying is that as an artist you have more control over the output. But at least for me, I don't care if you came up with the entire concept or worked in a team as long as the outcome is insightful and fun. And then he started talking about the human condition and how we can fix the world with reading more comics. YEAH. And then there are angels reading comics, statues of bullied comic readers, massive yin yang symbol! montage of great art works! The world map! Epic lightening! 'THE TRUTH WILL SHINE THROUGH'! (real quote) That goes on for about 20 pages. Dear comic art - Don't overestimate yourself, not because you're insignificant. Yes you have a long history indeed, and we 'understand' you're not just some flat tone sexist superhero adventure, and that you can be as postmodern as any other art school asshole graduate. Message received. *Picture above: single panel from Moebius' I don't get it, but it's awesome."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Understanding Comics is a comic about comics by Scott McCloud. I remember when this book came out in 1993. My fifteen year old self scoffed. ""I've been reading comics for years. What can this book teach me?"" Twenty five years later and a thousand comics later, on the heels of rereading Zot!, I decided to finally give it a shot. I was apprehensive at first since you really have to scrape to find a negative review of Understanding Comics. Did so many people like it or were they afraid to admit they didn't? Understanding Comics traces the origin of comics back to the ancient Egyptians and other pre-Columbian people. This might be a bit of a stretch but McCloud explains himself fairly well. More interesting to me was the explanation of the mechanism of comics and how they work on the human brain, like the gutter in between panels and the visual language of comics. While I found a lot of the book interesting, I think your enjoyment level of Understanding Comics will depend on why you read comics. If you read them because they fascinate you and you see them as an art form, this is your book. If you read them for escapism and entertainment, parts of Understanding Comics will feel like someone reading you the nutritional information of your food while you're eating it. Remember the part in the beginning of Dead Poet Society when Professor Keating has them tear a section out of their textbook? Some of the more analytical parts of the book feel like the good Professor would have turned them into confetti, like the three axes of The Picture Plane, Reality, and Meaning, or graphing scene transitions into Moment to Moment, Action to Action, Subject to Subject, Scene to Scene, Aspect to Aspect, and Non-Sequitur. All that being said, knowing why things are the way they are and why they work was more than worth my time. Not only that, it shows Scott McCloud's skill as a writer and artist that he took a subject that could have been drier than a desert and made it fun and interesting. I expect I'll be dipping back into it from time to time, along with How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way. Four out of five stars."

So much so that it increased my love and understanding of comics I read in the past and definitely comics I will read in the future. As I was reading other peoples reviews and discussions about this book I noticed that most people are intrigued with the idea that the simpler the character on the page is, the easier it is for the reader to identify with the character. This is something that I noticed myself long before I read this book, so it wasn't so revolutionary to me... BUT his chapter on time and expressing time in space in comics truly blew my mind when I read it. It made me see and truly understand so much about pacing in comics. It helped me form, what I like to call, my internal gear shift. As a reader I didn't focus on speed of my reading and over time the only speed for reading became as fast as possible, but in comics this can be a huge disadvantage especially when going through slower and more solemn scenes. Now when I see a comic page and take a look at the composition of the panels I know when the story demands of me to go faster or slower and I am grateful for this new found knowledge. This book is an excellent start for anyone who wants to learn about comics, and I certainly will continue my research on this topic."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Holy shit! I'm starting a graphic novel book club!! This is our inaugural book and I'm so excited!!! We had our first meeting today, and in addition to saying terribly intelligent things about comics and eating mini-cupcakes and laughing at my dogs, we also picked a name for our (accidentally all-female) group: Jugs & Capes. I know you're very jealous. Anyway, I was extremely impressed by this book. I can tell that Scott McCloud thinks that he is terrifically important and probably a genius, but, as often happens to me, I was willing to believe that at least he was smart enough to have earned the right to talk about all of this. So while there were a few points when I found him a bit condescending, a bit cloyingly didactic, on the whole I learned a lot about comics and how to think about them, and that was great. I though I was going to write about some of the things I learned, but it's late and I'm tired, and honestly one of the things he does best is really use the illustrations and the text in the best symbiotic way, enhancing and augmenting one another throughout, and so it seems like it would be reductive and dismissive for me to try to summarize his points with words alone. So read the book! And then you'll get it for yourself. (Oh but except for one thing, which is so cool I just have to share it. He talks a lot about how the reader is complicit in the telling of a comic story, because so much happens between the panels -- in the gutter, where the reader has to invent what is going on to connect one image to another. He uses as an example a panel with an axe-wielding man chasing another guy and shouting, ""Now you're going to die!"" Then the next panel is the outside of a building, with only an ""Aieeee!!"" screaming out. Anyway [see my point, how much extra describing I have to do just to get to what he does with like two pictures?], he then says: ""To kill a character between panels is to condemn him to a thousand deaths."" See? Because each reader will make his/her own decision about when and how the axe falls, how much blood comes out, how many strikes are needed, the specific choreography of the death. Amazing!)"
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},Fantastic. I learned a lot about comics but also about writing more widely.
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I really appreciate that this book exists. It's nice that something was created to help people understand the language of comics, what they are, what they can be, what makes them special, and so forth. That said, there are parts which are a little convoluted (Chapter 2, I'm looking at you), and there are parts that are a little dated by now (such as the chapter on color, which I think has come a long way since the early '90s, particularly due to the use of computers). But there are so many parts that articulate things that we as readers may have never realized we were doing (such as reading between the panels, as discussed in Chapter 3). I think McCloud did a great job of including all kinds of comics, from Schultz to Spiegelman to Lee/Kirby to Otomo, without placing more value on one than another. I also liked the parallels he drew between comics and other art forms, although he emphasized visual arts far more than literature, which in some ways makes sense but I feel it neglects the fact that these are comic . Even in Chapter 6, which was dedicated to how language and words combine to form comics, I did not notice any analysis of how comics stand up to other forms of literature. However, in the chapter dedicated to the artistic process, I thought what McCloud had to say on the subject was so perfectly universal to all art, literature. Overall, definitely an insightful read for anyone who enjoys ""juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence."""
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I love the idea of this conversation more than I love the application--at least in this book. While I find the concepts themselves fascinating, I found the book tedious. The overall art and style employed by McCloud just wasn't compelling to me. I really struggled to finish this book. But as I said, the conversation is a good one, and the concepts explored--particularly the role of the reader and the required brain work involved in reading comics--were interesting. I'm glad this book is out there. I just wish I personally enjoyed it more."

It's like reading Roland Barthes or somebody, but in comics, which makes it easier/more fun, which I think is in keeping with Mr. McCloud's idea that comics are the best thing in the whole universe. I mean, some of his theories are a little wingnut- he basically argues that comics are the simultaneously the culmination of human achievement and the basis of it- but y'know I love me a wingnut theory. So. So yeah! I am going to be on the lookout for the next ones AND for McCloud's non-meta (is there a prefix that means not-meta?) comics."

What I found in the pages of this book is an excellent explanation of what happens to us as we read comics, how our mind interprets information and the effect it has on our consciousness. I also feel that this book makes an excellent argument to anyone who looks down on comics as ""something for kids"" or overly ""nerdy."" McCloud explains that comics are a much more prevalent part of our culture/society than we may immediately recognize, and what ensues is evidence of the medium as an art form, ripe with theory and rich creativity. I feel that anyone who has an interest in philosophy/theory, filmmaking, history, painting, photography, or literature/writing should read this book.

When trying to review a comic or graphic novel, I find it easy to talk about plot but talking about the art is difficult. I picked up Understanding Comics because there is so much to learn and I wanted a better grasp on the art form. And it is art, it might not be as highbrow as artists like Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet or my personal favourite Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, but it is still art. To exclude comics as an art form would be like removing Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Jackson Pollack or René Magritte from the art world because you 'don't get it'. Now that I have had a little rant about art, let’s talk about comics and by Scott McCloud. This book is a graphical look into comics as an art form, exploring the history of comics and tries to explain the meaning behind the art. It starts off trying to define what a comic is, which I quickly realised was an impossible feat. McCloud ended saying ” but then went on to explain how problematic that definition can be. A highlight for me was found in chapter two where Scott McCloud explored the vocabulary of comics. The chapter begins with explain René Magritte’s painting (1928-29), an artist I am a big fan of. I actually went to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the hope to see , but it was currently on loan to the Art Institute of Chicago. What I liked about this chapter was how he took the meaning of this painting and expanded on it to help explain comics. He took something easy to explain and built upon that to the more complex ideas. Reading s makes comics sound like highbrow pieces of art and maybe that is how we should view them. Instead of thinking about comics as a lowbrow medium, it is about time we experience the art and what it can tell us. In this book six major ideas around the art. Idea/purpose, form, idiom/style, structure, craft and surface; explaining how they can all work together to make great pieces. There is a lot of information within and I don’t think I have explored it all yet. It has equipped me with some new tools when reading and reviewing comics. The best thing about this book is the way Scott McCloud changes his art style and methods to explore the different ways you can execute the theories behind this book. I am glad he referenced all his work, especially when talking about other artists and how they write comics. The graphical representation of the art theory in the book helped me to understand comics a little better but there is just so much here that I will need to reread this a few times before it sinks in.

McCloud wrote this at a time when the artistic merit of comics/graphic novels was still in doubt in some corners, so clearly that animates a lot of the discussion. He really demolishes any doubt about their legitimacy, and in the process created quite a comic himself. Understanding Comics is one phenomenal piece of analysis and it's far more than just a treatise on one medium. His meditations on comic forms and how they're created and received could more often than not be applied to any other artistic endeavor. This is clearly the work of someone who's done some heavy intellectual lifting, and the medium is lucky to have him as it cheerleader."

There were all sorts of clever ways in which he could use the very medium of his exposition to offer insight into comics. But when he launched himself into generalities about the importance of comics, the nature of artistic creation, language and meaning, etc., it felt piously conventional and not sufficiently analytical.

While it presents some fairly complex ideas of ""how comics work"" McCloud uses the medium itself to good effect to demonstrate his meaning. I, do however, have to take issue with his strangely vociferous insistence that one panel cartoons are not comics - while I loathe the Family Circus as much as the next thinking person, I think McCloud is too hung up on the literal need for sequential panels for something to be a comic. There is an sequence to one-panel cartoons - an imagined before and after - that make them work, much in the way that the gutter between panels in more conventional comics imply a connecting action that the reader actively engages with in order to fulfill (and go beyond) the promise of static images. It seems to me that the one-panel cartoon functions exactly in the way that McCloud asserts all comics do, it is just that everything else that panel is the gutter."

That's a mistake. I hadn't heard of this before I started the Coursera course I'm doing on comics, but I don't need any prompting to take it seriously.

McCloud is an engaging narrator, although the first chapter is a little dry. He's defining what comics ""are"", so that probably can't be helped. As some other reviewers have noted, the technology has advanced since McCloud wrote this in the early 90's (particularly, I'm guessing, when it comes to color), but the ideas are still contemporary. A few of the things I learned, or what I learned to look at with new eyes: --How different types of lines can convey different emotional states --What closure is (how we automatically fill-in the narrative gaps between panels) --The space between panels, btw, is called ""the gutter"" --The different types of transitions between panels, e.g action-to-action, aspect-to-aspect, et cetera. McCloud has a great graph selection in chapter three breaking this down. Manga, for instance, is very big in the aspect transition. --Some of the differences between Western and Japanese comics, both in terms of artistic and narrative choices. Try as I might, I can't get into anime or manga, but this was fascinating. I like how McCloud sets out to link comics to ""higher"" arts here and seriously, you can never go wrong with name-dropping Kandinsky. I haven't read Eisner's book on the subject, but I think most comics readers will find something new here. I know I'm going to read my latest comic book score with new eyes. On the subject of being out of date, McCloud has written two more recent books on this same subject: Reinventing Comics and Making Comics."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A fabulous and totally unexpected delight. I came to this book after reading McCloud's The Sculptor, so I already knew that he had a firm grip on how to produce an outstanding comic. I thought I was getting an Eisner or Kirby style How-To guide for the craft and business of comics writing, and instead was treated to a brilliant treatise on art history, human perception, the role of symbols in communication, and how we use art to communicate with one another. Understanding comics *is* a How-To guide, but the camera is at 30,000 feet, providing a strategic and conceptual understanding of how comic book art and writing work, and how an artist/writer can position themselves to not only make great art on a one-off basis, but over the course of a career. It also provides a reader with no aspirations to create with a deep and rich understanding of the medium and its importance in the world of art and literature. I will never look at a comic book the same way again, and assure you that you won't either. McCloud has an exhaustive knowledge of comics history and a true and sober appreciation of the importance of the genre. Even if you're not a comic fan at all, this book will leave you with a better appreciation of art and how we use it to know we're not alone."

I feel like I learned a lot but there's some I still wish was explored, and I think a second installment of this would be fun to explore webcomics and the way the internet generally has expanded comic production and spread, esp. regarding the chapter about colour. (guess i should read .) I do wish the etymology/linguistics aspect was explored more in terms of philosophy/what we consider a ""comic"" - especially because comic also relates to comedy, and I think there's a lot to explore with where that overlaps with comics and where it doesn't. I also wanted to hear more about non-western styles and how different places and cultures influence each other, but maybe that's just beyond the scope of this. Regardless, really glad I finally got around to reading this!"

I've been reading comics again as an adult for a decade, and reading them critically since I got my GoodReads account (6? years). I've followed comics critics on comics sites, blogs and podcasts, followed the ebb and flow of popularity of creators and their styles through all my fellow reviewers here... and I *still* have a hard time taking in all of McCloud's thoughts from this book. I took three months to pick away at this book - dense as it is, I found I could only take in a chapter or few pages at a time. And yet one still reeling from the self-induced pressure to keep all of McCloud's ideas and arguments in my head. I'm supremely motivated because I'll be giving a talk to a SIG-CHI audience in a few months on the UX of comics storytelling - so I'm trying very hard to pull all of this together and think beyond McCloud to my own perspectives on the medium. But holy hell, I could probably just deliver the high points of his treatise here and still come off like a cerebral expert on comics. Yes, this book is that good. Makes me a better comics reader (if I can retain all these critical approaches), and makes me recognize there are reasons for some of the tools and expressions being used by some of the creators whose works I find harder to appreciate. McCloud does a stellar job of making his points through the illustrations and sequencing he performs himself (or borrows from historical giants), so this book makes it damned easy to see what he's trying to say. Sometimes it's all just a little much though - if I had one complaint, it's that by using the comics approach itself here, it makes it hard to see the natural breaks in his ideas. There are no obvious paragraph markers to give my brain a rest (even the chapter headings barely give me a chance to catch my breath, what with the endless progression of panels from one page to the next. The best part of this book? Summarizing all the theses in the final chapter, so I feel like there's some hope of remembering at least the main points. Well done."

Rather brilliantly, McCloud uses the medium of comics itself for a philosophical meditation on the nature and possibilities of comics. He does reflect a little bit on the prehistoric and pre-modern origins of comics, but this is not a history lesson. Rather, he explores the specific nature of comics as sequential art and the potential of the form to explore new modes of expression. It's really super smart art and literary criticism made fun and digestible through using comics. I highly recommend for everyone, even if you've never thought about picking up a graphic novel."

A comic artist talked about this book at a professional development event I went to during November and it sounded like a really good way to get English teachers on board with supporting kids reading comic books because based on what the artist said, this book breaks comics down into their parts and tells you how to read them. And, like, that's KIND OF what it does? But it does it more from the perspective of an artist who's going to be creating comics, talking about how you convey time passing or complex emotions or any number of other things in ART rather than discussing it from the perspective of a reader. Still, the discussion of the differences in comics and methods of storytelling between the US, Europe and Japan was definitely interesting and something I hadn't thought about before. Add in the fact that it was quite academic and dry in terms of the writing and this was definitely an INTERESTING read, but for me it wasn't a particularly ENGAGING read. And honestly? I think the Media Studies staff at work will find this much more useful than the English staff..."

Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Think you understand comics? Think again! Author and illustrator Scott McCloud has created a unique educational graphic novel that can be read for pure enjoyment but also could be used in college-level courses that teach the art of illustration. I have known about this book for several years, as it was originally written in 1993, but reading it seemed daunting. But when a certain erudite blogger suggested that I read it, not once but twice, I had to give it a go. Divided into nine chapters, McCloud first begins with ascertaining how to define comics. After using accurate but long definitions, he uses comic’s giant Will Eisner’s short definition: comics are sequential art. Since cartoons can sometimes be considered a lesser art form, McCloud puts cartooning in a bigger framework- he goes back in time to show how hieroglyphics and picture manuscripts have evolved into comics. There is a rich history that provides the building blocks for this “new” art medium of today. Once we push past the history of comics, we move into the parts that make the whole. How vocabulary is incorporated into comics is addressed as is the effective use of gutters in a sequence. These frames form closure to an idea, and a thought is imparted. How lines are utilized got a chapter, with some perceptive thoughts on how lines can convey feelings and moods. I thought his comment about how Rob Liefeld’s “hostile and jagged” lines expressed the anxieties of those growing up in the 90s quite accurately. And it’s true! Image Comics broke away from Marvel at the time when Gen X was at its most angsty, and these artists had a new style of drawing that obviously met a need. While most of this graphic novel was in black and white, a chapter on color used it sparingly to make several points. Color can be used to set a mood, establish a scene and add depth. Adding color can expand the reader’s experience and artists continue to experiment with different palettes to establish atmosphere. I also appreciated how McCloud moved beyond the parts that make up a cartoon- he also looked at the big idea. Art has meaning and he ties it into resemblance and the picture plane. There are so many ways to impart representation in styles such as surrealism, expressionism, cubism and impressionism. Words and pictures have great power when harnessed together and artists have freedom in how to create their works of art, which includes cartooning. To make an Infinity Gauntlet comparison, cartoonists will use space, line, color, closure, words and icons to help them get their message across. These “gems” are the building blocks of effective illustration. Reading this book took me quite awhile, as its information-heavy narrative could overwhelm me at times. But I stuck with it and the knowledge that I picked up has made me look at comics with new appreciation. Already a fan of cartoons and graphic novels, McCloud’s astute analysis and deconstruction of this art form further elevated the genre for me. This review (plus pictures!) can be found on my blog:"
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Scott McCloud explores the form, history, and potential of comics for consumers and creators, speaking to the reader via a flexible, clever cartoon avatar. I was expecting something both intelligent and fluffy, but WOW, is this dense. There's a lot (by my standards) of art history, comics history, even some anthropological history. McCloud covers an abundance of fundamental concepts and illustrates them beautifully. Concepts and definitions: juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence. --use of simple, cartoonistic characters against more realistic backgrounds, allowing readers to ""mask"" themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world. --A photoreal picture represents a specific person; a cartoonish picture represents all. The more cartoony a face, the more people it describes. --The phenomenon of observing parts but perceiving the whole (eg object permanence); the phenomenon of filling in the space between panels to connect the panels. : 1. moment-to-moment 2. action-to-action 3. subject-to-subject 4. scene-to-scene. 5. aspect-to-aspect 6. non-sequitur. --When a panel runs off the edge of the page. Expands time, conveys timelessness. --A moving figure or figures imposed over a continuous background. ""The longer any form of art or communication exists, the more symbols it accumulates. The modern comic is a young language but it already has an impressive array of recognizable symbols. Stink lines, x-eyes, sweat beads"" ""The art form of comics is many centuries old, but it's perceived as a recent invention and suffers the curse of all new media:the curse of being judged by the standards of the old."" --Text-heavy, pictures are merely accents. --Illustrations tell the story; words merely add a soundtrack. --The words and illustrations are redundant. --Words and pictures amplify one another. --The words and pictures are not obviously related. --Words are part of the picture. --The most common type. Words and pics go hand in hand to convey what would be impossible alone. Update: Bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars. I find myself referring back to it over and over."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This one's a classic, of course. There were many eye opening moments to me in here. The part about the cartoon face being a representation of how we see ourselves really blew my mind, especially that when we see two dots and a line that, not only can we make a face out of it, we have to. And how the more simplistic the representation, the more universal it is to the reader. I also like how he illustrated how our minds fill in the space between panels to create our own continuity. With comic art becoming more and more realistic, I think about his argument that comics is more about a marriage of art and writing with it's own language, than about an artist and writer going off in their own directions, creating the ultimate in their fields, then coming together to do a comic. I wonder how much this is true. I remember when I read the first Ultimate Fantastic Four, the photo realistic art felt stiff and alien to me at first, but I think over time it grew on me. Now that I think of it, maybe he wasn't talking so much about the art style as the layout and flow of the page. It definitely gave me a new appreciation of comics and peeled back the layers to see what's going on subconsciously. Stuff that's innately human. I think that's why this book is so universal and would be more widely read if our culture could get past the stigma of comics."

His arguments are sadly uncritical, unsubstantiated, and poorly made. The real value this book has is that a lot of comics scholars have responded to the sloppy thinking and slippery points with intelligent, sophisticated articles of their own. It's as though McCloud wasn't aware there was a large body of work on aesthetics, communications, literature in society, pop culture, or film studies when he wrote this book. And its format (presentation as a comic) does not in and of itself validate its content, despite the rhetorical tricks at play."

Namely, that comics are a legitimate art form in their own right and those who ignore this fact do so at their own risk.

Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"WOW!!! I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW SHIT!!!!! ..I apologize for starting this thing off with a curse word. I usually don't curse when doing a book review unless it's a book that is really awful. It's just that; I've been reading comic books since I was a little kid, I've been drawing since I was a little kid and decided that I wanted to pursue comic book illustration at a very young age, I went to a very prestigious and well known comic book/cartooning school, and now am a professional doing freelance comic book work as well as other freelance art jobs. It's just that Scott McCloud really opened my mind and got me to think about the whole thing differently. He really knows a lot, I first purchased this book about ten years ago while in art school because I had been told about it by other students/aspiring professionals. I don't remember why, but I started reading it and never got to finish it. I kind of feel bad about that, but I'm just glad that I finally just read the whole thing. This is basically a comic book history/art history/theory book about the medium of sequential art. I kind of think that when people who don't read comic books read this thing, they don't realize they are reading a comic book right away. Then when they are a quarter of the way through, they are delightfully surprised to find out that they are reading a comic book about comic books. I'm sure a similar thing happens to regular comic book readers too. I like a lot of what Scott had to say. He explores the definition of what a comic book is. Praises for writing a book similar to this before Scott did, and how his work had a powerful impact on the way comic books are done and looked at today. He explores the history of comic books, pointing out how debatable when the art form was first created and leaves it further open for debate. Talks about the magic of storytelling, which is what the medium is really about (not just guys running around in spandex and beating the shit out of criminals...LOL). The Chapter titled, ""The Six Steps"", both impressed and made me cringe. Mostly I cringed at the part where he talks about how people decide to become comic book illustrators (or Cartoonists, whichever term you prefer to use...that's another topic he gets into). It was like, ""Oh, he just showed a kid reading an comic, and then the kid went and practiced and practiced until he made a cool picture of Wolverine...AAAGH, that was me when I was fourteen!"" There was other stuff he talked about, common mistakes that professionals make, and I was like, ""damn, I just did that one recently"". He also showed you how the kid who drew the picture of Wolverine was told that he was good, so then he took his stuff to a comic-con only to be told by a professional that he needed to work on certain things. I've been through that too, but that part didn't make me cringe. Everyone who sets out to do this goes through that. I also like to think I have a thicker skin now. I think most professionals who have read this, have looked at it the same way. Noticed things they had been through or mistakes they had made, and even discovered things they didn't know and began to look at the medium differently. For instance, one of my favorite artists and inspirations...a British guy who's been working in the comic book industry since the 70's wrote a book called , in which he showcases a lot of the great work he's done over the years, talks about his career as well as his personal life (I love that book). But, in the beginning, he talks about his experience reading this book... I liked Scott's definition of what he considers to be art (I'm not going to put any spoilers to that in here). It's pretty broad, but it works. And makes you think. I think that's the whole point of this book....Scott wants you to really . I like the way he ended the book. There's just so many possibilities with what can be done with this medium. This thing was written in 1992, and in 2000 he came out with a sequel called . I'm going to have to read that one next. I do have his other book, , which is supposed to be like an instructional book for aspiring comic book artists, but like with this one, he tries to get you to . Unfortunately my copy of that was ruined when my basement flooded one time (no, that did not happen in Hurricane Sandy), so I have to get a new copy. Scott McCloud is a great artist and storyteller. He can draw in different styles from super cartoony to super realistic, as well as mimic other styles. He probably knows more about how comic book story telling works more than anyone except for the late Will Eisner. I used to not like Manga books. It wasn't that I hated them, it was just that I thought, ""it's just not my thing"". And a friend once told me that I was being narrow minded about Manga. Scott talks about Manga and how it's actually had an influence on western styled comics and points out what's good about it as well. I still don't think I was being narrow minded before by not wanting to read it, but now I think I'm going to give it a chance. I think the best thing about this book is that it lit a fire under my ass. I thought I was already taking it seriously, but now I'm even more serious about . I have to go read Scott's other books now. I have to really study Will Eisner's books more than I was before to become a better storyteller. I got a lot out of this book, but I feel like I'm going to have to go back and re-read it at least one or two more times to really wrap my head around it. Whether you are an artist or just a person who likes to read comic books, this book is prerequisite for you. Go read it, I wish I had done so years ago."

From the drawings to the writing and the correlation of the two, we get to see what it is about this format that attracts the reader and how that is the focus of the creators. It also explains why this is anything but a trivial form; so much thought goes into every aspect. For example, the width of the panels, their orientation and the gap between each successive panel can indicate a range of things about the story, including the lapse of time and even different emotions! Something I had never really thought was significant before but I now realise how while reading, these things do register. Informative and entertaining."

If you are really into comics then most of this will be old news, and if you don't know anything about comics at all it might be overkill.

Rather I'm here to tell you whether the book is worth reading. What the book is about is self-explanatory as the title says it all in very plain language. Written in 1992, I had wondered whether this much-lauded book was worth reading as I thought it might be out-dated and irrelevant by this time. It is certainly worth reading and probably required reading for anyone who considers themselves more than just a casual comics reader. It is outdated in some parts when the author talks about comics in the present and future as that was twenty-five years ago and during that time comics have come a long way as McCloud predicts they might. The outdated parts are immaterial though as much of the book is about the history, appreciation, comprehension and techniques of comics. (both the writing and reading of). One thing I really enjoyed was that the author takes into account the difference between North American/European comics and Japan. Japanese comics evolved in a totally different manner due to their isolation for many years, but at the time of writing the Western world was just starting to employ some of the Asian techniques and now, of course, manga is translated into English (and other languages) and widely read throughout the world. At first I thought the book could do with a second edition updating the nineties content and continuing the story to modern times but I have since found that Mr McCloud has written two more books on this topic, one in 2000 and the other in 2006, which I assume will fill that hole and I'm quite anxious to read them now. Understanding Comics is a must-read for anyone even slightly serious about comics."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I never had any intention of taking the graphic-novel class here at Brown, but I had every intention of taking my roommate's textbooks for class and reading them on my own time. I hadn't gotten around to it yet when my playwriting professor assigned a big, photocopied chunk of this to us for reading - ""Though it's about comics,"" he said, ""there's a lot to be learned here for playwrights, too."" I decided just to read the whole book, since my friend Momo had also read it and recommended it enthusiastically. I certainly liked it - it was clear and concise, funny but not overly so, and really made me think about the nature of comics in a different way. The reason I'm giving this three rather than four stars is that it felt a little weak on the content side - McCloud spends so much time trying to prove that comics are a real art form that there's not much room left for exploring it. I enjoyed this, but don't know how much practical information I'm actually walking away with. The title here is ""Understanding Comics"", but I feel like my understanding of comics was merely augmented rather than completed, as McCloud never seems to decide whether he wants to focus on comics' history or the differences in international styles or why comics matter at all. Nonetheless, this was a quick-enough read that it was fully worth what I got out of it: some interesting explorations of time between scenes--valuable information for anyone crafting a story--and the relationship between icons, art, and language."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What I love about this book is how reverently its author, comic writer Scott McCloud, treats the subject. Comics? An underappreciated genre that's looked down upon as pedestrian in every way -- something for the masses only? Not when an author explains the genre as if he were a professor and comics were the erudite topic of his course. You learn the nitty (and, as required by law, the gritty) about comics, panels, word balloons, gutters (the space between panels), time, motion, icons, symbols, history, eastern comics (chiefly Japan's) vs. western, history (cave drawings to giants of the genre like Herges, Osamu Tezuka, Carl Barks, Jaime Hernandez, Jack Kirby, Charles Schultz, etc.), emotions, depiction of the senses, and (my favorite) closure -- how readers do so much work (but think it's all play) by deducing what's going on not only IN panels but in between them (which truly puts readers minds in the ""gutters""). If you're thinking of going into the field, this book will provide some of the basics of light, perspective, color, and so forth. The six steps to creating comics are no different than the six steps to creating ""painting, writing, theatre, film, sculpture, or any other form"": Idea/Purpose, Form, Idiom, Structure, Craft, and Surface. If you just want to learn more about the genre as a reader, teacher, or student, there's much to be gleaned here as well. It is all explained in detail through the medium of comics itself. Neat idea, eh?"
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"March 31, 2022 Liked it just as much or more the second time around. Such an impressive book not just for anyone interested in comics, but for art in general. It's so much more philosophical than I remember it being. I particularly loved chapter seven and his breakdown of the 'six steps' of art: idea, form, idiom, structure, craft, and surface. He uses several hypothetical people to illustrate the different career paths (or steps) that different artists may choose. One person might be content to work as a draftsperson without needing to produce their own work (craft), while another might want to push the envelope of what's been accomplished before (structure), culminating in the existential angst of the person who finally asks, 'why am I doing this? Do I have anything to say at all?' (So relatable.) I came to comics pretty late, not being attracted to the superhero stories for kids (although I do love me some Batman), but I've really enjoyed dipping into the wide variety of comics available for adults these days. This book has totally changed the way I'll look at those comics now. McCloud goes through everything from the history of comics to the importance of colour, style, and writing. It's also given me a huge list of new artists to check out. And how brilliant is it to write a history of comics, in comic book form?!"

There is something magical about learning about Comics in a book written as a Comic. I took my time with it, reading slowly and letting the ideas sink in, and you know what? It has enhanced the way I read graphic novels! I have long felt that Comics can often convey many concepts better than prose, and I've struggled to understand why that is. This books helped me to understand. I see things that I was blind to before. You know that old adage, you see what you are prepared to see? Well, my eyes have been opened, and I cannot tell you how excited I am to begin the Comic Books and Graphic Novels Coursera course in a couple of weeks. I would recommend this nonfiction book to anyone interested in learning about Comics History, and it should be required reading for those of us that read Comics on a regular basis."

I was struggling with a box and asked what's in it, and he replied that he has a lot of photography books. I mockingly argues that most adults graduate from picture books. On Monday he loaned me this book. I didn't make the connection until I reached the part where McCloud argues against considering comics a lower form of art because they use images. Other than this 99% irrelevant anecdote, Understanding Comics is an enjoyable read, light but surprisingly well researched and thoughtful. It was quite nice to explore some of the conventions of comics (such as the representation of time or movement) in an almost didactic way - it took me back to uni classes on culture and media. Someone who is already a serious comics fan will probably appreciate it more, but it's also suited to the ""layman"" / occasional reader of one or two random comics. I have to say, my friend wasn't wrong with his recommendation."

This was 200 pages of having things most humans already inherently understand explained a million different ways. I feel like a better title would be ""An argument for why comics should be allowed to be pretentious garbage like every other form of art"" because ""understanding comics"" made me think this was going to be a fun romp through different techniques comic book artists use to communicate ideas and a maybe fun history of comics. And sure, you get some of that, but you mostly get this weird argument that all these other forms of art (like cave paintings) are practically comics and therefore comics deserve more respect. I honestly couldn't care less if comics are respectable. Let pretentious assholes think they're better than me. You don't need to make comics seem pretentious to make their existence valid."

Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Excellent introduction to comics, that does not only tell about the complete history of the medium (in the eyes of the narrator beginning either somewhat 3.000 years ago or in the 19th century), but - which is much more interesting - about the various characteristics that make it what it is and that make it so special. The chapters cover topics like the ""language"" of comics - ranging from symbols to words, from pictures to abstract concepts and ideas, with a captivating digression about symbolism, Marshall McLuhan, and the idea of the identification between reader and author -, the very important concept of time and its relation to space, colorisation, emotions, methods of visualizing movement and much, much more. Everything is presented and explained very clearly and with a good dose of humour, while - and that is always very important to me personally - never being goofy. The chapter i found most fascinating was probably ""Blood in the gutter"", which deals with the blank space between two comic pannels and from there goes on towards a whole analysis about the human brain's capability of induction, of filling the gap with our own ideas and the different ways the panels can relate to each other. Downright fascinating. I never cared for comics at all, condemning them as nothing else than children's entertaintment and ""not real literature"". Due to concentrating on topics concerning magick, narration, imagination and the effect reality and fiction have on each other - in fact how fiction can completely alter reality and stories being living entities - , i stumbled upon the world of comics and this book was recommended to me. I do not exaggerate when i say it opened a completely new perspective for me and i might start to enjoy comics in the future. The first batch is ordered already. The are only two small details that can maybe fall under ""criticism"". The first one being my ecpectations. In German the book is called ""How to read commics correctly"". And that is what i expected, an instruction on how to get the most enjoyment, learning effect and in the end ""experience"" out of my reading, a ""How to on comics for newcomers"". While this would usually upset me a lot, the actual book in the end was so good that i did not care too much anymore and almost forgot my initial intentions. I rarely experience that, generally when a book does not meet my expectations i have a hard time to give it a good rating. Well done. The second, rather insignificant point i cannot agree on is the author's definition of art, being literally ""everything that is not reproduction or surviving instinct"". I politely dare to disagree, i do not call it art when somone is making a sound by banging a stone against another. My idea of art is ""slightly"" more conservative. But that's completely fine, i do not have to agree with everything and this tiny detail did neither belittle my enjoyment nor the learning experience i had with this book, reading through the 200 pages in less than 3 days. It opened my eyes to a whole new world that might become a new, enriching and enchanting part of my own, that i look very much forward to."

This book delves into epistemology-like concepts and validates the need for comics as a medium to communicate to the reader. Beautifully done with meta examples directed at the reader to show, and not tell a point. Here are a few of the many nuggets learnt. What are comics: Comics are spatially juxtaposed frames, while movies are sequential in time. As a result, it can play with the essence of time to deliver a message. Power of abstraction: ""When we abstract an image through cartooning, we’re not so much eliminating details as we are focusing on specific details, by stripping down an image to its essential meaning, an artist can amplify that meaning in a way that realistic art can’t."" This idea of abstraction in storytelling is also reinforced in Stephen King's book On Writing when he gave advice that ""Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finishing in reader's"". Differences between East and West cultures manifested in comics: The goal oriented western culture always focuses on getting there as opposed to being there unlike Japanese comics. As a result, western comics (and arguably many action movies) always focus on action-to-action transitions as compared to aspect-to-aspect transitions that bypasses time and sets a wandering eye on different aspects of a place or mood. I think this book will be a great read for anyone who wants to learn how to communicate better through any medium, the same principles and concepts apply. For product folks out there, I think building tech consumer products is like telling a compelling story with transitions, hooks and twists, the fundamental concepts you get from this book might very well elevate your understanding of interaction and communication of your app or website. Last meta note: The author spends a lot of time vindicating the strengths of comics in telling a story through a comic book medium nonetheless. This limits the target audience to people who are already interested in comics, less so in people who still believe comics are for kids, or are cartoons. Perhaps to communicate such arguments, he might have to convince them through a more traditional medium."
Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102920.Understanding_Comics/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have only read a few books (or volumes) in the medium of comics, and up to now have mostly dismissed the medium as not really for me, thinking it didn't satisfy me in a visual/audio way the way TV & movies do, nor in an imagination-based immersive, wordy way like novels do. However, I have always suspected that I was reading them in the 'wrong' way, rushing through and focusing disproportionately on the words and story, but worrying too much about how much it could cost (financially) to try and fully dive in. Having now read this, I am really excited to try reading more as I have learnt a lot! It is an excellent, fascinating book really well put-together that covers various aspects of the art involved in creating comics - the historical context; the development of words v pictures and how they connect; the techniques used to convey the unseen such as the passage of time, motion, emotions, the four senses other than visual; consideration of the role the reader themselves has to play (e.g. in establishing 'closure'); the differences between the development of comic art in Japan compared to that in the West; a little about colour.... I was never someone who looked down on comics as inferior to other arts (an assumption McCloud challenges really satisfyingly in this), it was always just something other people enjoyed, but having read this book, I have even more respect for what creators can do and can't wait to experience more of it for myself now that I can pay attention more to what's happening, and to figure out what my personal tastes might be in terms of styles and techniques, as well as genre of course."

In these comics I’m often reading stuffed being rereleased as 25th anniversary editions and there’s a lot of interesting stuff about what the comics industry was like in the early 90s. Comics artists like Jeff Smith, Dave Sim, and Art Spiegelman etc. all referencing each other in their rereleases like they’re talking about an old high school they all attended. The 90s were the absolute reinvention of the comic industry especially the indie scene. One other thing in those rereleases reference is this comic in particular. All of those aforementioned artists praising this book for giving comics a seat at the table. The book itself effectively the unspoken rules of comics and why they deserve to be taken seriously. While none of the information will blow your mind, you’ll definitely go “oh yeah, I guess that is how that works”. While still being very good, the book itself is more interesting as a staple work of the American comics pantheon. It’s inspiring to think about the littlest details and complications that comic artists think about subconsciously when creating graphic works. Personally it causes me to be very nostalgic. I kinda miss when comics were full of unbridled creativity and more respected as a self-contained medium rather than a blueprint of something unfilmed. Not to say there aren’t comics like that today, but the cultural excitement isn’t there anymore. Even if I didn’t experience it myself it’s still fun to read about."

Scott McCloud (author) used his sarcastic tone and drawings to explain what he wanted efficiently. McCloud's goal was to persuade us picture are not only meant to look good, but can convey stories and meanings just like words can if not better. McCloud uses an unusual medium (comic book) to reach an audience ranging from young children-who hopefully can understand the vocabulary-and adults who think ""I'm too old to be reading a comic book."" Because of McCloud's familiarity with the comic style, it allows him to use certain tools to make points that regular novels can't. One tool obviously being drawings. In one frame a picture could show a gun in a hand, while the next scene portrays a lady shrieking. Our brains put 1 and 1 together and we get ""she's being threatened with a gun."" See, it was not as effective writing that situation out as it was when he drew it. The next tool he used was breaking the fourth wall. In a regular novel it is a lot more difficult to realize when the characters are talking to you the reader, but in comic books the pictures and limited words go right together, letting you know when they are breaking the 4th more efficiently. Overall I think this was an incredibly interesting book...especially if you like drawing, , art, comics, or something of that sort."

Calvin and Hobbes were the very first books my mother read to me in order to teach me how to read, and they were in fact the only books, until the appearance of Captain Underpants, that she could get me to read. From the beginning Comics were to me not only a legitimate art form, they were THE art form. And looking at my reading habits that hasn't changed that much. As a form of creation comics have gotten a raw deal, and I like many people who believe in the form have my horror stories about trying to defend of justify the form to elitists and critics who can only see Mickey Mouse and spandex-clad superheroes. Understanding Comics is a boon not just to fans of comics, but to artists everywhere because it offers a validation of comics while also showing the possibilities of the medium. McClouds looks into the history and philosophy that have governed the creation of comics, taking time to understand the philosophy found between the panels of comics, the reader-repose theory that is implied in the form, the relation of writing and art to comics, and finally offers a vision for the current reality of comics while also offering hope for the future. This book isn't just an important work for lovers of comics however, because it is also a great work of non-fiction. McCloud has created an examination of an art-form that also digs into the realities of human life. Even if someone does not appreciate the medium of comics they will still find an analysis of the reasons humans create art, what are some of the strategies humans have gone about making art, why have humans created for aesthetic purposes, and what is the origin of the impulse of creation period. McCloud has constructed what I would argue is one of the most important works of Non-fiction, writing and illustrating the story of human invention through a medium that lends great power to his argument, rather than distracting from it. Understanding Comics is required reading, not just for comics lovers like myself who are sick of people using ""comic book"" as a pejorative adjective, but human beings period. This book is beautiful and every page is carefully constructed so that the writing and art work together to push McCloud's argument forward. Even if at the end of their reading the reader isn't convinced by McCloud's argument, they should still be able to appreciate the quality of it. ______________________________________________ August 19 2018 This book only gets better with every read. I feel like, every time I finish this book, I've learned more and developed even more of an appreciation for the medium of comics."

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Shortly after Melinda and I got married, I told her I was bidding on a notebook that could wind up costing a lot of money. “Don’t you already have a great portable computer?” she asked. I explained that by “notebook,” I meant the old-fashioned kind. And by “old-fashioned,” I meant old-fashioned, as in more than 500 years old. The notebook in question was one of the 32 surviving journals of Leonardo da Vinci. After I won the bid, I broke a longstanding tradition. I was supposed to change the name from Codex Hammer (the previous owner was the industrialist Armand Hammer) to Codex Gates, but I thought that sounded silly and I changed the name back to Codex Leicester, the name it held from 1719 until 1980. The Codex Leicester is not nearly as famous as artworks such as the and . And Dan Brown fans will be disappointed to know that it doesn’t contain codes protecting age-old secrets. But it’s a scientific treasure. In fact, there are insights, such as one about how blood flows through the heart, that were so far ahead of their time that researchers finally verified them only a few decades ago. Given my fascination with Leonardo, I was eager to read , Walter Isaacson’s new biography. I’ve read a lot about Leonardo over the years, but I had never found one book that satisfactorily covered all the different facets of his life and work. Walter—a talented journalist and author I’ve gotten to know over the years—did a great job pulling it all together. If you liked Walter’s major biographies of Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein, you’ll probably appreciate this one. More than any other Leonardo book I’ve read, this one helps you see him as a complete human being and understand just how special he was. He came close to understanding almost all of what was known on the planet at the time. That’s partly because scientific knowledge was relatively limited back then, partly because he had a high IQ, but mostly because he was insatiably curious about pretty much every area of natural science and the human experience. He studied, in meticulous detail, everything from the flow of water and the rise of smoke to the muscles you use when you smile. Amazingly, he did it with almost no formal schooling. His father was a notary, a profession that gave him some prominence and prosperity, so Leonardo never had to work in the fields. But because Leonardo was born out of wedlock (his mother was a poor, orphaned peasant girl), he was not sent off to school. That turned out to be a blessing. Leonardo got free time to wander, look at nature, and start creating notebooks full of observations and ideas. He became, in his own words, “a disciple of experience.” Isaacson also does a great job of explaining why Leonardo’s work is so revered. Unless you’re an art historian, you might even wonder if paintings like the are famous just for being famous. But Walter shows how Leonardo’s genius is in the details. “He became fascinated about how a smile begins to form and instructed himself to analyze every possible movement of each part of the face and determine the origin of every nerve that controls each facial muscle,” he writes. “Tracing which of those nerves are cranial and which are spinal may not have been necessary for painting a smile, but Leonardo needed to know.” Despite his remarkable artistic talent, Leonardo barely thought of himself as a painter. When he was about 30 years old, he applied for a job with the ruler of Milan. After listing interests from military engineering to science to designing sets for plays, he included almost as an afterthought, “I can also paint.” There was one downside to having such broad interests: He often switched his focus to new domains right in the middle of a project, leaving works unfinished. Here’s a classic example: After Leonardo won a coveted commission to create a large statue of a nobleman perched on a horse, Leonardo procrastinated by going down multiple rabbit roles. For example, he dissected horses to understand their anatomy, created new systems for feeding horses, and designed cleaner stables. He never completed the statue, and he never published the treatise on horses he started. When you look across all of Leonardo’s many abilities and his few failings, the attribute that stands out above all else was his sense of wonder and curiosity. When he wanted to understand something—whether it was the flow of blood through the heart or the shape of a woodpecker’s tongue—he would observe it closely, scribble down his thoughts, and then try to figure it all out. It’s a bit of a lost art these days—even though, in the age of free Wikipedia entries and YouTube videos, it’s easier than ever to satisfy your curiosity. It’s ironic that we can be reminded about the wonders of modern life by a man who lived 500 years ago."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"”Although generally considered by his contemporaries to be friendly and gentle, Leonardo was at times dark and troubled. His notebooks and drawings are a window into his fevered, imaginative, manic, and sometimes elated mind. Had he been a student at the outset of the twenty-first century, he may have been put on a pharmaceutical regimen to alleviate his mood swings and attention-deficit disorder. One need not subscribe to the artist-as-troubled-genius trope to believe we are fortunate that Leonardo was left to his own devices to slay his demons while conjuring up his dragons.” This paragraph made my blood run cold, not because I thought about how different the world would have been if Leonardo da Vinci had not been Leonardo da Vinci (tragic for sure), but because it made me wonder how many potential geniuses we are drugging into “normalcy.” Are some of the great artists and innovators of the 21st century hidden beneath the layers of a cornucopia of drugs? I remember, as a child, reading a biography of Leonardo da Vinci. I thought that he had the coolest name I’d ever heard. My name seemed so pedestrian in comparison. I was even more struck by the term that still best defines him…. I wanted to be a Renaissance man. Unfortunately, I have fallen woefully short of that title, but the eclectic books I choose to read still show that that original desire to be a well rounded person is alive and well. In an age of specialisation, I find myself to be an outlier. I am asked so many times a year...how do you know that? < Whenever I read anything about Leonardo or gaze upon his paintings/drawings, I feel that same pang felt by Antonio Salieri whenever he would read that latest music composed by Mozart. I am awed by and , but I am enamored with , the portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of the Duke Ludovico of Milan. Ludovico commissioned the painting after Cecilia gave him a son. There are so many things about this painting that arrest my attention. The alert, coiled energy of the ermine, looking as if it will jump out of the frame of the picture into my arms any second. The slight upward tilt of her lips, implying the hint of a smile. The enormous limpid eyes. The long elegant fingers that would have been a gift to a concert pianist. I can imagine the Duke coming to see her and just sitting in her rooms and watch her do...anything. While in Milan, Leonardo was also working on the famous bronze horse that was going to be three times bigger than any sculpture existing at the time. Unfortunately, this is one of the many great pieces of art by Da Vinci that was never finished, but in this case war was at fault. The bronze for his horse was used to make cannons, to no avail. The French take Milan, and troops used the clay model he had made, a masterpiece in itself, for target practice. Da Vinci left many unfinished paintings in his wake: and , just to name a few. Despite being unfinished, these paintings rocked the art world, and students flocked to see them. We have about 7,200 pages of Da Vinci’s notebooks, about a quarter of what he wrote. These notebooks are filled with sketches of inventions, few realized and most centuries ahead of their time, scribbles of ideas, doodles, and detailed drawings of his research into anatomy. Walter Isaacson absolutely loaded this volume with plates of Leonardo’s artwork, but also of pages of his notebooks. One, in particular, was very moving. I know I’ve seen this very image before, but life creates changes in all of us; something seen at 20 may not have near the impact on the same person who sees it at 50. There is something just so fragile, so human, so perfect about it that I felt overcome by the beauty of...us. He worked for a variety of powerful, diverse men, from Ludovico Sforza to Cesare Borgia to Francis the 1st of France. Leonardo was a sensitive man, but also had a very astute interest in war. He offered many times in his life to make machines of war for various patrons. So vivid, without him even picking up a brush, we know this mural would have been unsettling and would not at all idealize the splendors or nobility of war. It might have even given a psychopath like Cesare Borgia pause. I’ve read other books by Isaacson so I knew that the genius of Leonardo da Vinci was safe in the hands of the writer who has specialized in writing about some of the greatest minds in history. Da Vinci comes vividly to life in this biography and the magnificent plates scattered throughout the text of his life’s work. This is a beautiful, heavy book, printed on high grade paper, and will make the perfect gift for those of infinite curiosity.

Audiobook: The author draws heavily from Leonardo’s extensive notes, which provide a treasure trove of insights into his goals, interests, and inventions. These notes are a key asset for the biographer, offering clarity on Leonardo's diverse pursuits, from art to science. The portrayal of Leonardo as a polymath, despite his self-described 'unlettered' status, showcases his impressive intelligence and creativity. The audiobook narration highlights Leonardo’s profound engagement with empirical experimentation and observation, making his multifaceted genius accessible and engaging.

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Relentless curiosity. Careful observation. Flights of fancy grounded in reality, centuries ahead of his time. That’s Leonardo da Vinci in a nutshell. The definition of Renaissance Man. The man who gave us the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and even Madonna of Benoit (say what you want, Walter Isaacson, about it being an imperfect early work, but I loved it since I was a kid). And all those notebooks in the left-handed mirrored writing, full of insanely detailed mechanics schematics, anatomy studies, and lists underscoring how exciting the world must have been when seen by Leonardo’s sharp gaze. Walter Isaacson wrote the best biography I’ve ever read, the amazing (ant this one comes very close), and so I am happily going to use Apple “Think Different” ad when it comes to Leonardo, the one Isaacson quoted himself. Because it’s so true when applied to the Renaissance master: Had he actually made his discoveries public instead of using them for his own , as a means to satisfy that incredible thirst for knowledge, we’d probably been strolling along human-made Martian canals in a perfect city by now. Isaacson is a great biography writer. He’s both objective and yet clearly an admirer of his subject. He writes in the way that makes nonfiction feel exciting and fresh and very interesting. —————— Also posted on ."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Honestly, I preferred Serge Bramly's 1991 Da Vinci biography to this one by Isaacson. I read (and reviewed here on GR) his biographies of Einstein and Ben Franklin, and found them both really good. In the present work, the author is way too present in my opinion and pitches his Steve Jobs biography on nearly every other page. OK, I am exaggerating but only a little bit. Did I learn some stuff about my favorite Renaissance Man? Yes, I did and I did appreciate the insight into the major works and the theories about some of the lost or disputed ones as well. However, I felt the presence of Isaacson more than that of Da Vinci and would have preferred the latter over the former. Removing a star because this really was an awful excuse for a biography. At the 2019 epic exposition about Leonardo at the Louvre in Paris, only the Bramly and Vecce biographies were featured. Read those first and avoid this one. I literally asked the Louvre bookstore and they told me that they did not consider the Isaacson book accurate or worthy of promotion."

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“ How might you describe the tongue of a woodpecker?” And so it begins, in my ongoing attempt to learn more about important figures in history. This time, I turned to the latest biography by Walter Isaacson, exploring the life of Leonardo da Vinci. A man of many talents, da Vinci lived a full and exciting life as he sought to scratch the many itches that came to mind and paved the way for scores of significant discoveries. Isaacson offers a thorough and highly informative piece that will educate the reader without inflating the narrative with scores of minute facts. Isaacson presents da Vinci in three distinct lights throughout this piece: the animated artist, the inquisitive inventor, and the abstract anatomist, all of which are interconnected and help to better understand the man whose name is synonymous with so many things. Supported by an extensive collection of drawings, referenced throughout, Isaacson brings Leonardo da Vinci to life with this exceptional biography. Perfect for the curious mind and those who want a better understanding of art, history and symbolism without the dramatic scandal of a certain Robert Langdon. Leonardo da Vinci was surely one of the most animated artists of his time, if not in history. Born a left-handed bastard during the golden days of those who were conceived out of wedlock, da Vinci found his early years to be ones of independent exploration. His father refused to legitimate him, nor did he push to have the young Leonardo follow in his footsteps as a notary, which left the young da Vinci to turn to one of the other important positions of the time, an apprenticeship with a local artist. Florence was a rich locale for art and da Vinci learned his trade from many who sought to teach him how to capture the human form. However, as Isaacson denotes throughout, da Vinci chose not to capture the ‘wooden’ nature of artists at the time and sought to forge his own path by injecting curves and softer depictions of canvas creations. As he grew older, da Vinci tried to instil those beliefs in his own apprentices, with a strong focus on detail and nuance to bring the portraits to life, without falling back on a ‘sack of walnuts’ when presenting images on canvas. Isaacson references something that da Vinci wrote in one of his journals, where the master artist is said to have expressed that painting is both artistic and scientific in nature, with shading and colours that helps capture the subject from all angles. Given some key backgrounds on a number of da Vinci’s key pieces of art, Isaacson provides the reader with something that will open the mind and lead to a number of questions. Biblical references and symbols fill many of da Vinci’s works, which cannot be lost on the attentive reader, though this is more than the controversial ideas Dan Brown offers in a piece of fiction. The eager reader will be happy to see that Isaacson spent an entire chapter analysing and positing the foundations of the famed Mona Lisa, as well as speaking to its intricate detail, which combines all three personas from the biography. It is clear that da Vinci’s art is both full of detail and animated in its own right, which provides the viewer a chance to thoroughly interpret it when taking the time to absorb his vast collections found all over the world. Surely the man’s art is innovative and worthy of deep exploration, without getting stuck on too many stuffy aspects. The inquisitive nurture of da Vinci’s art work can easily be duplicated in his numerous inventions, as documented in his journals. At a time when the Renaissance was in full swing, da Vinci began to have many ideas about how he might be able to help with the new forms of artistic expression. Isaacson discusses da Vinci’s desire to help personalise some of the religious stage plays of the day, where angels had to fly from one end to the other, at a time when man and earth were sorrowfully bound together. The idea of flight and pulleys came to da Vinci, as he crafted these theoretical mechanisms. Hundreds of years ahead of his time, da Vinci had many ideas that would, at one time, find their way into the mainstream. Isaacson argues that da Vinci’s inventions could sometimes be practical means of filling a gap in what was on the market, but there were also strong influences (particularly anatomy) that left da Vinci full of questions, only to be solved by the development of some inventions to better understand concepts that were unknown to the scientific world. The reader will marvel at the extent to da Vinci’s innovative spirit, pushing the boundaries of what might be possible, all to help fill the void of his inquisitive nature. Not all of his inventions were meant to aid in artistic expression. There is surely a strong influence on the political happenings of the day—da Vinci had relationships with both the Borgia and Sforza families, vicious as they were—whereby war machines were devised. There is talk of tank-like structures and catapults to launch objects over palace walls, both ideas that would have been fostered by the bloody campaigns those two aforementioned families sought in their respective domains. The collection of drawings included in the biography permit the reader to marvel at the vast array of sketches and how da Vinci could have made a greater name for himself (as if he needed more notoriety). It is readily apparent that da Vinci’s innovative spirit was fuelled by a need to better understand the world around him, just as his art sought to open new means of expression at the dawn of the Renaissance. Well before his inventions could be formally created, da Vinci showed how his inquisitive nature was influenced by his thirst for knowledge, especially when he was parched and left to wonder about the inner workings of the human machine, the body! Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects that recurs throughout the biography is da Vinci’s love of all things anatomical. From the veins in the hands to the inner workings of a foetus and the valves of the heart, da Vinci was keen to dissect bodies to better understand the inner workings of various organs and systems. During a time when the Church was still wavering on the dissection of humans, da Vinci sought to open his horizons by exploring the inner workings of various animals, when human cadavers were not available. The desire to better comprehend the human body fuelled da Vinci’s desire to posit about the workings of organs and systems, at a time when nothing could be done ‘live’ or with the body still functioning. Isaacson explores da Vinci’s desire to better understand heart valves and the movement of blood, simply because he could not wrap his head around what might be going on. While he could devise a few experiments and reconstructed the heart, it was only in the 1960s that much of what da Vinci predicted could be proven entirely correct. Not only did da Vinci seek to explore the anatomy of the human body, he felt it essential to depict it in sketches from all angles. Without the ability to properly store the cadavers, da Vinci had only a short time to properly sketch the anatomical subjects. Some of these anatomy explorations surely led to inventions that made their way into da Vinci’s journals and also permitted some of the intricate detail found in numerous pieces of art, namely one of his most popular, the Vitruvian Man, where da Vinci showed extensive understanding of length proportions of the ‘perfect’ subject. Isaacson explores this in detail during part of the biography and may be of significant interest to the reader. Surely his biological curiosities made da Vinci’s creations better and provided the viewer with a better understanding of the realism the artist sought in his work. It is baffling not to look at all three aspects of Leonardo da Vinci now that I have taken the time to explore them, and see just how imbued his art and innovations were with all three perspectives. I would be remiss if I did not discuss the presentation of the biography and place Isaacson under the literary microscope. The thorough presentation of Leonardo da Vinci’s life helped create a better understanding of the man and his numerous endeavours. I will admit that I am not a major fan of art, nor do I pretend to understand the intricacies of paintings (gasp or toss the odd rotten tomato now). That being said, after reading this and viewing the countless images that Isaacson included in the book, I have a better understanding of the nuances that certain artists use, as well as the symbolism inherent for the viewer to better communicate with the artist. Isaacson takes the time to explain many of da Vinci’s influences, as well as fleshing out some of the symbols that da Vinci uses in his work. Referencing not only da Vinci’s work, but also scholarly references and fellow biographers, Isaacson provides a thorough narrative for the reader to better understand the man and some of his thinking. Adding the images to the book permits the reader to see, first hand, some of the sketches that da Vinci created at different times in his life, even if it creates an Olympic event to toggle between text and image (only made more difficult for those who used the audio version, such as myself). When referencing his various creations, having a visual compendium helps the reader to match something up with the narrative and brings the story to life in a new dimension. This enriches the experience and permits the reader to feel an active part of the process as the layers of da Vinci’s life become more apparent to the attentive reader. While some chapters are long, they ought not be daunting, as the narrative flows so well and the storytelling is second to none. Isaacson has spent as much time here as he did with some of his other key biographical pieces, all of which should be considered by the reader whose curiosity is not sated with this piece. And... as for that woodpecker question I posed to start this review, there’s a nugget of interest that da Vinci never fully explored, but Isaacson offers up. Kudos, Mr. Isaacson, for helping pave the way towards a better understanding of this key historical figure. You bring Leonardo da Vinci to life and help the reader want to know more, which is essential in a biographical piece. Love/hate the review?

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"As the writer says in the final chapter LEARNING FROM LEONARDO Seek knowledge for its own sake. Not all knowledge needs to be useful. Sometimes it should be pursued for pure pleasure. Such was the reading of this book to me. This book introduced me to a man from a long ago time who was thirsty enough for knowledge and information that he valiantly erased all the lines between reality and fantasy, broke all the rules separating science and arts and even made use of the illegitimacy of his own existence! Before knowing about him, I thought I may be inspired by him but now WOW, OH WOW, I am so unable to start expressing my feelings. And the credit definitely goes to the author for bringing every single detail of Leonardo's life to light taking into consideration his illegitimate birth, the divide between parents, upbringing, the environmental, economical, social and cultural conditions of places he lived in, the works of other great minds (friends/competitors/inspirations) existing during and before his time and how they charged his mind, the financial situations behind his works (complete/incomplete), his company (lovers/friends/teachers) and vast majority of subjects and fields Leonardo was interested in, the author has, without any doubt, performed a huge feat demanding applause, by giving notes on what the subject might or might not have felt while performing various acts of observation and experimentation!! The only thing that made Leonardo what he was were the never-ending questions his mind threw at him and its curiosity to know the answers to why, what and how of anything and everything he encountered. The delicate detail with which the author has handled and expressed this Renaissance man's brain and its working is amazing! A few words from Leonardo's writings I found moving and totally agree with; One of the things I liked about this book is that the author has provided pictures with every minute detail that could have ever thought about, every reasoning that existed either controversial or not and every fact lost as well as established about the works mentioned! Another brainstorming feature I liked is that the author has placed dates and times from other people's manuals who were involved with Leonardo during his personal and professional achievements as well has also tried to explain the effects of certain events and people on the great works of Leonardo! Alongside this, the author has made research, read books & papers and quoted other biographers (new/old) to charge up arguments regarding various aspects of the great masters' works! It states in the book that Leonardo rarely wrote about his own emotions so it is hard to know what he felt. Here, the author has well taken care to define the personal and professional levels of da Vinci's life to their very core so that we may be able to grasp the depth of his mind and heart through his achievements! __Isaacson __Isaacson No matter how many controversies they may relate to the name of , his works or the working of his mind, this book has made sure that I stay eternally inspired by a man like him! Thanks to the author. My 5 stars! A must must read! Highly recommended!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Walter Isaacson's biography of Leonardo da Vinci is a beautifully written tribute to this ultimate Renaissance man. The book is accessible for a general audience and contains over one hundred color figures of Leonardo's work. Always a fan of Leonardo, reading this biography has deepened my appreciation for him. I am completely blown away by all that he accomplished in art, science, and engineering. It's hard to believe that one person could accomplish so much in a single lifetime. Walter Isaacson's biography is a wonderful testament to the genius and creativity of one of the most gifted and influential people ever to walk this earth. Highly recommended."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This biography of Leonardo da Vinci offers a fresh look at the artist and scientist, who was distinguished by his curiosity, something we all can develop. Through passionate curiosity, careful observation and an imagination, we can all benefit, and that’s what propelled Leonardo to all his discoveries, not an academic knowledge, which he didn’t have. The first sentence of the first chapter had my attention right away. “Leonardo da Vinci had the good luck to be born out of wedlock.” Otherwise, the expectation for him would have been to become a notary. Leonardo was known for many projects and “he envisioned what innovators would invent centuries later.” My favorite of his projects has always been an ideal city. When Europe was ravaged by plaques, he recognized that it was due to poor sanitation. So he designed a city with two floors, with lower one hidden for canals, commerce, sanitation, and sewage. He was known for unfinished commissions, but as this biography points, he was continuously refining his paintings as he was gaining knowledge in anatomy. He “enjoyed the challenge of conception more than the chore of completion.” He always had a pen and paper with him to write down his observations in order not to miss anything. His mind was always as important to him as his body. He kept his mind busy and his body in good shape. He was a vegetarian most of his life, driven by his love for animals. This biography emphasizes Leonardo’s curiosity, which is beautifully explored, from bird-watching to observations of shape transformation in motion, and how that related to his work. A spellbinding story of one of the most extraordinary human beings, who is no longer seen as one who was known for unfinished projects, but rather as a self-taught man who cared about the process more than just finishing an assignment. “Be curious, relentlessly curious.” “Being relentlessly and randomly curious about everything around us is something that each of us can push ourselves to do, every working hour, just as he did.”"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The audiobook is a fantastic production. It is in this manner non-fiction audiobooks should be made. You are given a huge PDF file with 144 pictures, a character list and a timeline. To get the most out of the audiobook one should sit by a computer and look at the pictures as one listens; the audiobook follows the pictures one by one in the order they are presented, each picture being referred to in the text. Each is minutely analyzed and discussed. A listener is given stating to look and what you will there observe. I did see exactly what I was told I would see, most of the time. You could say that rather than listening you are looking at a flow of pictures while someone is giving you a well thought out guided tour of Leonardo da Vinci’s artworks, his notebooks and models of his imaginative creations. and the are of course shown. While I have seen both in reality, the first in the Louvre and the second in Milan, I saw them more clearly here in this book! There are pictures of Leonardo’s death-bed with his final patron King Francis supporting him, pictures of Michelangelo’s statues and paintings enabling the listener to make comparisons of the artists’ divergent techniques and pictures of Leonardo’s closest companions. You see some pictures up close and others at a distance giving you the most advantageous perspective. The pictures are of high quality and can be magnified, making it possible to focus in on a detail. The notebooks are mirrored; Leonardo being left-handed, wrote from right to left. I actually believe that the audio version may in fact be better than the written book in that you can magnify the pictures and you can listen while you look! Alfred Molina reads the audiobook clearly and at an appropriate tempo. I cannot judge the Italian accent, not knowing Italian myself. If Italian names are not your forte, the accompanying PDF list of main characters is very helpful. I found the narration very good and so have given the performance four stars. What about the book’s content? Is it balanced, revealing Leonardo’s weaknesses as well as his talents? Are sources referenced? Are opposing views voiced and a convincing resolution to the disputes drawn? Yes, yes and yes. . It is not long; it does not go off on lengthy tangents detailing history, state and religious conflicts, description of cities (Florence, Milan and Rome) nor famous people (such as other artists, several of the Medicis, Machiavelli, the Popes of the late 15th and early 16th centuries and of course Savonarola). The information is at times repetitive, this being done most often to emphasize a point. A basic understanding of the history of the early Renaissance will make the book more interesting, but is not a prerequisite. First and foremost, the author wants to make clear Leonardo’s ability to see the world as a whole. His knowledge was multidisciplinary. He excelled in not one field but in many – art, engineering, optics, anatomy, architecture, urban planning and more. He drew analogies from one field of thought to another. His curiosity was boundless. Did I get to know the man, by that I mean his personality, his sexual proclivities and desires, his dreams and his shortcomings? Yes. Some of his projects failed totally, and often he did not finish what he had begun. One could debate if that is a fault or a strength. Perhaps by putting an artwork or a project aside he could later make improvements. Think the and his calculations concerning the comparative areas of a circle and a rectangle. His penchant for list-making is both wonderful and humorous. What shines out most is his curiosity, his imagination, his ability to observe, things you and I do not even notice, things right there before our eyes but to which we are blind. Have you looked at the speed of birds’ wings on the up versus the down swing? Or how water swirls or how what we see up close differs from what we see at a distance or from the side. From observations, he then devised experiments. He saw patterns and drew analogies linking disparate fields of science. To say he was ahead of his time is an understatement. The book moves forward chronologically. Not much is known about his earliest years. The book begins with an introduction and ends with a conclusion, both of which in the audiobook are read by the author. His admiration for Leonardo is evident, but he remains clear-eyed too. The conclusion summarizes what we can learn from Leonardo’s life. What can he teach us? What can we do to make our own lives fuller and better? It’s a good conclusion, albeit a bit preachy. In the same vein, I will finish with these guidelines: *Be curious. *Open your eyes. Observe all that around you. *Appreciate nature. *Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. *Making to-do lists is good. These are not my guidelines but his. I like them."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is the third book that I have read of Walter Isaacson. The first one, Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, was fantastic. The second one, The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution was not as interesting to me. Now this book, about Leonardo da Vinci again brought me to a high level of enjoyment. I learned so much about Leonardo, he was such a fascinating man, one of the true Renaissance men. Leonardo was truly one-of-a-kind. He had a truly scientific outlook, fueled by his insatiable curiosity. His powers of observation were incredible. Just as an example, he was able to observe that the front wings of a dragonfly beat in the opposite direction from the rear wings. How could he see that? His scientific mind was continuously trying to learn new things, and he left thousands of pages of manuscripts and notes for us, today. But he did not publish; he did not see science as something to disseminate to others; he only pursued it for his own sake, to fill his thirst for knowledge and understanding. Leonardo was also a great artist. He saw painting as the highest form of art. And his papers became truly outstanding when he married his remarkable art skills with science. His drawings of human anatomy, as well as a myriad of other subjects, were his expression of beautiful art portraying his scientific observations. Where Leonardo especially excelled, was in his understanding of fluid dynamics, and his realistic art portrayals of fluid flow. I had not realized that Leonardo spent a good part of a year in the company of Cesare Borgia and Machiavelli. Borgia was an inhumanly cruel and treacherous politician who hired Leonardo to devise military weapons against his enemies. Machiavelli admired Borgia, yet actually left him earlier than did Leonardo, perhaps out of disgust for his cruelty. Leonardo seemed all too happy to comply with Borgia's wishes, as he thought of himself, first and foremost, as an inventor of military innovations. I highly recommend this book. Walter Isaacson illuminates the life and accomplishments of Leonardo. While Leonardo did have a few foibles, Isaacson shows how he excelled in so many aspects of life, and gains an understanding of his motivations, ambitions, and passions. I listened to the audiobook edition of this book, narrated by Alfred Molina. He does an excellent reading of the book, and helped make this a very enjoyable experience."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book provides an in-depth analysis of Da Vinci's life and works. Have always been interested in the Master, though my interests revolved around his magnificent painting. Thanks to this book I have learnt a lot about everything he was interested in. The books is well-written and the language rather easy to follow, some general knowledge regarding science required at times, though. I have thoroughly enjoyed this massive reading, and was especially drawn by the mystery behind one of the painting, La Princpessa. Da Vinci was one of the real geniuses who tried to understand the world and help others understand it."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""Леонардо да Винчи"" - биография от Уолтър Айзаксън (ревю на български след текста на английски) One of the best books I read in 2018 was a biography. Not to anyone but to Leonardo da Vinci - a historical figure that I'm sure almost every normal person associates with a genius. Actually after reading the biography written by Isaacson, I was left with the impression that Leonardo was not a genius. He was the most ordinary person in the world who only happened to ask a lot of questions about things around him in times when people were afraid to do so. His whole life path, all his knowledge, his whole contribution to art and science is due not to a rare genius of his DNA but to his curiosity that was stronger than the fear of the unknown. There is no dramatization in this book - a trend that was kind of annoyingly present in the latest biography books I had read. As you read you can rely on 100% facts with minimal speculation and dramatization. Sources of information are mostly Leonardo's notebooks, many of which are stored in the Windsor Royal Collection and to which Isaacson had access while working on the biography. I found the artistic moments of Leonardo's life very interesting and leading in the biography. Painting such as the Lady with Hermeline, John the Baptist, The Last Supper, St. Anna with the Madonna, the Savior of the World, etc. The information was very rich, interesting and, last but not least, useful. Useful because it seems to arm the eye of the reader with knowledge - knowledge by which to see the merits in his paintings that have made him an innovator and one of the greatest and influential artists of the Italian Renaissance. Supporting moments in the biography were his scientific discoveries - the periods in which he studied topics such as optics, anatomy, hydropower, space, and so on. They have not succumbed to Leonardo's artistic activity, but on the contrary - they have outgun his artistic dedication. What really impressed me is the art he created, combining knowledge from all these disciplines. I'm not a man of art, and that's why I find it a great deal that a book made me understand art in a new way and look differently on Renaissance paintings. --- Една от най-хубавите книги, които съм прочел през 2018 г. се оказа биография. Не на кого да е, а на Леонардо да Винчи - историческа личност, която съм сигурен, че почти всеки нормален човек свързва с някакъв гений. Всъщност след прочита на биографията, написана от Айзъксън, останах с впечатлението, че Леонардо не е бил гений. Бил е най-обикновен човек, който си е задавал въпроси за нещата около него. Целият му житейски път, цялото знание, целият му принос към изкуството и към науката се дължи не на рядък гениален участък от ДНК-то му, а заради любопитството му, което е било по-силно от страха от неизвестното. В книгата няма драматизация - тренд, който ми правеше впечатление в последните биографични книги, които бях чел. Т.е. можете да разчитате на 100% факти, с минимум спекулация и драматизация. Източници на информация са предимно тетрадките на Леонардо, голяма част от които се съхраняват в Кралската колекция в Уиндзър и до които Айзъксън е имал достъп, докато е работил по книгата. Намерих за изключително интересни и водещи в биографията артистичните моменти от живота на Леонардо. Нарисуването на картини като Дамата с хермелина, Йоан Кръстител, Последната вечеря, Света Анна с Мадоната, Спасителят на света и т.н. Информацията беше много богата, интересно поднесена и не на последно място - полезна. Полезна, защото сякаш въоръжава окото на читателя със знания - знания, с които сам да види достойнствата в картините му, които са го превърнали в новатор и един от най-големите и влиятелни артисти на Италианския Ренесанс. Като поддържащи моменти бяха описани научните му изследвания и открития - периодите, в които е изследвал теми като оптиката, анатомията, хидроинженерството, космоса и т.н. Те не са отстъпвали пред артистичната дейност на Леонардо, даже напротив - май са я превъзхождали като отдаденост. Но това, което истински ме впечатли е изкуството, което е сътворил, съчетавайки знания от всички тези дисциплини. Аз не съм човек на изкуството, и точно затова намирам за голяма работа, че една книга ме накара да разбера по нов начин и да гледам различно на Ренесансовите картини. Смятам, че това e много ценна книга, която трябва да присъства във всяка една библиотека. А ако не знаете нищо за Леонардо, освен имената на най-известните му картини - то задължително трябва да я прочетете. Няма шанс да не ви хареса."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I suppose everyone is familiar with DaVinci’s most famous painting, the Mona Lisa. It might just be the most famous painting of all time, by anyone. I once queued up to see it in person, only to discover that I could only view it under the arms of and between the heads of a throng of people who’d beaten me to it. I recall being surprised at how small and how dark it was. I also enjoyed Dan Brown’s conspiracy theory regarding his painting of the in his novel The Da Vinci Code, a theory comprehensively debunked in this book. I’d even come across his depiction of even though I didn’t fully appreciate it’s genesis or significance. So in my mind the great man’s ability to draw and paint was not in doubt, but what of his other gifts? I was less sure of these. I’d enjoyed the author’s biography of Steve Jobs, a man who he’d spent countless hours with and had also been afforded the opportunity to talk to many of his colleagues and acquaintances. I’d found that Isaacson was able to really bring Jobs to life on the page, but what of a man who’d lived over five hundred years ago, how much could he, could anyone, really know about this man? Well, it turns out that Da Vinci was an incessant note taker, carrying a notebook with him at all times and forever scribbling thoughts, drawing pictures and making ‘to do’ lists. Moreover, over seven thousand pages of these notes still exist to this day! To put this in context, the author points out that this is greater in volume than the total number of emails he and Steve Jobs were able to retrieve to aid the writing of his bio. Born in 1452, from the start there were a number of things that might have be considered obstructions to his long-term success: he was left-handed, gay, did not receive full formal schooling and had been born illegitimately. What he did have going for him, however, was imagination, perseverance, undying inquisitiveness and startling observational skills. His interests ranged from art to mechanics, mathematics (though he was never to become wholly proficient in this subject), the human body and nature in all its forms. His stance throughout life was not to accept received wisdom but rather to conduct experimentation and observation and then draw his own conclusions. And subsequent study of his notes shows that he had formulated theories and made hugely significant discoveries that were to remain hidden for a hundred years or more as he sadly failed to publish his work. Many of these discoveries were later to be attributed to others who devised their own theories independently many, many years later. It seems that though he’s best known as a painter he became a reluctant participant in this art as years passed. In fact, there are reportedly only around fifteen paintings have been fully, or mainly, attributed to him. He was a perfectionist who continually worked and re-worked his most famous pieces. His practice was to overlay diluted paint, building up layers until he achieved the desired effect. In fact, he worked on the for sixteen years and had still not delivered the final version of the painting at the time of his death. His knowledge of optics was way ahead of its time and this meant that he could create effects that were simply not achievable by other artists. Isaacson’s book is exhaustive in detail and at times exhausting to plough through. I listened to an audio version that ran to over seventeen hours in length and was accompanied by a very informative pdf document of one hundred and eleven pages. The combination of the two actually worked very well and I certainly didn’t feel cheated by not having a full colour hard copy to read through. It’s a comprehensive and thoroughly researched piece of work and though it does lack a little of the closeness to the man embodied in the Jobs book I do feel that I was able to gain a real feeling for Da Vinci and felt a genuine sense of sadness as this account of his life drew to a close."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Before reading this biography my perception of Leonardo da Vinci was of the bearded genius behind a handful of remarkable paintings, and endless pages of drawings devoted to either anatomy or futuristic but impracticable machines. The challenge for Isaacson was to coax the man from behind the work. Five centuries of time and a paucity of sources beyond the work itself, presented the author with considerable difficulties. In spite of these, this book largely succeeds in revealing Leonardo as a charming and well-liked polymath who was also deeply frustrating. The frustration stems from all the paradoxes of the man, and the thought of what he might have achieved. He was endlessly hard working, yet only completed a dozen paintings. He was considered to be an expert architect, who built almost nothing. A far-sighted inventor who constructed none of his gadgets. A gifted scientist who published no findings. A vegetarian disector of animals. A person with extraordinary gifts, who devoted much of his energy to organising pageants to keep idle Milanese courtiers amused. This is a fascinating and well-researched biography. Isaacson does, on occasion, fall prey to the biographer's sin of idiolising his subject, but in the case of Leonardo da Vinci this can be forgiven."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“he never finished any of the works he began because, so sublime was his idea of art, he saw faults even in the things that to others seemed miracles.” ― Walter Isaacson, Leonardo da Vinci This was an interesting biography, and an interesting approach, but it just wasn't great. Isaacson is one of those former editors of large, popular news magazines who can seemingly throw out a biography every couple years. He loves writing about transformative geniuses and polymaths, thus his books on: , , , and [?]. Obviously, from any perspective, Leonardo da Vinci (the first among Renaissance Men) belongs on this list. I even liked Isaacson's approach of using Leonardo's notebooks as the backbone of this book. Or at least that was how Isaacson presented this book. Isaacson, however, kept drifting back to a soft narrative storytelling that comes naturally to him. It made the book, however, a bit uneven and choppy. The notebooks, with their art, doodles, ramblings, and jumps, are hard to translate into a Costco-selling bestseller. To be fair to Isaacson, I did just finish, last year, Caro's four (so far) volume series on LBJ. So, it is unlikely ANY biographer would get more than 4-stars after Caro. But still, I was hoping for a bit more from Isaacson."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Walter Isaacson never makes Leonardo out to be anymore more than a human being. He points out that art history can often descend into hagiography, especially when it comes to its greatest minds. Both Vasari and Kenneth Clark placed Leonardo on a god-like pedestal, untouched by any other human in history and in possession of a truly divine mind. Isaacson does his best to refute this. He paints Leonardo as almost painfully human, as a man who rarely finished any of the jobs he began and whose attention and interests fluctuated like the waves. Most of us know Leonardo first and foremost as a great artist. However, we are all also aware of his notebooks, filled to the margins with meditations on geometry, mathematics, anatomical studies, studies of hydraulics and numerous to-do lists. If you want a book solely on Leonardo's artistic endeavours then this book is for you. Isaacson has numerous chapters on every facet of Leonardo's studies. Which means that you will often find yourself deep in a chapter about studies of the flow of water or efforts to square the circle. Interdisciplinarity was something of Leonardo's forte, melding art and science together in his notebooks and canvases, and Isaacson reflects this in his biography, creating a book which covers a vast amount of topics. Having a degree in art history, I was interested to see how Isaacson would tackle Leonardo. I am very familiar with most of the accounts that Isaacson relies upon, especially Vasari's short, fanciful biography. I found Isaacson to be more than competent when writing about art. I think he keeps it to the basics though, discussing only the most surface analyses of each work, which was probably more an editing issue rather than the fault of the author. Also by not having a background in art history, Isaacson avoids writing in 'international art English' or 'Artspeak' as those of us in the field call it. Basically it is the incomprehensible form of English that many art historians write in which is just drenched in metaphor and imagery and is completely inaccessible to the common reader. Therefore it was actually quite refreshing to read about Leonardo's works in a language resembling English. However, Isaacson is not afraid to put his opinion across on the meanings on some of Leonardo's most complex mysteries. I suppose he's allowed to be impartial, it is his book, but it does come across as somewhat jarring when the author suddenly jumps from the role as narrator and then begins to give his opinions on topics. Another fault of Isaacson's prose is his repetition of facts. He doesn't use a linear timeline for this biography, instead going topic-by-topic. Therefore, in his jumping around of the timeline he often states things that he has stated before, and events that we have already discussed. It doesn't happen often enough to constitute as bad editing, but it does happen often enough for me to notice. Overall I found this to be an expansive and well-researched biography of one of the Renaissance's greatest minds. Some may take offence at Isaacson's portrait of Leonardo, which shows him not as a god but as a flawed human being. I found this quite refreshing, personally. It made Leonardo almost seem relatable when we hear about his Olympic-level procrastination and his lifelong inability to actually finish projects. Isaacson has done an amazing job of humanising Leonardo and that is the book's greatest achievement."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"If you like a little psychology with your history, this is a book for you! It gives you a wonderful insight into the mind of one of the most fascinating men in human history. Da Vinci was quite the character. A bit enigmatic and mercurial. It was a delight learning more about his personality through this book."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"When most people hear the phrase “Renaissance Man,” they immediately picture me in hose and doublet, speaking in iambic pentameter or singing lustily whilst expounding on the physical properties of precious metals as I gnaw on a turkey leg at a local festival. While that is, in fact, the proper image to bring to mind, there are a few individuals out there, less culturally astute than the general populace, perhaps, who might think of Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo drew curly hair better than anyone in history. He was also pretty okay at being a painter, polymath, engineer, and scientist of the first order. And so, I suppose, we can reasonably dub him, too, a “Renaissance Man,” even if he can’t enthusiastically butcher a good Bon Jovi song the way I can. Isaacson offers his usual mix of deep scholarship and eminent readability, just as he does in works that include , , and (all of which, incidentally, I highly recommend). Here, however, he also displays an acute eye for art criticism, albeit at such great length that you might sometimes wish his eyes were, perhaps, a bit less acute because it is, in fact, possible to overanalyze the left-handed hatching within the third button of a gentleman’s coat such that you attribute entirely too much metaphorical meaning to it. (Relax, art history pedants—I realize there are probably no Leonardo paintings that feature just such a button; it was an example of the kind of extreme behavior that I’m sure you would appreciate despite having no earthly idea how annoying such pedantry is.) (And shut up—I’m not anything like those people. I do NOT correct people’s grammar in the same way. I just do it silently under my breath. They only hear me like half the time.) What Isaacson excels in chronicling, however, and what makes Leonardo such a fascinating subject—and likely will make him one in perpetuity—is his boundless curiosity. We remember Leonardo as one of the greatest painters of all time, sure, as well as an architect, engineer, scientist, and anatomist of uncommon aptitude. But above even all of those attributes, the combination of which arguably makes Leonardo the greatest thinker in chronicled history*, he appears to have been the most insatiably, relentlessly, and obsessively curious human that ever existed. It was impossible for Leonardo to see an animal and not want to know how it did something, a machine without wanting to know how it worked, or a person without wanting to know what they looked like if you flayed them and looked directly at their muscles and organs (okay, sometimes the curiosity thing got a little creepy). I mean, who else makes a note in their journal to remind themselves to “Describe the tongue of a woodpecker”? (I mean, other than someone interested in becoming intimate with Woody Woodpecker, and I’m totally not judging you if that’s you.) That curiosity, combined with a relentless commitment to, and patience for, observation led Leonardo to become not only a legend in his own day, but to sketch out and lay the groundwork for discoveries and inventions that would take decades if not centuries to be confirmed or brought into being, making him a legend for all time. The fact that he did all of this despite little formal education makes it all the more remarkable, though that same lack of formal schooling drove him, in part because he relied on observation and testing hypotheses before declaring something to be so rather than relying on imperfect—or patently absurd—wisdom from classical thinkers. If there’s a knock on Leonardo, it’s that he often conceived of grandiose projects that he didn’t finish, either because he lost interest or realized he couldn’t complete them to the level of perfection he demanded of himself. But, Isaacson’s account makes clear that one of the primary reasons—really, THE primary reason—he didn’t always finish what he started is because he became so intensely curious about something else that he couldn’t help but move on to the next thing. It was compulsive, and it’s a characteristic that undoubtedly denied the world at least a few additional masterpieces. But, curiosity is also what made Leonardo the impossibly gifted cross-functional thinker whose legend has endured for 500 years and seems a safe bet to continue on for at least that much longer. I highly recommend this book for anyone who’s—wait for it—curious about Leonardo, the Renaissance, or how a brilliant mind works. And, I promise you that, when you’re done, you’ll start taking greater note of what’s happening in the world around you."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is an engrossing, well-paced biography that is a pleasure to read. I'm left with a deep and motivating admiration of many facets of Leonardo's character, especially his eager mind, attention to detail, thinking from first principles, his use extensive use of physical notebooks, and, most intriguingly, his use of art as a thinking tool. It's fascinating to get a glimpse of someone so far ahead of his time, and it's fun to think about what he would make of today."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Hard to imagine a more definitive summation of Leonardo da Vinci's legacy and personality. I do think 'summation' is the right word, however. The biographer arranges details in logical order but offers little professional assessment. What commentary he does provide is quite generic and not necessarily the voice of someone truly invested in his subject. There's a cringe-worthy self-help guide at the end where readers are meant to gain valuable lessons from the life of da Vinci. I don't disagree with the concluding thoughts, but they do come across as hokey (and unnecessary) after 600 pages. The art critic sections are a highlight, but these too feel like the vaguely plagiarized assessments of others, not something the biographer has strong opinions about. Perhaps there is an issue of lacking vocabulary for clear articulation. The sweeping pages on the Mona Lisa, for example, have an ability to sound profound but in actuality say nothing at all. It's also exceedingly rare for Isaacson to disagree with established thought. At no point did I feel like I had to read account of da Vinci. Usually I was wondering if there were other books I should have read instead. Isaacson does an excellent job on the autopsy sections. He delivers satisfying images of a Renaissance dandy joyfully chopping up corpses in bloodstained cellars for the sake of research. Though these passages make up a fairly small portion of the book, they are exceptionally well-drawn. Overall, this is my first time reading a Walter Isaacson biography, but I get the sense he wrote this book because he is a professional biographer and Leonardo da Vinci is a popular subject, not because of any deep personal connection. There's no shortage of books on da Vinci and I suspect another one out there is better. Send me your recommendations!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""What made Leonardo a genius, what set him apart from people who were extraordinarily smart, was creativity, the ability to apply imagination to intellect. His facility for combining observation with fantasy allowed him, like other creative geniuses, to make unexpected leaps that related things seen to things unseen. ""Talent hits a target that no one else can hit,"" wrote the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. ""Genius hits a target no one else can see."" (518) ""Be open to mystery. Not everything needs sharp lines."" (524) What makes Leonardo da Vinci such an enigmatic figure in history also lends to his appeal, and no better contemporary writer would be capable of chronicling his life than Walter Isaacson. The book is such a celebration of Leonardo's talent, but also of his important place in history, his unquenchable curiosity about the world around him, and the continuing impact he has in modern times. The amount of dedication Isaacson spent on this book is very appreciated, as each glossy page provides important commentary and backstory into Da Vinci and the places, people, and ideas that incapsulated the Italian renaissance. Beautiful coloured pictures are present that showcase Leonardo's paintings, anatomical and engineering sketches, concept drawings and footnotes. It's quite a heavy tome. Isaacson explores Da Vinci's nature of exploration, reasoning, and scientific fact, and playfully tunes into the persona of the man that feels entirely respectable to the matter at hand. Readers will of course learn about paintings such as the Mona Lisa, Last Supper, Lady with an Ermine, and sketches like the Vitruvian Man but also his association with rulers like French King Francis I or the tyrannical Cesare Borgia, his homosexuality and relationship with the young rascal Salaì, the complicated associations he had with is own family, and of course his own influence and discoveries made sometimes centuries before becoming fact. Sometimes the techniques and science behind each of Leonardo's trials and discoveries in his work become shrouded to the reader in a bit of a fog as Isaacson describes their technical aspects, but otherwise this is a superb book. Da Vinci was always a personification of the duality of passionate knowledge and a veil of mystery, but that's what makes him so special. Rating 4.5/5"

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have read two of Isaacson's previous biographies (Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein). I particularly liked the Steve Jobs biography since the author was able to effectively get under his subject's skin due to his unique access to the subject. In the case of Leonardo da Vinci, Isaacson was unsuccessful in my opinon of bringing Da Vinci to life probably due to a lack of primary source material on the subject. That is always the bugbear of writing biographies of subjects from so long ago. In this book, Isaacson seems to try to compensate for the lack of materials by writing an art history book which is so focused on the artist's work that the story of the man himself (of what little can be known) is obscured by distracting and overly glowing details -- that is, it felt extremely padded. Noting the other reviews of this book placed on GoodReads, I think what is happening is that Isaacson is so well-respected (deservedly so) that readers are biased in his favor based on his previous works and cannot look at the current work in a balanced way. I rated it two stars since I didn't, on the whole, dislike the book and there are interesting parts to it, but it definitely does not stand up to his prior works."

First, if you listen to the audio version as I did, you REALLY need to have a copy of the accompanying PDF (which I didn't because I listen in my car). The author gets into such detail with regard to Da Vinci's paintings and drawings, that it's difficult to follow along without having the reference material. Also, while exceptionally well written and researched, be prepared for a lengthy read - more than I generally am up for. I recently read a much shorter book on Da Vinci by Kathleen Krull (high school level) which I believe covered many if not most of the points raised by Isaacson."

's starting point for this biography was not his art masterpieces (, ) but rather his notebooks that he left and which survive to this day. They contain sketches and doodles, mathematics, anatomy, and to do lists. If da Vinci were alive today he would probably diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and be prescribed medication. There was no one subject that could contain his interest or curiosity. Often times he left one project unfinished and moved on to something else. He was a man of science and art and his passions ranged from anatomy, the heart, engineering, flying machines, weaponry, geology, fossils, ... In fact it seemed that there was nothing that did not interest him. He was illegitimate and homosexual but at ease. It is probably fortuitous that he was born out of wedlock otherwise he would have been expected to become a notary like first born legitimate sons in his family stretching back five generations. Children have a natural curiosity and are unafraid to ask questions. . After a few years that curiosity seems to lessen as do the questions. With da Vinci this never seemed to happen. Thankfully. The world would be poorer without the gifts this genius left us. A lengthy and beautifully illustrated book. It is not a page turner. It should be savored and at times go back and reread parts."

I'm not sure why I was compelled to read this 550+ page book about Leonardo Da Vinci specifically, but I'm glad I did! I found it so interesting. This is probably more aimed toward those who know little about da Vinci (like me) so it suited me well. It goes through Leonardo's life from bith to death in chronological order, with longer chapters focussing on his greater works like Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Some of the chapters seemed to jump around a bit, and there were a few things that were repeated a few times until it felt redundant, but I still think this was overall such a fascinating book. I had to stop multiple times to tell people some random Leonardo fact because I was so interested and had to share.

It turns out that I knew very little about the amazing Leonardo da Vinci. Obviously one knows about the famous painting, the Mona Lisa, which I have glimpsed in the Louvre through a bobbing throng of heads. But I didn't know, for example, that Leonardo worked on the painting for decades, carried it around with him, and still had it with him when he died. I won't list here all the things I didn't know or I fear this review would be vastly long. """" Leonardo was insatiably curious, and incredibly observant. Many of his projects —indeed most of them— were never completed. His notebooks, thousands of pages, are still being studied. Leonardo did not get along with his slightly younger contemporary Michelangelo — did you know that? Leonardo was known for collaborating and developed working relationships with other artists and engineers, but there was some tension with Michelangelo and they tended to avoid each other. Leonardo was fond of pageants and festivals. He helped design and stage manage these spectacles, and some of the fanciful drawings in his notebooks are thought to depict a theatrical device, rather than, for example, an actual flying machine. So much to learn about Leonardo!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I love Walter Isaacsons biographies, they are always engaging, never dry, and I learn so much while being thoroughly entertained because it reads more like a novel many times rather than a dry non-fiction feel to it. Leonardo is obviously one of the most world renown artists ever born, but there’s so much I didn’t know about him. What I loved most was learning about his personality, which I knew nothing about. Sometimes when learning about one of histories greats you sort of cringe because they were actually assholes or power hungry or just unpalatable in some way. Leonardo was apparently charming to be around, a warm funny person that most people found engaging and entertaining. He often times impressed the courts or nobles with his antics, drawing things in front of a live audience, using his drawings to tell tales or make points. He was a big animal advocate and was vegetarian for most of his adult life. Sometimes he would go to gatherings or parties and speak poetically about a mother who’s lost her daughter, only to have her throat slit and then eaten. It sounded like a barbarian raided a town, but at the end he would reveal the poem was about a goat or a sheep. He was one of the first to surmise that animals experience pain too, there was a widely held myth that animals didn’t have the same sense of pain that humans do. But, Leonardo theorized correctly that anything that moves would be able to sense pain, in case that movement caused damage. The biography follows Leonardo from birth to death and everything in between. He was born a bastard to a well to do notary which actually wasn’t as big of a deal as you may think. In Florence during his lifetime bastards weren’t uncommon, and they weren’t necessarily shunned out of existence either and were often times embraced and legitimized. Leonardo had no intention of becoming a notary, but his experience growing up as the son of a notary was influential throughout his life – he took fastidious notes on basically everything he observed from bird flight to the size and shapes of rocks to facial expressions. He had volumes and volumes of notebooks and sketches, many of which have been preserved through time and give us amazing glimpses into his thought processes. Leonardo had a really bad habit of not finishing his work, there are thousands of half finished essays, paintings, and designs. He had amazing ideas but often lacked the follow through to make them presentable or functional. But, when he did finish something they almost always became masterpieces. He once worked as a military engineer trying to design weapons of war, and many of them were truly monstrous. Luckily for humanity, his weapons never came to fruition and weren’t used in war. Unfortunately, his design for a perfectly laid out city complete with sewage removal was ignored as well, and had the powers that be paid attention and used his designs, many instances of plague and disease could have been avoided. I did not know going into this that Leonardo was gay and openly gay at that. He was charged twice with sodomy, but thankfully nothing came of that. He wrote many pieces on how he found the idea of copulating with a woman to be abhorrent and had many sketches of his male lovers. One of which caught his eye and held his attention for many years, Salai. Salai showed up as a model for many, many paintings and sketches, and his likeness was used countless times. Overall, this was an amazing biography and I can’t wait to see what Isaacson does next."

I have also traveled to Italy several times to see the art & architecture in person. I was looking forward to treating this book as a refresher course. Alas, it was not to be. I'm not sure the author really knew what he wanted this book to be. The vacuous, self-help prattle is absolutely unnecessary. I suspect the publisher came up with this angle to try to make the book more ""relevant"" to modern readers. For those who are really interested in Leonardo, I think it's fair to say this aspect could have been left to the reader's imagination. Several chapters in, it also became clear that historians still don't know that much about Leonardo personally. Early in the book, the author dismisses a biography of Leonardo by contemporary Giorgio Vasari as exaggerated and romanticized, but later in this book quotes Vasari in much the same tone to try to flesh out the subject and fill space. Much of the book is an attempt at art history. But the author isn't really qualified to render his own judgments. He frequently quotes true experts whose works we should probably read instead. It was not long before I felt this book was a maddening waste of time. ------------- I have not read the author's books on Benjamin Franklin or Einstein, but can say he really missed the mark with his Steve Jobs biography."

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I’ve spent a lot of time reading about the lives of everyday people in medieval and ancient times. It’s something I find fascinating — trying to climb into their heads and see how they saw the world. But it’s tricky. Most of what we know about these eras comes from the pens of kings, monks, and magistrates, and that gives us a terribly skewed perspective. The voices of everyday people are usually missing, and it makes it hard to fully grasp what life was really like for the majority. That being said, I thought this book might offer a bit of that insight, given how personal the book is. Leonardo left behind so many detailed journals and sketches that you’d think it would be like stepping right into his shoes. And to an extent, it was. But still, I found myself struggling with this book in the same way I’ve struggled with other historical biographies. It’s hard to really connect with someone from such a different time and world, even when they’re as famous and well-documented as Leonardo. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot to like about the book. Isaacson does a great job of peeling back the layers of Leonardo’s genius and explaining not only his artistic brilliance but also his scientific and engineering insights. There’s a sense of awe that comes with reading about how Leonardo’s mind worked — the way he could so easily switch between dissecting a human heart and designing a flying machine. The man’s curiosity was boundless, and Isaacson conveys that well. If you’re looking to learn about how one of the most famous minds in history ticked, you won’t be disappointed. But, for me, I think the problem lay in the gap between Leonardo’s time and my own. Leonardo lived in a world that’s just so incredibly different from the one we live in today, and it’s tough to bridge that gap, no matter how intimate Isaacson tries to make the biography. Leonardo was such an outlier, even for his own time. His genius is almost alien, and the world he lived in — Renaissance Italy — feels distant and unfamiliar, despite the wealth of detail Isaacson provides. I think I walked away from this book with a lot of information about Leonardo but not much of a personal connection to him. That being said, one of the parts of the book I enjoyed the most was the attached PDF that includes Leonardo’s art and drawings. That really brought his work to life in a way the text alone didn’t quite manage. Seeing his sketches, his designs for everything from military weapons to intricate anatomy studies, was like getting an art and engineering education all in one go. It’s amazing to think that one man could have done so much in his lifetime. I think Isaacson did a good job helping me to appreciate the sheer scope of Leonardo’s achievements, even if it’s hard to get inside his head completely. In the end, I think the book is a good choice if you’re looking to learn about Leonardo’s accomplishments and get a window into how a genius sees the world. But if you’re hoping to come away feeling like you’ve really “gotten to know” Leonardo as a person, you might be left feeling a bit like I did — fascinated, but still distant. And maybe that’s just the nature of reading history. We can try our hardest to understand the people of the past, but there’s always going to be that gap that’s hard to cross. Maybe that’s the price we pay for reading about people from such distant times. Still, I’m glad I read this book, if only for the education in both art and engineering that it gave me."

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I don’t have a lot to say about this [edit: coming back after my draft, I see I was mistaken], but in keeping with my New Year’s resolution to put down into words something about each book I read this year, here are my rambling thoughts. First off, I heeded Chrissie’s advice, ""To get the most out of the audiobook one should sit by a computer and look at the pictures as one listens."" well, partial advice anyway. As much as I love audiobooks, I did not want to have to be in front of the computer to view the pictures. So, I read the hardcover edition. The first thing I noticed was that it was the heaviest 600-page book I’ve ever seen. This is because the pages are of a fine, heavy, glossy stock. This was a wonderful decision by someone (I don’t know if it was the publisher or Isaacson himself) as it truly makes the artwork and drawings that are featured liberally throughout pop in beautiful color as each is discussed. It was a thorough biography of Leonardo’s life which is what I assume the author intended, but it didn’t rise to the level of “Wow” for me and I am struggling as to understand why. The thing that sticks most with me is Isaacson’s belief that if Leonardo where not a bastard, he would likely have been forced to follow in the family business of being a notary like his father and grandfather. Being illegitimate, he was thankfully freer to follow his own path—and what a path—what a polymath! I got the impression that painting was not his true love. His first love, probably, but not his true love. He seemed to prefer engineering and science, especially anatomy. He would dissect bodies and draw what he saw until he could no longer stand the smell. I can’t imagine. Of his personality, I learned that he was brilliant (obviously), a keen observer, flamboyant, a procrastinator, and a perfectionist. Sometimes he would stare a painting for hours and then make only a few brush strokes and call it a day. It was his observational skills that helped him understand perspective and that perspective that helped bring his paintings to life--well, also dissecting bodies to understand musculature. When people say you need to live life to its fullest, look to Leonardo. He certainly did not waste a day."

Words, such as ""wondrous,"" ""brilliant"", and ""ingenious"" should be used sparingly, even when discussing Leonardo da Vinci. Otherwise when something truly is wondrous, the reader will no longer care or believe."

It is organized according to the topics included in Leonardo’s notebooks. By studying these notebooks, the author gives readers an idea of his interests, curiosity, personality, thought processes, eccentricities, and keen eye for observations. Isaacson discusses the creation of da Vinci’s well-known drawings, sculptures, and paintings, such as his version of Vitruvian man, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, a handful of lesser-known works, and a few attributed to him much later. The text covers his commissions and creative methods. It chronicles his major contributions to science and engineering at a time when technology was rapidly advancing. It establishes the historic context of his accomplishments, as well as those of his contemporaries (Michelangelo, Machiavelli, the Medici family, the Borgias, etc.) Supplemental materials include figures and illustrations, referred to throughout the text, and the detailed notes are well worth reading. In addition to the works of art he is famous for, Leonardo dabbled in physics, architecture, mechanics, biology, botany, anatomy, mathematics, and much more. Many of his ideas were well ahead of his time. He was a perfectionist who left many works unfinished. The wide variety of da Vinci’s interests and knowledge is truly remarkable. I found it fascinating!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Fascinating portrait of da Vinci. I learned a ton from this, but my biggest takeaway was how insanely curious about EVERYTHING Leonardo was. He was a painter, but also viewed himself as a scientist and engineer. In his pursuits to understand human proportions he dissected hundreds of animals and humans, to learn about muscles and eyes and how everything works. He understood how the eye sees in the 3D hundreds of years before anyone else. But the craziest part - is he published none of it. He wasn't looking for fame or respect from peers. He put a lot of it in his notebooks, which Isaacson based this book off of - but he would literally go on year long tangents (eg to understand perpetual motion) - just because he was curious. To me, this speaks a lot about the power of curiosity. I had no idea that there are only 15 completed paintings attributable to him. He had a ton of unfinished projects, but this is also because he was a perfectionist and also a scientist. We all the know Mona Lisa - but I didn't know that he was commissioned to paint it, and spent 20 years trying to perfect it, up until his death, never delivering it to the person who had ordered it! Isaacson talks at one point about how he is fascinated with the intersection of unrelated disciplines, and that's what drew him to Steve Jobs and Apple, as he famously merged technology and design. Intersections can help you think differently, and Leonardo was impressive at this. And"

Leonardo was born to Caterina and Piero out of wedlock. Lived primarily with his grandparents and uncle Francesco in the family house in the heart of Vinci. Leonardo's only formal learning was at an abacus school, an elementary academy that emphasized on the math skills useful in commerce. He learnt how to draw analogies between cases, a method that was used repeatedly in his later science. Analogies and spotting patterns became for him a rudimentary method of theorizing. Leonardo was a homosexual and twice was accused of sodomy. Piero, Leonardo's father helped him get most of his commissions due to his position and contacts. His letter to Ludovico, the ruler of Milan, best regarded not as a reliable catalogue of his actual engineering accomplishments but instead as a glimpse into his hopes and ambitions. Only one of Leonardo's military conceptions is known to have made it off the pages of his notebooks and onto the battlefield and he arguably deserves priority as its inventor. The wheellock or wheel lock which he devised in the 1490s was a way to create a spark for igniting the gunpowder in a musket or similar hand-carried weapon. The only military project Leonardo actually delivered to Ludovico was a survey of the castle's defenses. Shortly after his arrival in Milan, Leonardo began his lifelong practice of keeping notebooks on a regular basis. His notebooks have been rightly called 'the most astonishing testament to the power of human observation and imagination ever set down on paper'. The joy of the juxtapositions is that they allow us to marvel at the beauty of a universal mind as it wanders exuberantly in free-range fashion over the arts and sciences and by doing so senses the connections in our cosmos. Leonardo's entrée into the court of Ludovico was as a producer of pageants. The interplay of fantasy and machinery was something he was born to choreograph. His musical pursuits earned him financial stipends and also launched him into more substantive paths: they laid the ground for his work on the science of percussion - how striking an object can product vibrations, waves and reverberations - and exploring the analogy between sound waves and water waves. Another contribution that Leonardo made of life at the Sforza court were little literary amusements which were also primarily intended to be read aloud or performed. There are at least three hundred of them in his notebooks in a variety of forms: fables, facetious tales, prophecies, pranks and riddles. Conceiving ideas was for Leonardo, as it has been throughout history for most other cross disciplinary thinkers a collaborative endeavor. As with so many things, empirical approach put Leonardo ahead of his time. He broke the tradition of basing his science primarily on observations, then discerning patterns and testing their validity through more observations and experiments. As a result, Leonardo became of the major Western thinkers more than a century before Galileo to pursue in a persistent hands on fashion the dialogue between experience and theory that would lead to the modern Scientific Revolution. Through his work on machinery Leonardo developed a mechanistic view of the world foreshadowing that of Newton. All movements of the universe - of human limbs, of cogs in machines, of blood in our veins and of water in rivers - operate according to the same laws. He increasingly also came to realize that mathematics was the key to turning observations into theories. It was the language that nature used to write laws. Leonardo's paragone, occasionally rambles but it is important to remember that this polemic like many of his prophecies and parables was designed to be performed rather than published. He also pioneered sfumato, the technique to using hazy and smoky outlines. Sfumato is an analogy for the blurry distinction between the known and the mysterious. Just as he blurred the boundaries between art and science, he did so to the boundaries between reality and fantasy, between experience and mystery, between objects and their surroundings. Eighteen years after he had arrived in Milan with a lute and a letter for Ludovico proclaiming his talents as an engineer and artist, Leonardo da Vinic was returning home to France. Michelangelo and Leonardo became competitors but they had their own differences in art formation. Michelangelo tended to specialize in muscular male nudes whereas Leonardo, on the contrary prided himself on the 'universal' nature of his subjects. Michelangelo was good at delineating forms with the use of sharp lines but he showed little skill with the subtleties of sfumato, shadings, refracted lights, soft visuals or changing color perspectives. Leonardo and Michelangelo had become luminaries, paving the way for other artists - who until then had rarely even signed their work - to do the same. Leonardo adopted Francesco Melzi at the age of 55. He became a mix of legal guardian, godfather, adoptive father, teacher and an employer. During his period of intense anatomical study, Leonardo made 240 drawings and wrote at least thirteen thousand words of text, illustrating and describing every bone, muscle group and major organ in the human body for what would have been, if it had been published his most historic scientific triumph. Around 1508 while simultaneously pursuing his anatomy and earth studies in Milan, Leonardo returned to the analogy in a fascinating notebook, the Codex Leicester. More focused than most of his other notebooks, it contains 72 pages jammed with long written passages and 360 drawings on geology, astronomy and the dynamics of flowing water. Much of Leonardo's career was consumed by his quest for patrons who would be unconditionally paternalistic, supportive and indulgent in ways that his own father had only occasionally been. Leonardo was a genius but more: he was the epitome of the universal mind, one who sought to understand all of creation, including how we fit into it. | | | |"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I don't ordinarily read books a second time; there are far too many books on my to-read list. In this case, I'm so glad I read this book again. Leonardo da Vinci was a fascinating man, and we can learn a great deal from him. Da Vinci was not only a genius, he was intensely curious. We could all use an extra dose of his curiosity. In re-reading the book, I've decided it rates five stars, not four. Leonardo da Vinci was unquestionably one of the most gifted and inventive men in history. He discerned the first and third laws of motion, 200 years before Newton. He accurately described how the valves of the heart work, 450 years before science was able to prove that he was correct. Not only was Leonardo a gifted artist, he was a scientist, innovator, engineer and anatomist (Leonardo skinned at least 20 cadavers to study the underlying muscles and tendons). The challenge for Walter Isaacson was writing a biography of a man that lived 500 years ago. In the absence of the bountiful source and documentary material left behind by some individuals, Isaacson relied heavily on 7,200 pages of da Vinci’s notebooks and overcompensates with lengthy analyses of Leonardo’s works. The role of art critic is not Isaacson’s strength. He is stronger when describing Leonardo the scientist and engineer. Nevertheless, one comes away with an excellent understanding of the true genius of Leonardo da Vinci."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Curiosity and Genius Personified What more can I say that hasn’t already been said far more eloquently and insightfully by others over the centuries. Leonardo was a one-of-a-kind genius in so many fields that he defied all categories, and his personal character was just as complicated and fascinating. The best way to approach him was by listening to this excellent biography on audiobook, and watching Leonardo (2021), and 8-part Italian production in English starring Aidan Turner. He really captures to complex and insatiably curious character of Leonardo, and the storyline and period mesh very well with The Medici to give you a bigger picture. My interest was initially piqued when I got drawn into the history of the Roman Republic and Empire, it was a natural progression to want to understand the later history of the Italian Renaissance, along with all the warring city-states and complicated power struggles of them with the Papal States, European Powers, and Eastern Orthodox Church. It’s just such a convoluted and fascinating mess, and yet despite all the power struggles and brutality and violence, it also gave birth to this incredible flowering of intellectual creativity that eschewed the narrow and dogmatic Medieval Christian mentality, and produced such artistic geniuses as Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli, and the stunning architecture, much inspired by classical Greek and Roman culture."

There was little he couldn't do. In addition to his world-famous work as a painter, he was also an inventor, writer, architect, sculptor, composer, anatomist, philosopher, physicist, chemist and engineer. Drawing on thousands of pages of Da Vinci's notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Isaacson tells a beautiful story of how Da Vinci's art is intertwined with science. He shows how Da Vinci's genius was based on skills that we can improve ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation and imagination that borders on fantasy. Even for someone without any background in his art and writings, this is a most interesting book. Beautifully illustrated, with excerpts of his notebooks and illustrations of his paintings, it will leave you amazed. It turned out that a woodpecker’s tongue – because it is so long – winds around the skull through a special cavity, thereby cushioning the brain and protecting them from the damaging vibration. I wonder if Leonardo was able to figure it out. I hope he did."

Recently, I managed to read Giorgio Vasari book on Da Vinci which was a very short book. Having seen a few of Da Vinci works in museums, I have always been fascinated by him. It took me nearly a week to finish it. Learnt a lot from this massive, well researched, well written and easy to follow biography on one of the best artists of Renaissance. He was so talented. Just to name a few - painter, philosopher, mathematician, engineer, architect, scientist etc. He had a sharp eye for nearly anything. Always carrying a small notebook with him. He would write down so many things. I loved reading all about Mona Lisa. This book is a good overview of D. V's life. I strongly recommend this one especially if you appreciate Art and enjoy reading biographies."

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Much of my review agrees with that stated by Netta in her review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), though she writes it much more eloquently. Walter Isaacson presents the biography of Leonardo da Vinci, whose every action is so divine, that, surpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing bestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired by human art. (Vasari, LIFE OF LEONARDO DA VINCI) Where, I believe, Isaacson struggles in this book is thinking that one can just record the life of Leonardo using the classical structure of a biography. Although Isaacson tries to package particular events into a 'named' chapter, he does not give the reader the necessary information to formulate Leonardo da Vinci into who he was: a man who was created through the society in which he lived. So much of Leonardo da Vinci is linked to what was happening. By providing a small passage, for instance, saying something on the lines of 'Florence was invaded and held by France' dilutes what was happening, and the effects that it had on the populace, and Leonardo. Furthermore, Isaacson's descriptions of artwork is lackluster. He does not have the experience nor the knowledge of context. Perhaps Isaacson could benefit from Leonardo da Vinci's understanding that all things are connected, and nothing is singular in its happening? In my opinion, no biography of Leonardo will be sufficient until someone resolves to integrate the character of Leonardo da Vinci with the time in which he lived in, understanding and exploring the society of 15th/16th Century Italy, as well as losing the notion of 'genius' in which Leonardo is explicitly linked to throughout this biography and others. Furthermore, one should dissolve the idea of how to make Leonardo useful in the 21st century. This view inevitably leads to viewing Leonardo as a blueprint, rather than a living, breathing, feeling, man that he was. I should probably state some things I liked: * Isaacson expounds the idea that by not being legitimised, Leonardo was free from following his father's career as a notary. * Isaacson's descriptions of Leonardo's mechanical drawings are pleasant, and include images showing how Leonardo incorporated multi-layered views."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is masterfully written, lavishly illustrated, and a prime example of intensive research. I had read The author’s biography of Steve Jobs, and also the Innovators which showed how collaboration through the years has brought us to the present digital era. I knew some of Leonardo’s workbooks, journals, sketches and finished paintings were lost to history, but was amazed at how much still remains after more than 500 years. The author states that he was able to find a greater percentage of Leonardo’s thoughts and work than he was able to find when researching material on Steve Jobs while writing that biography. I feel this book should be of great interest to art historians, people who authenticate art work, students of Renaissance history, and anyone interested in what constitutes a true genius. I downloaded the Kindle version, but read it on my iPad app. It is essential to see the art work in colour, and to enlarge the paintings, and also to enlarge the black and white sketches from the notebooks which include such subjects as mechanics, engineering, geometry, botany, geology, anatomical drawings including dissections of the human body and some animals, optics, light, stage props for theatre, study of flight of birds and the possibility of machines to allow man to fly, and some very peculiar notes as reminders to himself. These notes were mainly in mirror writing. There was an insatiable curiosity about everything, and it seems that most was to satisfy his own questions, and some knowledge was to enhance his paintings regarding human and animal form,light and shadows and perspective. He did some collaboration in paintings and architecture, and laid out some plans for military strategy and weapons, but a lot was unfinished due to his distractibility, lack of diligence or interest, or the constant striving for perfection. He did not publish any of his work, and some of his theories and conclusions had to be rediscovered many years later. This was particularly unfortunate in his work on the dissections of humans, where he drew intricate illustrations on every part of the human bones, muscles, circulatory system rather than depending on old medical writings which was the method at the time. Leonardo had a lot of things working against him. He was heretical, illegitimate, gay, no formal education. He disappointed patrons and sponsors by leaving projects unfinished and frequently did not get paid for the work. His genius combined science and art and curiosity, and he was popular and much sought after by famous people in many diverse fields, such as art, mechanical engineering, architecture, military, theatre, who recognized his unique mental powers. I was especially interested in the manner the author described each illustration, and the way he analyzed each art work or scientific drawing. I had difficulty with the geometric and mechanical drawings, but was enthralled by the genius involved."

I'm GLAD I read this, but it wasn't nearly as enthralling or personal as Isaacson's Einstein. In summary (I don't have it in me to do a proper review), by the end of the novel, I didn't really feel like I had gotten to da Vinci. Sure, I knew a lot more about his paintings and his inventions (but I had already read a lot about his work prior, which is what led me to his bio); I was hoping to know more about the man. As it turns out, there's a lot that just isn't known. There are years where we've got nothing on the guy. And much of what we do know is from his own notebooks. The book is ultra-focused on his art. Where my interest piqued was learning about da Vinci in relation to Michelangelo. I always figured the masters got along (like the ninja turtles!) Turns out, da Vinci was a gregarious, happy-go-lucky guy and Michelangelo was more of a jealous prick. They didn't like each other at all, and the public pitted them in competitions against each other. Other areas that were absorbing: the amount of art out there that is pretty much ""up for speculation"" if da Vinci created it or not, and just how few pieces we have from da Vinci, because he rarely finished his work, or signed it."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I recently took a course which focused on biography and really enjoyed the texts that had been selected; I wanted to continue reading biographies and Leonardo Da Vinci seemed like a fascinating subject. I still think Leonardo is most likely a fascinating subject, but this book is long and very little of it explores his personal life. About the first two hundred pages are almost entirely art analysis, and it gets quite dry quite quickly in my opinion. My experience with biography is limited, and I’ve been lucky enough before this book to read ones which truly brought their subjects to life. It seems to be a very thoroughly researched book, so possibly the answer is that too much time has passed, and not enough personal information exists anymore. If you are an art lover interested in never-before seen full color prints of Leonardo Da Vinci’s work then I would say go for it, but if you were hoping to get to know the man himself I don’t think this is the book you are looking for."

My first review of the year is for a biography of one of the most remarkable people in human history. Sadly, and spoiler alert, the biography itself is not on par with its subject. While the glossy paper and many illustrations showcasing details of da Vinci’s work are delightful and show the author’s dedication to the subject, Isaacson falls into a trap of his own making: his unabashed anachronism mixed with a rigid unspoken belief that a genius has a duty toward humanity make large parts of this book a biased judgment over Leonardo’s life choices. Isaacson defends Leonardo in this court of his own making, true, but I don’t see why any court would or should be needed. Seriously, why Isaacson or any other Leonardo scholar, for that matter, feels that they have any right to judge Leonardo’s life? I am happy he lived at all, and feel priviledged to be able to retrace his discoveries and analyse his works of art. Why would I ever begrudge him the moments he spent on things he loved? Well, you can already see my contentious relationship with this book. I’ve been moved to defend Leonardo da Vinci on several occasions throughout my reading, to the extent that my family, used to the majority of my bookworm quirks, gave me some strange looks. On the other hand, Isaacson, when not focused on accusing Leonardo of chronic fear of finishing work, too much focus on living his actual life, or perfectionism, did a good job of collecting and cataloguing the various inventions and discoveries da Vinci made throughout his long and rich life. The list is not only extensive and incredibly varied, it is a testament to human capacity for being in the world, as an integral part of the world, and to the drive to understand the world and oneself in all their aspects. I didn’t much care for the gossipy parts concerning da Vinci’s love life or Isaacson’s projections about the father-son relationship. They seemed crass and really unnecessary. However, I do appreciate the care with which the author presented Leonardo’s key artistic works and discoveries surrounding them; it is mind-boggling to see how the need to understand everything drove Leonardo’s artistic choices and why his masterpieces took so long to be finished (or not finished). Isaacson makes the argument that the leading trait of Leonardo da Vinci’s character was curiosity. I think it was much more than just curiosity; it was the ability to see the world as deeply logical, ordered and comprehensible, and the need to know everything before you make your mark. Da Vinci saw patterns where nobody else had seen them, links and relationships between so diverse elements of the world as rivers and blood vessels, the anatomy of the eye, the color of the sky, and the way distant objects can be realistically depicted on canvas. One last thing that really set my teeth on edge: Isaacson, clearly infatuated with the subject of his previous book, kept comparing da Vinci to Steve Jobs. Seriously? I mean, really? What exactly is comparable between the two, besides some character traits shared also by millions of other people? What are Jobs’s discoveries in the areas of biology, geology, anatomy, or physics? What are his artistic masterpieces? This seemed more like a cheap product placement than a valid comparison. Well, you get the gist, so I won’t spend any more time being outraged, I prefer to spend my energy in more constructive ways :). All in all, Isaacson’s book has some good things going for it, the quality and choice of illustrations are great, and there is a lot to be learned from the parts about Leonardo’s work. I wish the book had a less gossipy feel, and I generally prefer my biographies to not display author’s personality or views, so I don’t see myself reading another of Isaacson’s works, but I think I might check out a different Leonardo biography at some point – the one indisputable value of Isaacson’s work is that it reawakened my interest in Renaissance and in Leonardo in particular."

""Leonardo da Vinci"" is Walter Isaacson's best-selling 2017 biography of the 15th century's preeminent polymath and quintessential ""Renaissance Man."" Isaacson is an author, journalist and professor at Tulane University who has also written biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein and Henry Kissinger. Leonardo may be best known for painting the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper but his interests were wide-ranging: from anatomy and architecture to fluid mechanics, geometry and music. In addition to his paintings, more than 7,000 pages of his notebooks survive - filled with a remarkable assortment of drawings, sketches, notes, doodles and calculations. These provide the prospective biographer (or enthusiastic scholar) with with enough food for thought to last a lifetime. Isaacson does a commendable job assembling as complete a narrative of Leonardo's life as may be possible given that five centuries have passed since his death. But while he has made great use of the footprints his subject left behind, much about Leonardo's inner-self and relationships remain opaque and mysterious. Fortunately, what Isaacson is able to convey of Leonardo's personality is enthralling; the genius is both undeniably intriguing and refreshingly fallible. The distillation of Isaacson's thesis: that Leonardo was a genius with a unique talent for synthesizing science and art...and yet was indelibly prone to procrastination, perfectionism and distraction. Indeed, Leonardo's unquenchable curiosity, keen eye for observation, remarkable talent for documenting and his cross-disciplinary competencies make him utterly fascinating. What Isaacson gets right in this biography is impressive. His narrative is consistently articulate and accessible and the reader often feels as though he or she is inside the author's head (if not always his subject's). And the book's ""Introduction,"" which provides a rationale for tackling this particular individual, is nothing if not enthralling. Anyone uninterested in learning more about Leonardo da Vinci after reading the first nine pages of this biography might be incapable of being impressed...or entranced. While many biographies rigorously cover a subject's life chronologically, Isaacson's book proceeds more-or-less topically. After introducing Leonardo's early life and apprenticeship the chapters tend to cover a particular work or series of works - but in a generally chronological order. And throughout these subject-oriented chapters the reader is provided liberal doses of insightful context and fascinating forensic analyses regarding each of Leonardo's major works. Isaacson's observations regarding the evolution of Leonardo's painting style and technique is also surprisingly interesting as is the focus on how Leonardo's scientific interests and studies - of wave motion and human anatomy, for instance - influenced his artistic renderings. And one of this book's bonus features: its high-quality glossy pages which enhance the nearly 150 paintings, drawing and sketches which have been reproduced for the reader...my apologies to anyone favoring an audio format! But fans of traditional biographies who are not enamored with Renaissance Italy or art history will find a bones of contention. Leonardo's character and personal relationships remain relatively elusive due to his reluctance to record his personal thoughts. Also, the book focuses more on painting and other artistic techniques than some will fully appreciate. Finally, the book ends with a chapter providing the author's view of lessons we should take from Leonardo's life. These aphorisms (such as ""Retain a childlike sense of wonder"" and ""Let your reach exceed your grasp"") will seem out of place to many readers...and corny to a few. Overall, though, Walter Isaacson's ""Leonardo da Vinci"" is a wonderfully vibrant book (both physically and in its literary style) which does a remarkable job exploring the life of one of the world's great creative geniuses. Readers who delight in traditional biographies might focus on what's missing: more insight into Leonardo's personal life, his most important relationships and his foibles. But for most, this book provides an excellent review of a remarkable - and remarkably fascinating - life. Overall rating: 4¼ stars"

He also wrote biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Einstein, Kissinger, Steve Jobs, and others. Leonardo da Vinci, together with his young rival Michelangelo were regarded as stars in their lifetime. Especially Leonardo had reached a status that would impress popes and princes. They all wanted to have Leonardo shine at their court. He had a colourful life. Moving from Vinci to Florence, to Milan, to Rome and finally, to France, he worked for Cesare Borgia, Charles d’Amboise, Pope Leo X, Ludovico Sforza, and King Francis I. In my mind, Leonardo da Vinci had been the most accomplished man, both a thinker and a craftsman. There is no doubt Leonardo da Vinci was a Genius. But I am disappointed by Leonardo’s human nature. In his younger years, he was a dandy, an entertainer, a misfit in many ways; gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. As an illegitimate child, he had no formal education, no Latin or Greek and shortcomings in mathematical skills. His curiosity, relentless and obsessional and his outstanding sense of observation about nature, arts, sciences, and technologies made up for everything. But he was also unreliable, over time left a trail of projects unfinished, like the paintings of the Adoration Scene and a The Battle mural, flying machines that never flew, tanks that never rolled, the Arno River never diverted and many more of the like. Most unfortunately for future generations, he left some four thousand notes of brilliant scientific observations for treatises that he never published. A perfectionist he thought of his work as not finished, not complete and always meant to improve on it. In the end, he became reluctant to pick up a brush, he did not seem to care that his genius came to its best conclusion and was best expressed in his paintings. He was a Genius and the works he finished are proof enough. The Mona Lisa as well as his other masterpieces, The Last Supper, Lady with an Ermine, La belle Ferroniere, Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Madonna of the Yarnwinder, Saint John and others. Leonardo da Vinci was one of the few men in history who tried to know all that was to know about everything that could be known in his time."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Marvelous. This life was magnificent beyond any telling for his unique and kind (but often rascally) genius of such multiple skills and talents of mind set into a time that was both cruel and beautiful. It's beyond my ability to describe Leonardo's scope. But the only star loss for the rating was in the weight and stiffness of the pages in this book. It was nearly impossible to hold and many of the photo plates/ pages so rigid I could not lay them flat enough to give their observation justice. I would guess the quality of the materials to be the highest but this is so long with so much of the visual- that at times it was a detriment. The information and writing about da Vinci by Isaacson was 5 star. And I do disagree with some of the other reviewers concerning how Leonardo rather ""hid"" and didn't widely market all his belief or non-belief or particulars of anatomy information etc. He could not do so in the sense of how that kind of genius would market himself today ( a la a Stephen Hawking kind of celebrity presence). Because he would not have had access and/or safety to do and follow his momentary or long term inclinations to building or drawing or whatever. He would have been deemed a heretic or worse. With horrific consequence for this era and location. And he always had to placate those who hired him as well. Even if it wasn't always on every direction of time limits or exact desired ""boss"" order, there had to be some connections of allegiance. What was the most remarkable WAS that he also remained ""of his time"" in nearly all, regardless of which practical applications or depth he plummeted. Can you imagine those 3 or 4 winter months when he was in such ""trapped"" close quarters in that tiny town behind 15 foot wide walls with both C. Borgia and Niccolo Machiavelli! All ""stuck"" there. He had to be a wizard too at dinner talk wit plus within diplomatic asides to get advantage for his project or current art or inquiry. Beyond all his superb scientific detail minutia discovered over decades- that is a rare, rare skill. And he was not quiet or a minimal talker either and yet had to stay ""out"" of all the ""cracks"". Isaacson gave you the full picture of that particular skill and his personality too."

In this world where we're too busy because of [insert reasons here] most of us loose our childhood ability to wonder why the sky is blue, if my color of Red is the same as yours or if there's like planets out there. Or any of the throngs of other questions about ourselves, the Universe and the nature of reality. Though I strive to be curious on a daily basis, this comes with a scattering of focus and sometimes the bleak specter of procrastination. Although a fellow procrastinator himself, Leonardo has achieved so much in his life that it's just wondrous . I have to confess that I'm not really a big fan of art, as anything which is subjected to 'opinion' is extremely hard to look upon objectively. For example can be considered art? Or, better yet, are worth millions of dollars? Despite this, Leonardo managed to connect science and art masterfully by observing nature, dissecting animals (humans are included here) and experimenting on a daily basis. His genius, with ups and downs, lied in exploring his curiosity and if there's something you should take away from my review besides the awesome videos linked above, it's a plea to try and be more curious by shifting your perspective and asking 'why?' even if the answer might seem obvious."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I had high hope of this book. I always like a good biography that I can learn everything As much I can about the subject. What can go wrong when the subject is Leonardo da Vinci? Well, Mr. Isaacson’s boring writing and his subjective view towards Leonardo. There is no doubt Isaacson did enough research. But that’s only good thing I can say about this book. You will learn the whole life of Leonardo if that’s what you want to know. The writing is just too boring and monotone. It’s so hard to keep me engaged throughout 500 plus pages. I have to say this is the only biography I read that I like the subject less after reading. I understand Isaacson is writing a book about Leonardo, but that doesn’t mean everything Leonardo did was brilliant or had a deep meaning. We can not deny Leonardo was a genius, but let’s just appreciate him as what he really was, a brilliant painter. Personally I just don’t think he did enough we can label him as an engineer. What exactly did he do about engineering, except coming up unrealistic ideas that he never even started or close to finished? Leonardo enjoyed learning things and was curious about everything. That’s good and maybe we should learn from that. But that’s about it, curiosity, nothing more. Isaacson is singing praise in his book on everything Leonardo did, and put it very lightly on his flaws. I just cannot agree the author’s point of view. A good writer uses his book to arouse readers’ interest to explore and to learn, not throw his personal view at you in such a subjective way."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Fascinating book about an amazing man - so far ahead of his time that he seems almost like a time traveller from the future inserted into an earlier time. Interesting on his temperament as well - didn't realise that he had so many unfinished works - you could possibly even include the Mona Lisa in that as he made changes to it over many years and still had it with him when he died. This book was also full of drawings and paintings by Da Vinci which added to the narrative in making it a very comprehensive study of the great man. Now well briefed, I can go along to this exhibition before it finishes:"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"We toss around this word, genius, until its definition is meaningless. I thought I knew Leonardo da Vinci. Don't we all? We hear about him as children (in my case via The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, first, but nevermind) and then throughout our lives. Most of us recognize that he was a true genius, in the sense that is actually meaningful. We're awed by his art and inspired by his inventions. But it turns out, we knew nothing. I knew nothing. I had not a g-damn clue. I'm not sure I've ever finished a book, biography or otherwise, feeling so humbled. And a little bit enraged. What if Leonardo had published his papers? Who and where would we be now? A hundred years more advanced than we are? Two hundred? Jesus."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},The book is very good because Walter Isaacson is good. But there is a lot in here that did not need to be in here. I understand what he is trying to do and I appreciate it: this is the mind of a genius. There are biographers (Caro is the master of the art) and there are those who use biographies to make a broader point. I feel like Isaacson should have gone with the second impetus in this one because that is where the book shines--the end especially where he distills what makes Leonardo so great. But the biographical bits were just kind of boring.

I did not know about all of his other ambitions. Leonardo was so much more.He was a scientist, mathematician, along with studying anatomy, birds and flight. He was a man before his time. This book was very well written and extensively researched. It is filled with sketches of his paintings and notations from his notebook. It is a wonderful journey through Leonardo’s life.

I liked the personality of Leonardo, depicted in it - a man of great talent, imagination and curiosity, always pursuing perfection, yet also a great procrastinator, easily distracted by anything that manages to capture his attention. His life, it seems, was one of a genius, but also of a human being with his doubts, problems, insecurities and mistakes."

He does a far better job than most other art historians or docents I’ve heard explaining the ways of why Leonardo’s arts are so revered throughout the centuries. It was filled with the right balance of Leonardo’s personal life peccadilloes (necessary to understand his point of view), and the artist’s eye so as not be either too much of a titillating voyeur or a dry art history class."

But the writing was stellar and kept me engaged throughout . Also there were many illustrations and pictures of da Vinci's notes , sketches and paintings that were intriguing . Do you know how long the tongue of a woodpecker is ? Leonardo was curious in this and thousands of other things , and I am amazed at what I learned about the woodpecker's tongue !"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Isaacson built his biography on Leonardo’s fascinating, richly illustrated, mirror-written notebooks. The notes reveal his boundless curiosity, his unique powers of observation, his experiments, his thirst for knowledge. He could be absorbed in studying anatomy, analyzing every muscle in the body. While painting the Mona Lisa, he did a thoroug analysis of the hundreds of small muscles that move the mouth and create a smile. He studied the movement of water, the sediments of rocks, the movement of bird wings. He observed things no one else has: for example, he noticed that the speed of moving the wings upwards is not the same as downwards, and it differs by bird species! He made scientific discoveries that no one else has before; created detailed and beautifully illustrated anatomic descriptions. Alas, Leonardo studied for his own pleasure, and was not interested in sharing his knowledge. As it was, others had to discover most of what he has found, centuries later. He could have advanced science greatly - but his interest was in the discovery, not in organizing his writings for publishing. He pursued what interested him, and if he got bored or stalled, he moved on. He was notorious for not finishing projects - hanging onto some of them for decades, continually perfecting them, as he was never satisfied. He took the same approach to art as science - he studied, he experimented, he wanted to achieve the best portrayal of human experience and nature. In fact, he never separated his art from his science and inventions - they are all jumbled together in his notes, they aid each other, meld into his genius. He considered himself an engineer. He designed many ingenious contraptions, many ahead of their time, but most impractical, and almost none were built. He was considered foremost an artist, a painter. He grew to be a legend, the best of the best - kings, princes, duchesses vied for his services. Very few of his paintings survive, mostly because he never finished them - yet the ones that do attest to his genius. Isaacson delivers a fascinating insight into Leonardo’s mind through his notes, and great analysis of his known works. The books is worth reading just for that. He is less successful in giving a concise narrative of his life, or a description of his character. We learn of his studies and obsessions, but we don’t get a good sense of what his life was like. This is still a very good book, but I did not feel the magic that the Steve Jobs biography had - possibly because Isaacson could not interview Leonardo and his friends and family, but I felt his interest lay in those notes - which are fascinating, after all. I have listened to the audio, which came with a pdf that is an absolute must when discussing Leonardo’s paintings, drawings and designs. Narrator Alfred Molina was excellent."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I learned many things reading this book, including, but not limited to, the following: Leonardo's attitude towards painting was that of being really good at doing a hobby. (!!) He abandoned a lot of his commissions because he would rather leave it unfinished than finish it imperfectly. Leonardo really wanted to get involved in military engineering, but a lot of his ideas were either abandoned or deemed - most likely by others - too fanciful to pursue. His notebooks contain an abundance of ahead-of-its-time observations and analysis, notably, ""the sun does not move."" Either it did not occur to Leonardo to publish his work, or he just did not get to do it. He would doodle on his notebook pages, his favorite to draw being a grim, old man. He was not that great at math, but that did not stop him from trying. He was obsessed with the motions of water. He was just as obsessed with learning everything there is about the human body. He did a lot of dissections, including that of an old man whom he spoke with before he died peacefully. (!!!) Although Isaacson writes Leonardo was a vegetarian for moral reasons, it apparently did not stop him from pursuing knowledge; Leonardo once dissected a pig with a still beating heart to study the blood flow in the heart. (!!!!!) Leonardo said Michelangelo's rendition of the male body was rigid and devoid of grace, and looking at Michelangelo's drawings of the body muscles looked like looking at ""a sack of walnuts."" (LMAO.) Michelangelo, too, did not have any kind things to say about Leonardo. The facts that Leonardo hung on to his paintings to keep working on them, and researched and experimented primarily for his own knowledge, testifies to the notion that Leonardo was, above all else, passionately and relentlessly curious, and also happened to be one of the most brilliant painters in the world."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Beautiful, but was bit frustrating for me at times (but that's partially due to me) as it felt like art history book at times, but that's where its beauty lies. If you are reading it, make sure you have painting/art piece opened in front of you on laptop or phone, otherwise it would be tough to appreciate the genius of Leonardo. Moreover, the life of Leonardo isn't structured or doesn't contain as much personal information as is available in case of Einstein and Jobs (I really liked those biographies by Isaacson) since there aren't enough primary sources available in case of Leonardo. But overall, book is good and I didn't expect it to finish this soon!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Read for a book group. I thought his first book, The Wise Men, about US foreign policy makers from 1920 to 1970, was excellent. He read a lot of original material and offered balanced assessments of his subjects. But this seems based on secondary sources and reads like an infatuated fan’s letter. I’m not sure it adds anything to already available biographies, and doesn’t have the sophistication of an author who has a professional background in art history or science. Instead, Isaacson has ‘hunches.’ A disappointment."

I bought the hard cover book and I'm glad I did. This is just a beautiful book, with 144 images of Leonardo's paintings and drawings all on high quality paper. The writing is just fantastic; it doesn't read like your typical history book. I was riveted to Leonardo's story from page one. He was an amazing person, and successfully combined art and science like no other person of his time. I think most people are familiar with who Leonardo was, and have a basic understanding that he was one of the notable people of the Renaissance. This book takes a close look at Leonardo's life starting with his out-of-wedlock birth to his death in France after a long life, probably one of the most interesting lives I've every read about. He was one of the smartest men of his time, not because he was born a genius, but because he had an insatiable appetite for knowledge. He wanted to understand the world - from anatomy, to astronomy, to engineering, to geology, and everything in between. Some of his scientific theories and inventions were centuries ahead of their time. Amazing, just amazing! We know all this because he left behind 7,200 pages of notes which survived over the last 500 years. Oh, and he was a notable painter, too. Have you ever heard of or the ? My favorite parts of this book were his scientific discoveries and theories. There were a lot of ""wow"" moments for me. I had no idea that Leonardo dabbled in so many of the sciences. I also really liked the in-depth analysis of some of his paintings and sketches, and the accounts of his encounters with Michelangelo. The parts about Michelangelo paint him as a 15th century crab-ass who was no fan of our hero. They had little in common outside of being the best artists of their time. I can't recommend this book highly enough, especially to history buffs. I'm glad I bought the hard cover over the audiobook as I was able to see the images of Leonardo's drawings and painting while the author described them. There is an extensive description if and a number of his other famous paintings, and a whole chapter describing the . The book also includes a cast of characters, notes, and an index. Ten stars.

I had high hopes, but I think even if I didn't I would still be disappointed. The research was there, but the execution was...unbelievably annoying. I swear to god every single page was repetitive. There was hardly anything I didn't already know about Leonardo, and I'm no expert. The people in Leonardo's life were described as caricatures, the Italians tending toward unappreciative, rough, and uncultured while the French were described as gentile and graceful. The description of Isabella D'Este pissed me off the most - she was a grabby, pushy ""collector"" according to this book, but was actually one of the first ever female art curators, and the only one of her time. She had incredible taste and could spot masters a mile away, even in their youth. Then there were the comparisons to Steve Jobs. As if they are even comparable - not to mention stupid and anachronistic. I don't care about some lame slide in Steve Jobs's presentations to Apple. I care about Leonardo's life!! There were a lot of things that could have been explored further instead of repeating ""swirls and curls,"" ""sfumato"", and ""doting patron"" over and over again. It was mentioned that Leonardo and Michelangelo had different understandings and ways of living with their homosexuality, but literally NO connections were made to the very real legal consequences to homosexuality - or even simple sodomy, or any non-traditional sexual acts (even fellatio was ruled out) - even though they are highly documented and documented to be flouted and ignored during the rule of the Medici but severely reinstated after Savonarola gained power. Might that have had something to do with Leonardo's departure from Florence? Then there is the oft-mentioned relationship with Salai, but there is no mention of the culturally accepted relationships between student/teacher and accepted homosexual relationships between elderly men and youthful boys, which are documented and have essays and books written on specifically Florence's iteration of the phenomenon during the Renaissance. It's incredibly frustrating that there is no context to any of Leonardo's life-changing qualities which would give the reader a clearer understanding of who he was as a private person instead of simply who he was as an artist."

You will understand the man and his works on a deeper level. I learned so much that I will take with me for the rest of my life from this biography of one of the most interesting men that ever lived. (If you haven't read Van Gogh's biography, on my list, same thing, I felt like I knew the man by the time I reached the last page.) To understand Leonardo is to understand life in some way. He's both an open book and a mystery never to be solved. He was a mere mortal worthy of being called a genius. At the heart of his genius was a passionately curious soul. One leaves this biography understanding the man and his work on such a deeper level. The chapter on the Mona Lisa comes toward the end and it's a revelation. It is at this point when much that has come before meets up in this one work of art. It is stunning to behold as the author of this biography parts it out. I have so many thoughts to share but for now I will end it with the authors advice on how to be more like Da Vinci. Most of which I have done for as long as I can recall. I'll add more to this review later but for now: - be relentlessly curious - seek knowledge for its own sake - retain a childlike sense of wonder - observe - start with the details - see things unseen - go down the rabbit holes - get distracted - respect facts - procrastinate - let the perfect be the enemy of the good - think visually - avoid silos - let your reach exceed your grasp - indulge fantasy - create for yourself, not just for patrons - collaborate - make lists - take notes, on paper - be open to mystery"

This made me assume that he, Leonardo, must have been a devoted Christian like the majority during his time. Yet, despite being religious, Leonardo believed that God's creation can be understood via art and science, not the doctrine passed down by the church. This bit surprised me because having such an idea could be severely punished by the church like what was done to Giordano Bruno. More importantly, from this book we learn that Leonardo believed moonlight was reflected, the ocean was held by earth, the earth and the sun isn't the center of the universe. Again, these views were quite radical and revolutionary. My personal favorite part of the book is when the author summed up some of Leonardo's habits into a phrase that states, ""not all knowledge must be useful. Sometimes it should be pursued for pure pleasure."" I'd been trying to talk myself out of searching for information that doesn't relate to my profession or might not able to help me professionally in the future, but after reading Leonardo's biography, maybe they will not remain useless at all."

Ah, then you're in for a pleasant surprise because da Vinci was that and much more. He was an accomplished: * Engineer who invented and sketched designs of machinery for military, manufacturing and aerodynamic applications. * Mathematician who pondered (and, in many cases, solved) complex problems in geometry. * Playwright and theatrical designer who created stages sets and costumes for pageants that entertained royalty and entire city populaces. * Anatomist who dissected and studied more than 30 human cadavers and whose sketches of the inner working of the human body informed his artwork. * Astronomer whose study of the night skies may have led hi to the conclusion that the earth rotates around the sun. * Etc. * Etc. Here is a person who pursued his curiosity in so many disciplines and to such lengths that he became the archetypal Renaissance Man. Reading his life story is an inspiration to realize as much of one's God-given potential as can be achieved in the scant 70 or 80 years we given on the planet."

As a newly minted art teacher, I figured I should probably bulk up my knowledge. This book has made some waves since it was released this past fall, and for good reasons. It is as instructive as it is engaging, and uses the sources available (especially his notebooks) to not only summarize da Vinci's life, but adds depth and educated conclusions about his thought and research processes. It ultimately gives a great deal of insight into this fascinating person and brilliant mind. I found out only after the book concluded that this was an abridged edition for audio and I'm curious what was cut. Looking at the visual material that accompanies this book is an absolute must and is fortunately available for free through Audible here: (no sign up is required, and no, I did not listen to this book through Audible.)"

Isaacson (author of the other award winning biography's Steve Jobs, Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin) does a splendid job here in his latest work. In this beautiful hefty book you'll experience a personal guided tour of the life and works of the man who can only be called a genius. You'll enjoy learning things you didn't even think you wanted to know and perhaps decide that endless curiosity can be a curated gift. Certainly makes me want to return to the Louvre and see some of his works again now that I have a little more understanding. Highly recommend this one. 5 stars"

I initially had it set at a 2-star rating in my mind, but then I realized that the only thing I actually found to be worthwhile were all the images of Da Vinci's work, which of course has nothing what so ever to do w/ the author (or his work in this text). As far as the actual book goes, like it said, it just isn't good. I found the author to be distasteful & untrustworthy, & the text itself was clunky, disjointed, highly repetitive, & self-aggrandizing. This was my 1st encounter with this author, & as the experience was so thoroughly off-putting, it's sure to be the last."

In more or less chronological order; there is some bouncing back and forth, Isaacson goes into granular detail of Leonardo's life and accomplishments. The resources he used were MASSIVE and COMPREHENSIVE. It must have consumed thousands of hours of research !! A highly recommended read as is any of Isaacson's other biographies."

I tried hard to push through in hopes of getting from the dry boring parts to something more interesting, but as other readers that gave this book low ratings mentioned...this book was mostly describing his art and the technicalities of how he made it rather than giving a compelling narrative of Leonardo as a brilliant artist and human.

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Not so much a biography, as much as it is an elementary analysis of various works and research conducted by Leonardo. Very long and redundant."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"'His notebooks are the greatest record of curiosity ever created, a wondrous guide to the person whom the eminent art historian Kenneth Clark called ""the most relentlessly curious man in history.""' A single noun cannot pin down Leonardo. He cannot be cajoled into fixing in one enterprise, for a man who is Renaissance man, boundaries seem non-existent by believing that ' ' What transcendence to perceive the world in that way! As he had ' ', it's such an interesting philosophy to build a foundation on. Imagine you subscribed to that: when you read the biographies of Napoleon or the court of Catherine the Great, in parallel you would see the physics that composes each of those figures, the architecture of their time, the different economic systems employed. That unity is the reality of the situation, no event is without threads which bundle together to make a complex scene arise. It is only in our biological shortcuts that we stereotype, categorise, and shut out complexity. By never losing sight of the 10,000 things, Leonardo became what he became. And I imagine his moment to moment experience was the much richer for it. This led to him not just painting the Lady of Ermine, but but he also studied intently the fossils on mountains, the way water flowed, designing towns, optics (which were actually parts of his painting), flowers, and just nature in general. In consequence, working under the unity of nature, this probably allowed him to utilise his memory in an even more efficient way. If memory is dependent on connections to things already in long term memory, for someone who implicitly believes in the unity of everything, wouldn't that just be a natural by-product? No wonder, ' ' Another wondrous thing he does, which most writers, directors must all possess to some degree is: ' ' More formally introduced by Isaacson in his chapter on The Science of Art, he described Leonardo's trademark talent: ' ' Like Einstein, he possessed this combinatory creativity. It's interesting that arguably two of history's greatest geniuses owed their success, their fervour to their ability to imagine new worlds in their minds, to use like lego blocks the phenomena in front of them and to transform it in some way. Paradoxically, it seems that imaginative activity for adults is seen as childlike, ineffectual, but the very act of imagination is employed by generals, directors and really in any piece of technology ever manufactured. Why do we have the proclivity to shed such an indispensable tool as we nestle into adulthood? Born out of wedlock, Leonardo was ' ', he takes pride in ' ' Similar to other independent thinkers, ' ' He eventually worked as an apprentice to Verrocchio, his first recorded piece of art was a shield with a ' ' - the first indication of combining observation with imagination. As he observed nature, his favourite pattern was nature's spirals. He saw this both in the curls of angels but also in the flow of a river. Something that I was pleasantly surprised to find out was '' One man, Salai would be a recurring character throughout his life. It was interesting to view the stumbles he met when painting. For example, with the Adoration of the Magi, the task became too big, and he had to reduce the number of characters involved. His goal was ' ' This he had to with thirty characters instead of the original sixty. He eventually moved to Milan from Florence, which as ' ' in this bigger city allowed him to meet people from a greater variety of fields. In a memorable scene, Leonardo writes perhaps the greatest CV ever, highlighting his military engineering abilities despite never having ' '. Another way of Leonardo's thinking was using analogy: when he created a utopian city, he ' ' What houses all these ideas were ' ' Just as Mark Twain, Anais Nin, General Patton have done after him, the power of a notebook cannot be doubted. As Isaacson beautifully describes: ' ' Charlie Munger says a very similar thing, as does Shane Parrish at Farnam Street. This type of interconnected thinking seems to lead to more ingenuity and joy in learning. This makes sense for Leonardo, as he ' '. Leonardo played several roles: military engineer, stage creator for plays, painter, architect, writer of novellas, amongst many others. He was also a vegetarian who arrived at that choice as he realised that ' '. Other famous creations of Leonardo was the Vitruvian man which quoting Toby Lester considers it to embody ' ' I think art more than anything with its deficit of words could come closest to that approximation. One interesting affect of the Vitruvian man was that Isaacson talks about how in making it Leonardo talked to others, that he was very collaborative. He ' ' This happily dispels the romantic notion that genius only appears if you stay settled in solitude long enough. Again staying on the topic of his thinking, I will write some more quotes on how he saw the world: ' The above were heightened by ' . How do you better observe scenes? Leonardo advises: ' ' Examples of his own observations were bird watching, the pressure on the wings. Some notable events in his life were: meeting Machiavelli, the king of France taking a liking to him, being turned off the horrors of war by being with Borgia who was ruthless (like Einstein and his former friend Fritz Haber). In a very distorted version of House MD, he went to hospitals to dissect the bodies Perhaps more than any other individual, Leonardo is someone to emulate. Not for the desire to leave lasting artefacts in the world but principally the pure joy one must feel to create these wonders from your own mind, to see the unity of nature so closely, and to extend it in imagination. I will carefully consider adopting even a small amount of the thinking of Leonardo. The conclusion of the book is worth the price alone, where Isaacson distils some of the lessons we can apply to our own lives. Three Lessons Learned: 1. Be relentlessly curious with what you read or study. Leonardo has shown that you can maximise that to a really intense degree. Critical thinking, Socratic questioning aids in this. And be a disciple of experience, as stringently independent as possible. 2. When you read a biography of Napoleon or of Mao, be aware of the unity of nature. This aids in long term memory, as you are categorising, you are chunking the material into a more meaningful pattern as Daniel Bor (The Ravenous Brain) would advise. Also, it's just a lot more enjoyable. 3. When you have read a new book or a part of history, use fantasia to imagine alternatives, to imagine Leonardo designing military equipment for the First Battle of the Marne. In short, have a much more active mind."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Probably more has been written about Leonardo da Vinci than any other human in European cultural history. It defies logic to think that anything new can be added to the mountain of scholarly, and popular, understanding of a single human being who appears to have been the greatest genius who ever lived. Yet, books still get written and fresh interpretations spring up as regularly as summer weeds. This newest offering is well researched and oozing with details I’ve never heard before. It flows well and is very readable. The illustrations are gorgeous and the quality of the physical book itself is impressive. It is meant to be kept and valued for a long time. But, the author falls into some common da Vinci traps. The biggest one I think is the one that most scholars tumble into. The first mistake is to mystify da Vinci’s achievements and insights. Leonardo’s big point of difference with his contemporaries was that he trusted his eyes. Direct observation was at the core of everything he did. This was no mean feat at a time when dogma, convention and even the inquisition impacted heavily on artists’ views of the world. His singular penchant for believing his eyes before anything else put da Vinci well out in front of even the greatest luminaries of his time. Isaacson acknowledges this but I don’t think he gives it the weight it deserves. It’s more than something da Vinci did, it WAS his essence and almost exclusively his only point of difference from his contemporaries. The second mistake is to think of da Vinci as being anything other than an artist. By his own admission, he had no formal education, however he was a student and apprentice of the great master Verrocchio from the time he was twelve until he was in his early twenties. This was is only education and he could rightly boast of being a trained, professional artist by the standards of the time and all that implied. Any master artist of the 15th or 16th centuries was expected to be able to design anything from a belt buckle to an architectural complex, cannons to festival floats. It wasn’t extraordinary, that he could make sculptures or engineer machines. He just did it with more finesse than most. Isaacson, like so many others, goes on about Leonardo’s ‘science’ and this really annoys me. Science, as we know it, did not exist in his day. The method was developed over the next two hundred years through painful fits and starts and hard won advancements by many pioneers. Science starts with observation – Leonardo’s great skill – but through rigorous trail and provable, repeatable experimentation, systematic documentation and objective analysis informs our world in a logical, factual way. For all of his extraordinary powers of observation, and inventive synthesis of what he learned many of his conclusions were false and based on assumptions, speculation or intuition. Many of his – so called – experiments and inventions, literally, never made it off the page or when built later, didn’t work – for example, his helicopter or his tank. I’ve been fascinated by da Vinci since I was a child. We had only two prints hanging in our family home when I was growing up, a copy of the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. From the time I was fifteen I trained as a painter, sculptor and printmaker. I have worked in every medium Leonardo used including silverpoint, egg tempera and I’ve studied anatomy even using human cadavers. I have a Master of Fine Arts degree. The more I learn about art and, critically, the more I create art the more I understand and appreciate da Vinci’s true achievements from pioneering the study of anatomy as a discipline to improving depiction of the human form through a thorough respect and understanding of the play of light on a form to the development of the technique of sfumato. The fourth thing Isaacson gets wrong is that, as far as I can tell, he doesn’t have experience actually making art. He relies on the critical assessments of experts in their fields and he gets some things wrong. For example, in describing the materials and process of drawing in silver point he talks about the patina of the surface. In fact, the silver stylus deposits a thin layer of silver on the gesso treated surface and it is this layer that oxidizes, not the surface itself. I know this is a pedantic point but it goes to the kind of knowledge needed to properly talk about these techniques, materials and more importantly the critical assessment of his works. His understanding of other important artistic concepts, techniques, materials and terminology are equally flawed, for example, he refers to the paint used by Leonardo prior to picking up the new medium of oil paint from Flanders as ‘tempera paint’. To contemporary readers this is defined as the water-based, powdery, flaky stuff your four year old paints with at playschool. What Leonardo, and every artist in Europe, used if they were not doing frescos on walls was ‘egg tempera’. What’s the difference? Egg tempera uses the yolk of an egg as a binder instead of oil, gum or wax. The resulting technique used is very specific, highly disciplined, painstakingly slow and lends itself to rendering tight, highly detailed images. Isaacson totally misses a monumental shift, equal to the development of convergent perspective, that oil paint brought to western art in general and Leonardo’s work specifically. In this discipline Leonardo certainly developed a specifically Italian perspective and practices that would influence countless artists until now. One of the most irritating things Isaacson does, over and over again, is point out Leonardo’s signature shading technique using hatching, the accumulation of tight lines coming in a diagonal direction from the top left to lower on the right. Yes, da Vinci did this but it is not unique nor even unusual. Left-handed individuals make up about ten percent of the general population but, in my experience, between forty to sixty percent of artist. Any artist who is left-handed will use exactly the same technique by virtue of the natural motion of the hand. Again, Isaacson would have known this if he had ever done any drawing. Isaacson makes much of da Vinci’s quest to pair physical gestures with emotions. This is not extraordinary but part and parcel of narrative picture making. Again, Leonardo does it better than any of his contemporaries but he didn’t invent the technique. Perhaps Isaacson’s biggest mistake is his belittling of Michelangelo as Leonardo’s nemesis. His analysis of Buonarroti’s techniques are inaccurate to the degree of being the opposite of what he actually achieved. Michelangelo was one of the three behemoths of an age of giants. To dismiss him as some hack who made flat representations of the human figure, or even to lend credence to Leonardo’s parlour-room jibe that his figures looked like sacks of walnuts is an embarrassing joke. Not enough is made of Leonardo’s obvious flaw, his whopping huge failure to finish projects, until the conclusion of the book. His distraction, and even obvious avoidance of practicing art consistently is understandable considering his capacity for curiosity but it also hints at a possible ADD which is never explored. It also suggest a penchant for fear of failure. His experimentation with bizarre wall painting formulas in light of the proven results achievable with the fresco technique (as STILL evident in the Sistine Chapel) suggest little respect for his clients or enough experimental research beforehand to warrant even attempting these techniques. It makes me wonder how often, when he felt low, he could give himself a thorough self-pummelling and consider himself the biggest failure in history – which is a highly arguable point. His reputation as one of the three pivotal artist of the Renaissance rests on less than twenty finished paintings. Compare this to fifty-four for his arch-rival Michelangelo one of those being the Sistine ceiling. Having said all of this, the book did get me to re-examine Leonardo in a fresh way and to reconsider everything I have believed, thought of or observed about the great master and that could never be a totally bad thing."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Leonardo Da Vinci was always somebody I revered growing up. The reverence grew significantly after I read The Da Vinci code, and got a ""detailed glance"" (I'm hoping the oxymoron can convey Dan Brown's style) at the maestro. The interest for Da Vinci's mind spiked in me once again 2 years back when I was researching some topics in neuroscience and the structure of the human anatomy, and it got the better of me once a friend recommended this book personally to me on Goodreads. And I was not disappointed, in the slightest! (I speak as if I have a high bar for literature, but I'm rather easy to please) Leonardo Da Vinci truly was a genius ahead of his time and he mastered every imaginable craft at the time. He lived the life of a misunderstood genius that was ahead of his time. Painting, sculpting, writing, weapons-design, and just about anything a human could professionally do back in the 15th and 16th centuries. There is so much more to be spoken about this man, but this is a book review. It is not about the man as such, but about how the man has been painted in this work of literature. Also, it was surprising to learn how Da Vinci understood the significance of the source of his food even back then. Apparently, he was a vegetarian by choice and practiced abstinence from animal-cruelty. He would often set pigeons and other birds free in the market to study their flight, but also to liberate them. The beauty of this book stems from how the author has studied a man who lived more than 5 centuries ago. It is anything but a singular, atomic task to narrate a story that is from a different time. The author has done his due diligence in studying every possible manuscript left behind by the maestro. He has studied every painting he could watch and observe, and he has re-built the version of the world that existed back then. The book is also a history lesson (quite importantly so) on relevance of Florence in those times. It was a city of artists and engineers and explorers that was ahead of its time in both how it was ruled and the liberties of the people. This city had an important hand in shaping the man that Leonardo Da Vinci became. More importantly, this book not only shows the greatness of Da Vinci, it tries to paint his picture as neutrally as possible. Isaacson has also shone a light on Da Vinci's demons and the darkness that would sometimes get the best of him. Unfinished paintings, a distracted mind, an utter perfectionist, and some more traits that drove him insane and kept him from achieving the same greatness as some of his contemporaries. I found those parts of the book quite valuable as they showcased the things that probably differentiated him from Godhood. It's okay to be flawed, as long as we never lose our curiosity to understand ourselves and the world around us and the difference between right and wrong. The rabid curiosity which drove Da Vinci to accomplish the things he did, is a rare sight today. To be as curious, kind and empathetic is the dream that makes a man an artist."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Had I not attended a Panel discussion organized with Walter Isaacson for the promotion of this book, I don't know if I would have ever read it. I'm not a painter, and I tried to stay away from Physics in school and college as much as I could, and it turns out these were prominent areas of interest for Leonardo among others. In spite of that, I was able to enjoy the narrative in the book even when Walter is trying to explain how Leonardo's curious mind worked out the foundations (and probably even advanced matters) of the disciplines of optics, anatomy, mechanics, hydraulics, etc. centuries before they were invented. Halfway through the book, once you've familiarised yourself with Leonardo, you wonder how he would feel about us trying to understand him with a curiosity which is comparable, if not equivalent (and definitely not more), to his inquisitiveness about all things nature has created. Before reading this book, I knew him as the famous painter who painted the Last Supper and Mona Lisa, but once I realised the intricacies of the process that he underwent while he painted these and others, it helped me appreciate him so much more. Like Walter points out, Leonardo was a genius and not through some god gifted IQ, but by his proclivities and probably through his comfort with his procrastination. He raised questions and went through quite tedious and rigorous processes to answer them himself. The fact that he never wanted to relinquish any work of art he started and in this process, he left a few pieces unfinished makes his genious more believable and relatable. You might end up wishing that he had the discipline to finish and publish his treatises, but if he had let himself be engaged in that, he probably won't have discovered so much. You also have to appreciate Walter's diligence with the research that he did for this book and how he stitches together Leonardo's life in a chronological yet otherwise categorical way. It must have been so hard for him to struggle through all the obscure references which would have been all over the timeline, sometimes containing exaggerated or even false claims, and then weave all these discrete evidences into an ingenious and coherent story such that the reader can almost apparate in that time and place where the author is playing with the characters. There's a strong desire now to actually see Florence and Milan, and Louvre as well. This book has also developed a better sense of Italian Renaissance in me, so it would be accurate to say that it's been both an edifying and an aesthetic read. Hoping to read another book by Walter!"

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Summary: A biography of da Vinci, from his illegitimate birth, his life long quest for patrons, his insatiable curiosity, his various artworks, and the notebooks, in which are revealed so much of the genius of da Vinci. This is a magnificent biography in every way. Isaacson delves deeply into the life, the notebooks, the travels, and the works of art of da Vinci and renders an account of the peculiar, dazzling, and flawed genius of Leonardo. This is a book you need to read in print. It is a heavy book because it is printed on high quality paper with ample, full-color Figures rendering the notebooks and artworks of Leonardo. A full-color timeline at the front of the book highlights the works of Leonardo, and the key events of and during his life. A theme that runs through this book is the insatiable and child-like of Leonardo, who wonders why the sky is blue (and arrived at a basically accurate explanation of this phenomenon) and wanted to describe the tongue of the woodpecker. He was fascinated with optics, from how the eye works to how light was refracted, and why distant objects appear different in color and distinctness from those closer up. He was an innovator in applying these insights in his use of perspective of his paintings. He did pioneering studies of human anatomy that, if published, would have advanced the understanding of anatomy a hundred years earlier. His fascination with hydraulics resulted in an accurate explanation of the closure of the heart's aortic valve. His notebooks contain speculations questioning a geocentric universe in advance of Copernicus. Leonardo was an . He not only was curious about everything, but he closely studied the objects of his interest, whether it was the play of light on his subjects, the proportions of the human body, consummately illustrated in his Vitruvian Man, the movements of the wings of a dragonfly, the contractions of the leg muscles of a horse, or the way water flowed in a river. Isaacson notes: ""Here's a test. All of us have looked at birds in flight, but have you ever stopped to look closely enough to see whether a bird moves its wing upward at the same speed as it flaps it down? Leonardo did...."" Leonardo had the ability to draw upon everything he knew with anything he did. This was one of the things that made him such a fascinating subject for Isaacson, who writes, ""I embarked on this book because Leonardo da Vinci is the ultimate example of the main theme of my previous biographies: how the ability to make connections across disciplines-arts and sciences, humanities and technology-is a key to innovation, imagination, and genius."" His study of light and optics shows up in his use of sfumato in painting, where objects are not defined by hard lines, but gradual shadings of tones into one another. He sees analogs between root and branch systems in plants and the human circulatory system. His anatomical studies culminate in the mysterious smile of Mona Lisa and his anatomical drawings are themselves works of art. Isaacson also traces the peculiar genius of Leonardo, who conceives of giant cross bows, flying machines, and engineering projects, all of which are never executed. He was a path-breaking scientist who never published the results of his studies. Thankfully, even after 500 years, we still have 7200 pages of his notebooks. A number of his paintings were never ""finished"" and even Mona Lisa was still in his studio when he died. He abandoned commissions that he never finished. He experimented with techniques of mural painting that were spectacular failures and have challenged preservation efforts ever since. Isaacson candidly discusses Leonardo's personal life without becoming lurid. He covers his illegitimacy, his ambivalent relationship with his father, and his homosexuality, including his relationship with his apprentice, Salai. He traces his lifelong quest for patrons, courting the various powerful families of Florence and Milan, and ending with King Francis I of France, who, legend has it, cradled the head of Leonardo in his death throes (a legend that has been questioned). The author concludes with lessons from Leonardo's life, some that run through this review. Even if you don't buy this book, I would encourage you to peruse these. The front cover jacket copy refers to Leonardo as ""history's most creative genius."" Isaacson's biography makes that case, and does so with exquisite writing, typography and graphic design. This one's a keeper!"
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Walter Isaacson is an excellent writer and a wonderful biographer whose characters come alive for me. I like his work far better than than the the books of the two other popular contemporary biographers I have read recently -- David McCullough and Ron Chernow (although I credit Chernow with opening my eyes to the coolness of Alexander Hamilton way before the musical). Isaacson has a way of getting to the core of what makes his subject interesting and then describing it in a way that also makes his subject human and that arouses the reader's empathy. It is commonly known that Leonardo was more than a great artist, that he also had scientific interests, some of which directly impacted his art (optics and anatomy) and others that were more remote (flying machines, hydrodynamics, geology, astronomy, military engineering, and the list goes on and on). Isaacson helps us to understand the breadth and depth of Leonardo's interests and how far ahead of his time Leonardo was, but also lets us feel that if only we could allow ourselves to be more curious and if we could focus our powers of observation a bit more, perhaps we could see the world in something close to the way that Leonardo saw it, even if we could not attain his level of insight and genius. There were other sides of Leonardo's personality with which I was unfamiliar before reading this book. I did not know that he was gay. I knew that he was left handed, but had not appreciated how this affected his art and aids us in identifying and understanding his work. I knew that he had courted favor from wealthy patrons, but had not appreciated how he was a man both in and out of society -- charming, witty, capable of some high level ass-kissing, but also disdainful of wealth and willing to walk away from money and opportunity for the sake of things that he found more interesting. I went away from this book with a renewal of the impression that I got from reading George Eliot's ""Romola"" -- that if I had to pick any other time and place to live than my life in the present, then my choice would certainly be Renaissance Florence."

I immediately requested it from my library and was number 8 or 9, and figured I might get it in March or April, but somehow I got it last week! I started reading right away, since I’m slow reading non fiction, then found the audiobook available through Scribd, read beautifully by Alfred Molina. It was a real treat to read along with him. I’ve always wondered about Leonardo, I knew he was the ultimate Renaissance Man who painted the Mona Lisa, but there is so much more. His boundless curiosity lead him to explore architecture, engineering, science and anatomical studies (including numerous human and animal dissections), and he made several discoveries that would be lost and rediscovered centuries later.

Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Just like Leonardo himself, this book jumps from topic to topic, location to location, science to art, from chapter to chapter - it's a glorious mess. Isaacson does a stellar job imposing as much order as possible, but it can be hard to get a firm grasp on Leonardo and his life at times. Because of how long ago it was, and the unreliability of older biographers, but also because of the huge variety of topics he tackled. It's absolutely fascinating. I loved reading about Leonardo as a child, and indeed there is something child-like about a guy who could obsess about why the sky was blue, or how a woodpecker's tongue worked. Leonardo left a ton of notes in his sketch books, written backwards (mirrored) - and they provide many insights into his mind, his mode of thinking, of observing the world. I've learnt: that my note-taking habits are to be praised, but perhaps I should think of moving them to a physical medium, instead of the impermanence of online. To be overly observant, always, of everything around me - not just looking at things as they are on the surface, and taking my book-learned knowledge at face value. To cherish, and follow, ""idle"" curiosity - it can lead to many valuable discoveries. A strong recommendation from my side."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Fascinating deep dive into da Vinci and his works. Isaacson writes his biographies as a series of sections within chapters and while I have always found that it slows down the narrative, I think for da Vinci it made the most sense. While this is a biography, most of the book focuses on his works and often goes through them one at a time. A great deal of attention is given to his notebooks, and honestly I found it beyond interesting. He was literally generations ahead of his time, but sadly most of what he discovered about things like anatomy had to be rediscovered by others because he did not care about publicizing his work. Overall a great read. And for fun - a great drinking game would be to take a drink every time the author uses the word ""sfumato"". You will likely die of liver disease before you finish the book."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"My second book from Isaacson and it's an incredible read. It provides a holistic overview of Leonardo's life with a key focus on his formative years, art, inventions and anatomical studies. There is also plenty of context given to the wider Renaissance period and meaningful links made with other notable figures from the period: Cesare Borgia, Michelangelo, Luca Pacioli, and the Medici family, to name but a few. There is also some discussion surrounding Leonardo's religious beliefs, sexuality and mental state, which add some fascinating dimensions to the read. A must-read for anyone interested in Leonardo's life or the wider Renaissance period in Europe."
Leonardo da Vinci,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I would not recommend the audiobook unless you are able to listen to it alongside viewing the PDF, which has over 100 reproductions of paintings and pages from da Vinci’s notebooks, with extensive referencing between the two. Apart from that the audiobook is a pleasure to listen to, Alfred Molina’s reading is spot on. The book itself is clearly the result of an extraordinary amount of research. But we get a lot of Isaacson’s opinions on matters like the authorship of various paintings or sketches, was it da Vinci or was it one of his students, who was better da Vinci or Michelangelo, et cetera. Given that he is a historian rather than an art historian you can’t help thinking it’s just some dude’s opinion. But his enthusiasm for da Vinci’s genius is infectious."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was an influential Dutch painter, one of the most outstanding representatives of post-impressionist painting. Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Zundert, a small Dutch village, on March 30, 1853. The son of a Calvinist pastor was a rebellious and withdrawn child. In 1869 he entered a local boarding school. At 16, Van Gogh went to The Hague to work with his uncle, who opened the branch of Galeria Goupil, an important company that sold works and books. After three years, he is sent to Brussels, where he spends two years. Then he goes to London, always at the service of the gallery. In 1875, van Gogh obtained his transfer to Paris, where he thought he could free himself from all his frustrations. However, in April 1876, after being upset with his clients, he was dismissed from the Goupil group. He goes to England, where he accepts the teacher position at a small-town elementary school. Then, in December, he goes to Etten the same year, where he meets his family, but his family relationships are complex; he only feels understood by Theo, his younger brother. Van Gogh becomes depressed, suffers repeated nervous breakdowns, and spends long periods of loneliness. Finally, in 1877 he got a job in a bookstore in Dordrecht until he decided to pursue his father's career. Then, he joins the Theological Seminary at the University of Amsterdam. Failing of lack of base, he entered the Evangelical School in Brussels. He takes the place of a missionary preacher in the coal mines of Borinage, Belgium. However, the contact with the workers' misery caused his first great spiritual crisis, accompanied by the loss of faith, and in 1879 he was dismissed. In 1880, Van Gogh went to Brussels, and with the money his brother sent him, he studied anatomy and perspective. After that, he spent his days drawing and moved in 1881 to The Hague, where he was welcomed by the painter Mauve. He paints watercolors where sailors, anglers, and peasants appear. He writes to his brother, ""I don't want to paint pictures, I want to paint life."" He makes numerous drawings and oil paintings. The following year he returns to his parent's house, where he spends his days reading and painting. In March 1885, his father died suddenly. In April of the same year, Van Gogh painted The Potato Eaters, characterized by dark tones. In January 1886, Van Gogh traveled to Antwerp, where he began studies at the local Academy. In February, he is welcomed in Paris by his brother Theo. This one is the painter's most pleasant time. He becomes familiar with the impressionists Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro. Later, he becomes friends with Gauguin. The influence of impressionist artists and the growing admiration for Oriental art led Van Gogh to develop his style. The artist takes the practice of building the figure utilizing separate brush strokes and solid and defined colors. Van Gogh painted 200 pictures in two years, including the Self-Portrait (1887) and Portrait of Père Tanguy (1887-1888). Post-Impressionism only appeared in 1910 when the critic and artist Roger Fry organized an exhibition entitled ""Manet and the Post-Impressionists."" The leading artists were Cézanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. In 1888, Van Gogh found himself in poor health and followed the advice of Toulouse-Lautrec, went to the countryside, and in February in Arles, painted outdoors. At the time, Van Gogh painted his most important works; there were more than 100 paintings, among them: View of Arles with Lilies (1888), Sunflowers (1888), where a single shade is valued through the light modulations and Bedroom in Arles ( 1888). Vincent van Gogh lived with Gauguin for a while, but the two artists always fought. There are reports that his mistress was involved with Gauguin, and when he finds out, he argues and attacks his friend with a razor. Sorry, cut off a piece of your ear and send it to Gauguin in an envelope. He is taken to the hospital, then goes home and paints the Self Portrait with the Cut Ear (1888). In May 1889, he asked his brother to admit him. He goes to the Hospital de Saint-Rémy-de-Provance and turns his room into a studio, producing over two hundred paintings and hundreds of drawings, including The Starry Night (1889). Theo asks Signac, a painter's friend, to visit him. Signac is impressed by Van Gogh's painting. So he took some friends to Theo's house to see Van Gogh's paintings. The Mercury of France newspaper praises the painter. An exhibition at the Brussels Gallery is organized, but the artist only sells The Red Vine (1888), the only one that would have sold during the painter's lifetime. Vincent van Gogh left Saint-Rémy in May 1890. He goes to Auvers, under the care of Dr. Gachet, who examines him and says that the situation is serious. He painted over 200 drawings and 40 paintings in the period, including Trigal with Crows (1890) and The Church in Auvers (1890). Van Gogh died practically anonymously after a tormented life that led him to isolation and finally to suicide. On July 27, Van Gogh goes out to the wheat field with a gun in his hand, and in the middle of the area, he shoots himself in the chest and is rescued, but he cannot resist. Fame came only after his death. However, much of its history is described in the 750 letters he wrote to his brother Theo, which showed a strong connection. Vincent van Gogh died in Auvers, France, on July 29, 1890. On the day of his death, in the attic of the Goupil Gallery in Paris, 700 paintings were heaped without a buyer."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm done and I'm happy. Wow. Wow. Wow. No words can express the magnitude of this man's work! Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris. He was deeply religious as a younger man and aspired to be a pastor, like his father. He became a teacher in England and then worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work . His palette then consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region's strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888. Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to deteriorate. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, something that often frustrated Van Gogh. They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of ""excessive tension,"" rapidly headed towards a crisis point. Deeply remorseful, he then cut off part of his own ear. This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals and swung between periods of inertia, depression and incredibly concentrated artistic activity. His work reflected the intense colours and strong light of the countryside around him. On May 9, 1889, he asked to be admitted to the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de Provence, a hospital for the mentally ill. In the year Van Gogh spent at the asylum he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings. Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo. On the advice of Pissarro, Theo had Vincent go to Auvers, just outside Paris. At first, Van Gogh felt relieved at Auvers, but toward the end of June he experienced fits of temper and often quarreled with Gachet. On July 27, 1890, he was severely injured by a gunshot and died, two days later, in the morning of July 29, 1890. Up to this day, it remains unclear whether he shot himself in a lonely field or whether he was murdered. The most comprehensive primary source for understanding Van Gogh is the collection of letters between him and his younger brother, art dealer Theo van Gogh. They lay the foundation for most of what is known about his thoughts and beliefs.Theo provided his brother with financial and emotional support. The brother's lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, is recorded in the hundreds of letters exchanged between 1872 and 1890. There are more than 600 from Vincent to Theo, and 40 from Theo to Vincent. Personally, I didn't necessarily enjoy the writing in this biography. I thought that the way in which the information on Van Gogh's life were presented, albeit chronologically, still left me confused. Walther's writing style is quite inaccessible and it's hard to follow along with his arguments since a lot of his train of thoughts are left hanging in thin air. It was quite frustrating to read since Van Gogh had such a fascinating and captivating life. Nonetheless, I had to give this biography such a high rating since it is to date one of the only books that contains Van Gogh's entire body of work in full color (781 paintings). I found it fascinating to see the different stages in Van Gogh's life and to how many different art styles he committed before finding his own. He started with painting in somber tones, mostly still lives, then studies of the working class. He even tried nude painting and painting busts. Personally, I tend to enjoy his portraits even more than his landscape paintings – but both are absolutely sublime, of course! Overall, this book is just such a gem and an invaluable treasure and I cannot wait to flip through these pages and look at Van Gogh's work for many years to come."

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I had read this book in a library, while I was looking up books about painters. I ended up reading two books about Vicent that time and this was one of them. I always had a soft spot in my heart for this painter. While it is true that I'm a lover of art, I find Vicent's paintings to be particularly moving. I respond to his art on a deeply personal level and I suppose that's as good as a reason as any to want to know more about him. I haven't purched this book yet and I'm not sure will I. Some time in the future, I plan to invest in a few books of the sort, but I think that can wait. This book is not a complete study of Vicent's life but it is a very interesting read. It did shed a new light on his life and revealed some facts that were unknown to me. It fooled my interest in his life. The quality of reproductions is satisfactory, but far from perfect. Although I'm not really an expert, it seemed to me that the colours on reproductions of oil paintings were a bit off. Illustration and sketches on the other hand were of high- quality. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Van Gogh or is interested in painting. It is well written, it contains interesting (albeit somewhat depressive and dark) information about his life. If you want to learn more about this fascinating man, you will do well to read this one. There were many layers to Vicent, he was a deeply ethical man and a great thinker. It is really tragic how most people think of him as that crazy guy who cut his ear off. He was a great painter, but his life story is noteworthy as well. His brave struggle for his art is something that is worth reading about. I for one plan to continue reading about Vicent."

Perhaps they’ll listen now.” (Don McLean, “Vincent.”) I have had this insane love for Vincent van Gogh’s work for as long as I can remember. It just screams, “Look at me. Feel me. This is life.” All the breathtaking color vividly expressing mood and emotion. All the heavily textured brush strokes that one could visually see, knowing that the physical touch would be even more. I type this as I sit outside with a freshly filled bird feeder located on my far right, visible out of the corner of one eye. I find myself randomly glancing over to take in the mostly winter birds mixed with a few early spring birds that are busy battling it out with a cold weather fluffed squirrel. I contemplate the view and can’t help but think of Vincent strolling out in the early morning, with his gear in hand, ready to find the perfect everyday scene that captures his physical eye at that exact right moment. The color palette he wants to use already in his mind’s eye, set to match the mood of the day before him. This book was everything it needed to be and then some. It was gorgeous, informative and I am so very happy to have it permanently placed on my nightstand in the top book spot. If you are a fan of Vincent’s art, I highly recommend it. I also recommend visiting any of his paintings in person (on my bucket list) and attending an immersive experience if one is close to you (I did that last summer). His work is something to behold, this book was amazing, and the planning of a tattoo of his art on my skin...well that last one is all mine. (Don McLean, “Vincent.”)"

For the 1st time, I could truly appreciate his use of dark tones, social themes and shades in his pieces, a result of his mental state. I have come out with utmost appreciation for his work and respect. I cannot forget some of his last words - ""I can't change the fact that my paintings don't sell. But the time will come when people will recognize that they are worth more than the value of the paints used in the picture."" Recommended as a collectible for a copy of all his works in color and a introductory monograph on the artist."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},I don't actually have this book. I just saw a bunch of Van Gogh paintings in person and tried to look at his complete paintings digitally and in print. Obviously a 5-star experience. My plan is to slowly look at more and more artists in some sort of organized way and get a sense for fine art. Let me know what other artists I should be checking out or if there's a good resource for it.
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"While it's nice to peruse a compendium of my favorite artist's work, there were two major problems with this work. The first is unfortunately inherent in van Gogh's work, and that is how printed facsimiles of his paintings never come close to the full register of color and sheer power of the originals. I was again and again taken by how his paintings, in this book, fail to really move me, while those same paintings in real life cause my breath to quicken and my heart to beat stronger, and I honestly feel better about humanity as a whole after seeing Vincent's work. But, on these pages? Ehhh. Still, that's not a reason to dock stars from the rating. I can hardly expect Taschen to include an original Van Gogh painting with each book, and even if they did it would probably put the retail price a biiiiiiiiit out of my range. My real problem with the book itself is another inherent problem, this one inherent to art books as a whole. I am simply bored to death of people telling me what Vincent van Gogh (or any other artist) was trying to achieve. This is an example of the interior writing, with the author here speaking of van Gogh's cornfield paintings. ""It was in order to offer the cornfield as a source of strength, as consolation in the despondency that inevitably accompanies suffering, that van Gogh painted his enclosed fields. For the time being, the dark horizon of sorrow is lost to view. The field and the horizon as metaphors of the simultaneity of comfort and grief as (when incorporated into paintings) central motifs in the pictures where van Gogh went furthest in locating paradox in spatial principles."" Wha? There is only one type of artist who would ever step back from a canvas and, with an air of satisfaction, pronounce, ""This painting is where I've gone the furthest in locating paradox in spatial principles."" That type of artist is known, to me, as, ""An Artist Who Needs A Smacking."" And yet the above example is but a small snippet, chosen at random. Such writing permeates the book, and is the chief reason why, about 20% of the way into the book, I began to skip large passages. Then, about 60% of the way into the book, I began to leap even larger passages. By the end of the book I was merely flipping through the pages, looking at the pretty pictures. But, for all that, the picture sure are pretty."

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"These books are an invaluable resource to anyone studying Van Gogh, because they truly carry every painting and many of the sketches and drawings that the prolific Van Gogh did in his brief career. They are arranged in chronological order and that made them very useful as I was reading The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh, which are fascinating. (I've reviewed that as well.) These are large format, very heavy books on excellent paper - 300 pages or so in each volume. There have been complaints about the color reproduction but I find that to be a problem in all art in printed form and felt that the very comprehensiveness of these books outweighed any disparities in the color, which seemed minor to me. The writing is useful, though I took some of their thinking about Van Gogh as just one opinion. A lot of what's said about the work of any artist, or any novelist for that matter, is just guesswork and informed opinion - but some of the insights in it were very useful. I read the second volume more carefully than the first and found their theory about the factors contributing to Van Gogh's suicide very interesting. They present the possibility that one of the factors was raising the value of his own work in order to help his beloved brother Theo in a tough financial time just after his child, named after Vincent, was born. He wrote a letter to Theo just before his death about how the value of an artist's work goes up so significantly after he dies and he had been very troubled by his dependence on Theo's generous support throughout his artistic life. Given Van Gogh's romantic nature, it's an interesting possibility, along with all the more familiar factors, like the pain and humiliation of his previous ""attacks."" So, interesting ideas and a comprehensive collection of Van Gogh's works - I'd recommend the set."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I truly admire the author's tremendous effort and great works on incorporating Vincent van Gogh's painting style and his life mainly based on the letters with his brother Theo chronically. It is a great dedication that the author relates Gogh's mind based on the letter to derive his evolving painting styles over his life. I'm a big fan of Gogh's paintings that I always try to find his paintings in every art museum I go so I'm already acknowledged somehow that Gogh's works were not widely recognized in his contemporary at all compared to his posthumous reputation. By quoting a lot of his letters throughout this book, the book stimulates the readers to view Vincent van Gogh as a person more than a famous Dutch painter in the 19th century who had been through financial, mental and professional hardship until he eventually committed suicide. After reading this book, I kinda feel loneliness at the same time in ""Starry Night Over the Rhone"" as it was the time when Gogh was living in France apart from his affable brother, Theo(The painting is painstakingly beautiful when you see it in Musee d'Orsay). The starlights reflecting the river looks extraordinarily marvelous in the lonely painter's eyes which might be just ordinary scenery to people around that area. I highly recommend this book to people who wants to know more thoroughly about Vincent van Gogh."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Vincent Van Gogh, a perfectionist without a doubt. For starters his story holds so much, everyone would know him as the Man who has a severed ear, but he’s so much more than that. His letters are the reason why you should start knowing him better, he’s a deliberate artist, him and his extraordinary mind, he would just pick up a brush and paint with no care in the world. His drawings knocks me off my feat every-time, his choice of colors and textures, astounding. He deserved so much, it saddens me to say that he died in vain, heres to a world where Van Gogh is appreciated and loved."

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Like anyone who has taken more than half a passing glance at visual art, I'd seen Van Gogh's most famous paintings many times and in many contexts over the years. He and Pulp Fiction kept the dorm room poster industry in business (at least back in the 90s when I was in college). And of course, variations of the story about his ear and his attendant mental illness are legendary, mythic almost. And I picked up a copy of his letters well over a decade ago after reading some quotes from it. It sat there unread, the past couple years accompanied by this two volume set I got at Mr. K's on store credit. I've been reading them alongside each other over the past month and a half or so (the letters have slowed down due to prepping to talk about Circe by Madeline Miller on a podcast, but I hope to finish them soon, I'm about 4/5ths through), and it is an illuminating and enjoyable experience. Aside from a couple of what appear to be bad edits and a contradiction between two sections, the biography/art criticism part of this was pretty good overall, and very good as table setting. But of course, you read this for the pictures, and they are fantastic. Now that I've read the extensive text, I doubt I'll revisit it other than to reference something, but having the context they provide, I'll be staring at the paintings often. I like the portraits and especially the landscapes and hospital paintings more than the still lifes with a couple exceptions. I can see why he's as influential as he is. Great stuff. Highly recommended!"

I've read that the newer edition of this book released by Taschen in 2001, cannot compare; it's a single volume and the art plates are very poor quality.

I found this book interesting for a number of reasons. Firstly his family background was discussed which gave a fuller picture of the artist, his training and the financial support he was given – which contrasted with the normal picture of an unloved, penniless madman. Secondly the book contained numerous examples of his works, many of which I thought were very good."

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"My husband and I recently went to one of those immersive Van Gogh experiences. I enjoyed it, but I realized how much I didn’t know about Van Gogh and his work. I borrowed this book from the library because it promised “The Complete Paintings,” and was surprised and pleased how much narrative it also included. I knew, I guess, that Van Gogh had struggled to find himself. I knew that he had tried to make it as an art dealer, as his brother Theo would do, but that didn’t work out. I didn’t know that Van Gogh’s father was a clergyman, nor that Vincent himself was intensely religious as a young man. He had gone as a preacher to a community of desperately poor coal miners in Belgium. That was also not to be his destiny, but for the rest of his life Vincent would have sympathy for the poor, and would go among the homes of the peasants, wearing simple, worn out clothes. I didn’t know that Vincent had several failed love affairs. He obsessively pursued his cousin Kee, and when she turned him down, he took up with a prostitute named Sien, who had children already. He lived with her, and wanted to marry her, but his family, being respectable and successful, was against it. And he could not support her. He asked Sien to give up her sex work, which she did, but he made nothing by painting, and the family was malnourished to the point of starvation. Reluctantly, he agreed to leave Sien, to devote himself full time to painting, and to live on the money that Theo would send him, for the rest of his life. He spent time in Holland, and Belgium, and Paris, trying to study painting, and then he moved to Arles, in the south of France, where he would paint his greatest works. I also didn’t know the role that Gaugin played in Van Gogh’s spiral downwards. Vincent bought a house, the yellow house, in Arles, with money inherited from his father’s death. Vincent imagined he could create a community of artists there, sharing ideas and encouraging each other. Gaugin would be the first guest at the yellow house. Van Gogh looked forward to his coming for months, preparing by decorating Gaugin’s room with sunflower paintings. Then Gaugin came, and he was all pissy, and didn’t want to be there anyway, and argued with Van Gogh, and before you know it, Van Gogh was in the asylum with depression. I also didn’t know how obsessively Van Gogh painted. He painted series of things. Back in Holland he painted landscapes with thatched cottages and windblown trees, peasants digging in their boat-like clogs, and their broad butts in the air, heads of peasant women with white caps and blotchy faces and bulbous noses, and still lifes with brown bottles and baskets of brown potatoes. Once Van Gogh moved to Arles it was like the light switched on. He began series of paintings of flowering trees, and then the golden wheatfields, and golden sunflowers, and golden straw hats, and the golden sun over everything. Not every painting was a masterpiece, but some of them, with their wiggly lines, and slabs of color, have so much energy in them, that I felt a rush of joy just looking at them. I am grateful for Van Gogh’s life and for his work. He was always an odd man, and never really fit in anywhere, but people who knew him recognized that his heart was generous and kind. He wished for a better world, and he believed somehow that his paintings would help to make it so, and amazingly, somehow, they really have."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is a thorough compilation of van Gogh's work, his techniques, influences, his ups and downs of self-doubt. A few notes worth sharing: van Gogh was influenced by Japanese prints on ""crinkly paper that was like crepe."" van Gogh focused on ""the light inherent in things"" not only ""light that came from the outside."" Many artists could relate with this quote: ""It is the excitement, the honesty of aresponse to Nature, that guides our hand; and if this excitement is often so strong that one works without noticing that one is working, if brushstrokes sometimes come thick and fast like words in a conversation or letter, then one ought not to forget that it has not always been like that and that there will be many a depressing day barren of inspiration in the future."""
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Very complete book. I like the chronological order of the pictures. I have not taken the time necessary to read the entire book, but I did examine all the pictures. I am glad I read a 'best of van Gogh' book first - by this same author/publisher: Vincent van Gogh, 1853-1890: vision and reality by Ingo F. Walther, Taschen. By reading the much shorter book first (with the 'best of' print collection), I felt I knew the van Gogh story good enough to appreciate this current in-depth book. Truthfully, I liked the size of the prints in the shorter book (Vincent van Gogh, 1853-1890). This current longer book had some of the best know paintings cross between pages, which I don't really like. The shorter book also had all the prints quite large consistently. Both books have great color."

Though I prefer reading about the man through his own letters, this has much information Vincent doesn't himself reveal. The book is broken down into the formative artist years (the first 30) and the last seven--with a catalog of his 871 paintings. I'm not sure I can agree with all of Metzger's insights about Vincent's personality, and he sets forth many. I only have two Van Gogh books now--this one and one of the letters one. They're sufficient to give one a good understanding of the man and the painter."

It puts to rest some of the well spread myths about Van Gogh. I'm a complete and utter fan of his works and the passion he put into each brush stroke. I sympathize with the fact that he had a mental illness and used his art to express himself. I never believed he killed himself, and this book brought validation to that thought."

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It does contain all of his paintings, mostly in color. The biography contained within this book is very helpful for understanding what is contained within it, but as a biography and analysis in and of itself, it is left wanting. Despite taking up a majority of the space on the roughly 700 pages within this book, much of the critique and analysis within feels very surface level, and moreover, it feels very reductive to many important elements of Vincent van Gogh's life and influences. In particular, Metzger's view on van Gogh's mental instability (and, one might suspect, his view on mental illness as a whole) seems rather misguided. Painstaking detail is given to create an image of van Gogh as a deeply troubled soul from the moment he is introduced, much is said on other contemporaries' impressions of his mental torment and his deeply conflicted nature. Despite this, Metzger seems to believe that it is possible to create a vision of van Gogh's personality, his views on the world, and indeed, his art, independent of the intense passion and resulting mental problems which seem to color every aspect of his life. The blithe manner with which he speaks to others' misinterpretation of van Gogh's oeuvre as ENTIRELY created from singular elements of madness or religiosity, or of his truly perplexing situation with mental health, while simultaneously demonstrating a profoundly incomplete reasoning for many things of his life and character due to their absence, is irony which is difficult to compare. I think in Metzger's attempt to shoo off the traditional misinformed manner in which people typically speak on van Gogh, he has instead created a more surface level analysis which occupies the other end of misinterpretation. It can be frustrating to read, because he seems to so nearly grasp the whole of van Gogh's person, certainly better than many others, but due to his preoccupation with avoiding this particular speculative element, he misses a forest for the trees. Van Gogh's work in general, in combination with his views on art, seems resistant to the notion of high art analysis and understanding that Metzger (and many others, I suspect) seek to employ, anyway. Van Gogh is one of the most popular figures in the art world not only due to his modern vision of what art could be, but indeed for his connection to the material world--to other people around him. To common people, as well as airs of the upper class. He seemed to have a true understanding of humanity--that we're all just little people, all alike in dignity. Many people espouse van Gogh as a visionary of what ""true art"" is, and I haven't a clue what true art is in a transcendent sense, but I know that van Gogh's utilization of art to represent beauty and life to the common person is certainly something that speaks to me."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book has completely changed my opinion on Vincent Van Gogh, and I am not entirely sure it is for the better. I am a big fan of these editions, which collect full-colour reproductions of an artist's work. Like most people, I knew a bit about Van Gogh going in and was particularly curious to learn more about his Japanese influences, which initially drew me to his work. Although I did find that, this book did have some significant problems. It almost seems necessary to review this book in two parts. The first half of the book is noticeably worse than the first. This point is mainly to do with the paintings themselves. Although I appreciated seeing Van Gogh's evolution as an artist from start to end, most of the beginning pictures are identical. I saw so many images of the same peasant woman that I thought I was going insane! Ultimately, I expected that from an anthology like this and did not let it impact my rating. What did influence my reading more was how disjointed the text and the images felt at the start. Although enlightening, Rainer Metzger's running commentary is more a biography of van Gogh than a reflection on his art. It is not until halfway through the book when Metzger begins to talk about the first picture. Even though the author does quickly catch up despite some repetition, the book feels poorly edited as the pictures do not correspond with the discussions. This leads to the first half feeling jarring, but the second is much better. For the most part, the text itself was well written. Metzger was deeply philosophical in parts and aimed to present a complete understanding of the man. Some art knowledge is definitely needed, however, and I think most readers, like myself, will struggle with parts of the text. Metzger is also often pretentious in the way art critics can be and often applies strong symbolism to simple paintings. It is a difficult balance to achieve, but I felt like the author was too focused on Van Gogh's eventual suicide, as if his entire life was an orchestra leading up to that climax. Indeed, it could have been, as I learnt the artist was not the simple mentally challenged man presented in modern media. Now, I am not even sure if he was mentally ill at all. Overall, I did enjoy this book. I was still frustrated in parts, however. It has me wanting to read van Gogh's letters more than revisit his paintings. I would recommend it to anyone with interest in the artist's work."

Very dense in analysis of each painting and era of Van Gogh's work and life. I read it bit by bit, chapter by chapter. However, I enjoyed looking at each painting with the analysis to refer to it. This is not a simplistic view of Van Gogh's work and life, and I also enjoyed the nuances that the author provided to understand the man better. Not a ""crazy"" genius, but a troubled and persistent, talented man who devoted his life to his work despite poverty and rejection. Fascinating. I saw the ""Interactive Van Gogh"" exhibit in 2021, a ""pop video"" compared to this serious tome. Many of the illustration plates in the book were black/white, a disappointment. However, his major works and in color and vivid as always. Encyclopedic and worthy read for Van Gogh fans."
Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'll give it all the stars because the quality of the photos is great. The text is good but some parts are difficult to get through, and of course I was annoyed at how they talked about an specific period and the paintings relating to it are 100+ pages forward, but it does catch up after the second half and the information it gives is pretty interesting. There's also a chronology with some photographs at the end, and the index of names and paintings is really useful. Note: This is the hugest book I've ever read, it's pretty heavy and I alternated between reading it laid out on the table and on my bed, it also took me forever because I went back and forth a lot, if you only look at the pictures it'd take a lot less time."

Each labelled and printed clearly, this book is not only fascinating but aesthetically pleasing.

Vincent Van Gogh: The Complete Paintings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203805.Vincent_Van_Gogh/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"ah, the enigmatic Van Gogh - the man in all his raw sadness, emotion and, well, dramatic nature. he has always been amongst one of my favourite artists when it comes to pre-19th century. this was gifted to me as a birthday present a few years ago - and i must admit, the insight on his stories behind each work of art is far more interesting than the art itself. what's so significant about Van Gogh is not his art, really. (to me at least; he's just like any, 'coming-of-age' impressionist artist who thought he was breaking the rules and doing something completely revolutionary because he wasn't the absolute best at realism). don't get me wrong, i absolutely love his works and think they're beautiful, just as most people do, but not so revolutionary as to be the reason why he is so profound and considered one of the, if not , most famous painters in history. i think him, among all of my favourite artists, are so cool to me because of their personality (such as khalo, basquiat, hiroshige, etc). with this complete guide, it separates the art from the artists and it's only then when you're able to see correlation from what he was going through at the moment translate to his art. take his peasant studies, from 1881 to 1885 for one. as he began his career in art, yet to travel to the glamorous (yet proven to be toxic) art city of paris, his focus was grounded and earthed to his own origins. painting the regulars and peasants that were just like him. but alas, as he grew slightly more delusional and, well, ill, his art grew more and more impressionist - not to the same extent as picasso, but it was so interesting to see as you progress through the guide. this has definitely allowed me to appreciate this rather complex and bizzare, sad lonely guy from the 18th century and find some inspiration and hope to continue doing what i like doing. if a broke dude with one ear can do it, so can you."

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is one of those books where you walk into a room, finger on page, and yell ‘Did you know that Cherry Coke is full of dead insects!?’ at someone chopping onions, before ambling away again. It is a very charming and anecdotal book, in which Victoria Finlay racks up the air-miles trying to research the history of paints and dyes and colourings from across the spectrum. It is, as she points out, quite strange to think that electromagnetic waves can have a frequency ranging from radiowaves (which sometimes have more than ten kilometres between them) to cosmic waves (which can be less than a billionth of a millimetre); and yet humans can only detect a tiny span of this phenomenon, specifically wavelengths between 0.00038 and 0.00075 millimetres. This minuscule range of electromagnetism gives us all the colours of the rainbow – which makes you wonder how dazzling the world looks to other animals with different senses. If you approach this book looking for hard science or indeed careful history, you might be disappointed. Finlay's mode is excitable curiosity (sometimes buttressed by flights of speculation: ‘this might have meant’, ‘I like to think that…’), not sober authority. The best way to read it is as a personal travelogue, and indeed the book works best, perhaps, as travel literature. She somehow managed to get into Afghanistan (the source of almost all the world's ultramarine) in 2000 and 2001, and her descriptions of these journeys are astutely observed and very real: you get an impression of her as a good traveller and a good journalist, which is slightly lost in sections dominated by her historical research. Nevertheless, as a broad introduction to the subject, it's hard to imagine anyone could read this without learning something new and bizarre in Finlay's explorations of urinating cows, Mexican sea snails, Indian weeds, Afghan miners, Aboriginal Dreaming and eighteenth-century art. Her bibliography is packed with more detailed further reading, and she herself is full of enthusiasm and overall great company."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The disclaimers ""I imagine"", ""perhaps"", ""possibly"", ""it could be that"" appear in this NON-FICTION book far more times than they should. While I liked the content of about three-quarters of the book, it infuriated me at times when the author would suddenly start presenting the material through the eyes of a character, ""imagining"" their experiences, travels, and accomplishments. This first rears its head around page 81, when the tone of her book changes to speculate about an imaginary Corinthian artist. I quote... ""But what if she became tired of using just one variety of paint material? Perhaps, I thought, she may have tried out new blacks and browns. Would she, given the chance to try out charcoal's successors, have preferred lead pencils or India ink? Would she have dyed her clothes deepest black, or was it only in the palest of classical robes that she wanted to be seen? And if her boyfriend ever returned to Greece between voyages, would she have used her new knowledge of pigments to decorate her own face for the occasion? I imagined our heroine experimenting idly with mascaras and liners."" At this point, I threw the book across the room. WHAT THE HELL. It's mean to be a scholarly book about color... and I'm reading a bullshit paragraph leading me into speculation about ""this Corinthian woman's"" dating and make-up? I felt the same way about her handling of the character of Martinengo in the ""Orange"" chapter. On one two page spread, I think I counted ""I imagine"", ""perhaps"", ""possibly"", ""if"", about ten or twelve times. This is an irresponsibly stupid way to write nonfiction. Two stars (and I never want to read anything else by her)."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Having previously read Victoria Finlay's Buried Treasure: Travels Through The Jewellery Box, and enjoying that a lot, I was looking forward to what I expected to be a similar book on colour. This was no disappointment. Finlay pulls together a book about colour - primarily dyes, paints & pigments - arranged in chapters of colour (Ochre, Black & Brown, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) and within each skips about a bit with some travel, some history, some science (lite), some modern usage etc, but all focussed around that colour. Other readers were put off that the travel aspects, or the non-scientific content, or the sometimes biographic content, but for me I was fine with the balance. I suspect without aspects of all these it would be a more impersonal, scientific book which would likely interest me less. Prussian blue, ultramarine, cadmium red, Indian yellow, malachite green, cobalt,burnt sienna, Chartres blue Flemish white and cochineal red... for me these all conjure up mystical, old world colours I know almost nothing about, although the names are familiar enough. Finlay researches historic documentation, explores, visiting locations where possible, talks to people. She covers a lot of ground (my shelves are the country list of where she visited), went to a bunch of interesting places. She references artists, artworks, takes note from historic forgers, talks to modern artists using historic materials. She explores the many paints and pigments that are dangerous (poisonous or carcinogenic) and those that were secret or 'lost' and talks to people who have rediscovered those secrets. Wile the book runs to almost 500 pages (although around 100 are bibliography, notes & index), it could probably have been 50-75 pages shorter by the I was finished. After Ochre, Black & white and working through Roy G. Biv, I felt violet was a bit of a drag... If sort-of-science, anecdotes, travels and exploration, research and history all mixed up peak your interest, then I would recommend both this and (in fact, I liked Buried Treasure a little more). 4 stars"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"You can approach colours in a thousand different ways: purely visual, of course, but also emotional, aesthetic, chemical, and so on. But behind the colours of objects and works of art there is also a whole material production process of pigments and dyes, and this is related to trade networks and often also cultivation processes. If this book by Victoria Finlay taught me anything, it is that the materials for making dyes were often based on a specific local economy, which in general was kept very shielded: the recipe for the production of certain dyes often remained a secret for generations, and the book is full of references to monopolies on raw materials for those pigments and paints that have been maintained for centuries. At the same time, this whole traditional craft was accompanied by an enormous network of trade, certainly of those raw materials. For example, I learned that materials such as malachite and others were at least as valuable and expensive as spices, and often followed the same trade routes: from China and the Middle East to Europe and later America. Or from the Middle East to China: with cobalt, for example, which was mainly mined in Persia, and exported to China where it became the secret ingredient for the beautiful Chinese porcelain. And of course, it is all the more striking that when it comes to the production of synthetic paints and dyes, the reverse traffic routes suddenly arise. Because that chemical discovery, usually the petrochemical treatment of coal tar, was made in the West, in Europe and the United States, just after the middle of the 19th century. Finlay zooms in on this a little less, but it is clear that these synthetic paints pushed the old, traditional dyes out of the market, and therefore also destroyed the local economies based on them. It is a part of the ""Great Divergence"" process that usually remains underexposed. And it also underlines that the Western dominance chronologically should certainly not be situated too early. Maybe Finlay's book is not a work of reference. At times it is too much of a travelogue, a search for the remote areas where the basic products for traditional dyes could be found. But it surely is worth the prize of a very interesting pioneering study."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I’m always on my guard when I start reading a ""commodity history"". In many cases this is an endless accumulation of facts and anecdotes, often unsystematic and - what is worse - without critical screening. I had bad experiences with Mark Kurlansky's books (especially the one about Salt, Salt: A World History). But this seems to me of a different kind. Obviously this is not a science book, and Finlay is the first to admit. All in all, this is a mixed alternation of scientific information, personal travel stories, anecdotes, and even historical fiction. I only have a problem with the latter, for example when she imagines how a Jew, a violin maker expelled from Spain, roams Europe in the late 15th century in search of orange-coloured varnish. But otherwise this book stands for a very pleasant and informative read with usually also the necessary critical sense. Finlay opens up the wonderful world of colours to such an extent that from now on you can no longer look at the colour texture of objects with a blank mind: there is always a sometimes very surprising history behind it. Finlay focusses on traditional and artisanal dyes and fabrics: namely those that were extracted from pigments of plants, animals, minerals or ordinary soil, often after a very intensive process that also regularly involved rotting. It is a wonderful world of secret recipes, carefully shielded monopolies and sometimes intense trade over thousands of kilometres. Apparently, this whole machinery came to an end around the middle of the 19th century, quite suddenly, with the discovery of synthetic dyes, usually extracted from coal tar. They were so successful, and so much cheaper, that they almost wiped traditional paints off the map, in a way that many of the recipes just disappeared. They are now being rediscovered little by little, and that also Finlay zooms in on. In short, this is a very informative book, which actually focuses more on dye than on colour, although the latter determines the content of the book, divided in about 10 defining colours. I have learned a lot from it. The only major flaw I see is the lack of illustrations, at least in the edition I had. There is a small colour section, but that is more than insufficient. To say it with a pun: this book really screams for colour!"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Funny story with this book - got to page 112 and discovered that pages 113 to 146 were missing! Thankfully, Random House (publisher) came to the rescue and sent me a replacement copy. Until it came I was in suspense about how ladies used to poison themselves (by accident) with white cosmetics that were made from lead. This book was interesting not only for the information about colors, but also for the author's travels. She went to great lengths to get to the source of some colors, and along the way educates the reader about old customs and cultures. Fascinating book that will fill your head with lots of information that will seem useless unless you appear on Jeopardy some day. It made me look at everything around me a little more attentively, though, really noticing the color (Is that blue, indigo or violet?) and thinking about where that color source may have been aquired."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I remember when I was a child getting a box of paints in small tubes. I was fascinated by the names of the colours, words I had never heard of before - vermillion, magenta, aquamarine, cochineal, carmine. They might have been only shades of orange, purple, blue and red, but those exotic names gave those paints just a little more magic. Didn't do much for my art work, but never mind. Victoria Finlay would appear to have had a similar early interest in colour when her father took her to Chartres Cathedral. She noticed the beauty of the stained glass window crafted some 800 years ago, only to be gob smacked when her father told her that no one actually knows how to make that beautiful blue in the window anymore. And so began her interest in discovering where colours come from and ultimately this book. Part travelogue, part science text, part art history, part general history, the author has brought together a huge number and variety of facts and experiences and people into this rather large book of 440 pages, not including bibliography, notes and index which together run to another 60 pages! It could be very easy to have complete confusion in amalgamating all this material into a readable book. Probably the only way to do it with a subject such is colour is to organise it by colour. So she starts at the beginning with the colour of the earth - ochre - the first colour used for art and decoration. She goes to Australia, to an Aborigine community where ochre has been used continuously for 40,000 years. Imagine. She then moves onto black and brown made from soot, coal, fish excretions, graphite rock, wasps, as well as giving us snippets about mummification and the history of printing. The next chapter, white, is mostly about lead which was used to make white paint, and especially make-up resulting in the early and painful deaths of many fashionable ladies. Following the colours of the rainbow, the next seven chapters take us all over the world. From cochineal bugs on cactus plants in Chile (red), to Stradivarius violins in Cremona (orange), to urine gathering in India and wars over saffron (yellow), to exploring caves in China (green), visiting the Bamiyan Buddhas not long before they were blown up (blue), harvesting indigo plants in India and Mexico (indigo) and going to Lebanon to search for the source of the power of purple in ancient Rome and Egypt (violet). And these are only a few of the stories that the author crams into her book. If there is any criticism of the book it is perhaps that there is too much information, too many stories and adventures, making it hard to catagorise exactly what type of book it is. I would say, quite simply, it is a personal journey of a subject close to her heart that she wants to share with as many people as possible. It is an absolute treasure trove of action and inquiry and I learnt so much about all sorts of stuff! So glad I picked this book up from the shelf of a second hand book shop!"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Having an affinity for all things color, I was attracted to the cover of Color: A Natural History of the Palette while visiting the Met one afternoon about a year ago. I bought it and have been reading it for the past year. I'm sad to say that I found the cover to be the best part of this book. The book wasn't , but it also was nowhere near great. Finlay sets about the task of researching the origins of the pigments of the paintbox: Ochre, Black & Brown, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo & Violet. For each color, she researches the historical beginnings of the colors, specifically trying to illuminate why each color is named the way it is (eg, Tyrian Purple, Indian Yellow, etc.). She does this by trekking across the globe to the points of interest in hopes of discovering the histories (and, sometimes, secrets) of the colors from the indigenous people who, in some cases, still use the time-honored traditions. In some regards this book elaborates upon colors. In some regards this book is a travelogue. In yet other regards this book is part imagination: when Finlay is unable to find hard and fast facts about her subject, she will often say, ""I imagine [this to be true]..."" I think, if I could, I would rate this book 2.5 stars. It is mildly interesting but, perhaps, a bit too long."

And yet, it fell flat... I was expecting to read more of a history book, but it turned out to be a travelogue/memoir, and a tad too self-involved for my tastes.

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"LOVE me a book where I can pick a chapter and read up on what's been taunting my mind - thus I love anthologies and various other collections. in Color, I found a fantastic historical recounting of the who/where/why/what of much of our commonly accepted color palette. And that alone means something, because there is a surprisingly low ratio of 'general citizens' who knows REALLY what color is about, how it's made, how we wrestled/negotiated/bullied our ways into being enjoyers/purveyors of it. Lot's of lessons to be learned...."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I’d call this a travelogue on the origin of pigments and dyes of each rainbow color, and, I believe, the only book to really tackle the history of color. This book had been on my radar a while, but I had decided not to read it, yet a class on color finally compelled me to read it. Through it I’ve come to appreciate just how complex getting pigment mix with a medium of the right consistency and translucency to stick to a surface and dry without fading or changing color over time or to dissolve in water to dye cloth, and again, to stick and not fade. At times the author’s hunt for colors, such as for ochre in Australia or violet in Tyre, that start with all the drama of quest for unknown secrets, fizzle because the secrets remain unknown in the end. The origin and history of each color is presented here is interesting but feels incomplete as I would prefer a more broad history rather than the in-depth travel stories presented which leaves me with mixed feelings about this book."

It saved the best colors for last - indigo, from the indigo plant, and violet, from sea snail tears! There was an interesting balance, maybe unsuccessful, between the author trying to respect indigenous cultures or protected places, and finding the information anyways by reading books published in a less respectful time, or sneaking by guards. She also has a habit to claim things as “mine” - my pilgrims, my mines, my snails, etc - when they are obviously not hers at all. Besides those small annoyances, it was really interesting learn about the different pigments or dyes, and the writing style made it much more readable than if it was more textbook, less travelogue. It seemed she reverted to travelogue style narration when she had less historical information to go on, which sometimes made those sections longer. There was also a scant amount of photographs included, and there was much google image searching while reading this book. I recommend if you’re a fan of all things colorful, learning where the names on your paint tubes came from, or natural history."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In an impressive mix of history, science and travelogue. Ms. Finlay shares with her readers the results of her worldwide search for the pigments and dyes and that humankind has used over the ages. Each color (including black and white) is represented in a separate section, where she weaves stories of fictional and real-life people into her research with entertaining results. From Australian sacred ochers to Phoenician royal purple; from Incan reds to Chinese imperial greens - this book literally covers a rainbow of topics. The narrative thread is spider-silk thin for most of the book, and occasionally the reader is overwhelmed with the amount of information presented; but the overarching theme of the discovery and use of color is carried well throughout. Not only is this book accessible to the general reader, there is considerable scholarship in its pages. The bibliography covers 6 pages, with the notes section (broken down by chapter) another 13. She also includes a list of illustrations, credits and an index. I found myself filling a notecard with my comments, as well as noting some Further Reading references. Recommended to anyone with an interest in the artistic side of history and science."

Instead of paints, I have used Prismacolor art pencils.

And although I'm not primarily a nonfiction reader, this time it had nothing to do with the book itself or really nothing to do with the quality of the book. The quality was awesome. Finlay's writing was engaging and humorous and her journeys around the world to some of the most random and strange in an out of the way sort of places to discover the history of color were enlightening, educating and very entertaining. The reason it took me so long to get through the book is because it's just crammed with information, variety of information, from historical to cultural, that it takes a brain some time to process. Color is something that surrounds us on daily basis and yet receives barely a thought outside of matching, but after reading this book you won't look at it the same way again. In a way this was like taking a terrific class, because learning should optimally change the way we see the world. Interesting, clever, endlessly fascinating, this was a great read. Highly recommended."

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I've always been fascinated about the origins of colour, and in Color - A Natural History of the Palette, author Victoria Finlay travels the world in her search for the origin and birthplace of colors and dyes. I wasn't interested in the author's personal travelogue, so I initially had the intention of skipping over any boring parts and jumping straight to the facts about the colours which are conveniently broken down into the following chapter headings: 1. Ochre 2. Black and Brown 3. White 4. Red 5. Orange 6. Yellow 7. Green 8. Blue 9. Indigo 10. Violet What I found surprising was that there were no boring bits! Finlay has managed to keep herself out of the book for the most part, and the stories that were included were historically relevant to the colour being discussed and I didn't end up skipping a single paragraph. Finlay's passion for color and dyes are clear early on, but far from boring the reader her enthusiasm is infectious and I found myself becoming quite excited when she found her first indigo plant or saw a purple field of saffron crocus (used for the color yellow) for the first time. was made from the blood of the Cochineal insect, which lives on a cactus leaf The colour was made from saffron, harvested from the saffron crocus flower, however only 3 strands of saffron are collected from each flower. In 1775, arsenic was used to create a color called . It took until 1880 for people to realise that the wallpapers and paints using this green (and other paints containing arsenic) were killing people and making others very sick. e.g. a cat had become covered with pustules after being locked in a green room. is the colour that has been most legislated about over the longest time in history. has been a regal colour for centuries and one form of purple was made from shellfish and worn by emperors of Ancient Rome. Finlay writes that those who wore it ""probably left a cloud of garlicky, fishy smells in their wake,"" and that perhaps it was the ""scent of power"" at the time. What a thought! I learned so much about the history of colour, dyes, art, art forgery, culture, events in history and trade across many countries and different time periods in the world's history. Everything from a secret green used on ancient Chinese porcelain to the colour blue used to dye English police uniforms in the 1960s was covered, all of which I found fascinating and easy to digest in Finlay's conversational writing style. I thoroughly recommend to readers who enjoy art, culture, history, non fiction and have a natural curiosity about the colours around us; great for trivia nights too!"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is an impressive book with an innocuous title. The folio edition is as you would expect impressively bound and comes with its own box sleeve. However the contents are the same as the other editions just in a more impressive binding (I was lucky to pick this us second hand, there is no way I could afford such a book brand new ) the book after a short introduction to colours how they were incentivised and discovered then breaks up in to a number of chapters ingeniously named after a specific colour. These chapters cover a colour, it's source and in some cases discovery and where it was used. In many cases it can be seen that not only socially where these colour important but also financially and politically. As a result the book fires off ideas and other erasing suggestions all over the place to looking up the impressionist painters to discovering archeological cave paintings. The book is a fascinating read which I will admit I would not have normally gone for but I am very pleased I did (and on a side note any folio book is worth owning purely for the quality and sheer beauty of the binding )"

It wasn't that the book was boring... it was more like the structure held me back. The prose was well written, but the chapters were long and meandering. It's primarily a travel memoir arranged by colors in an artists palette rather than chronologically with bits of history and science mixed into descriptions of modern visits to museums and conversations with fascinating people. I found myself not wanting to start a new chapter unless I had time to finish. The anecdotes are memorable (even if I don't believe the part about finding the tiny piece of ochre). I enjoyed the part linking Michaelangelo to Afghanistan. It was entertaining. The book jumps from Australian First Nations art to Mount Vernon. Did Caesar smell funny? Why are pencils yellow? There are accounts of artwork that faded over time interspersed with techniques to produce the materials being discussed. It's definitely not a book for everyone, but I'll probably end up buying it."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I really liked this book, and I checked it out from the library but I'm going to buy it. I didn't mind the format or the fact that she spoke about her modern-day expeditions for the colors. According to the Torah, Gold told Moses to tell the Israelites to make ""fringes on the borders of their garments and put upon the fringe of each corner a thread of blue."" The Talmud went farther to specify that the blue had to come from a sea creature that had a shell. The shawl and fringe remind Jewish men of their responsibilities. The process to create this blue has been lost and rediscovered, many times over. between 1913 and 1980, all experiments done revealed purple, not blue, and usually involved the wrong sea creature. Then in 1980 an chemist called Otto Elsner who experimented with woad dyes noticed something extraordinary, that dying on a sunny day came out blue, while on cloudy days it was purple. This however did not solve the problem of how the Ancients made the pigment into a dye. ""The Israelites sent him a vial of pigment from and some wool. He was excited by the opportunity to test his theory that if Tyrian purple contains indigo, then perhaps, like woad and indigo, it needs to have the oxygen removed from the vat before it can become a dye. And what more convenient ingredient for achieving this than the rotting meat of the mollusk (which would cause the bacteria to putrefy and use up the oxygen)?"" He added some pickled cockles, which are similar to the murex that had supplied the pigment, after he washed off the vinegar. His solution turned from purple to green, and ""the first time he dipped a cloth into the liquor it turned purple. But later he found that if the dissolved greenish liquor was exposed to light, any cloth he put into it turned green and then - in the air - turned blue. This process has the theological neatness of embracing something holy, born of light. and like the blue thread, was on the fringe of the garment and metaphorically on the fringe of what is allowed in Jewish traditions. The Tyrian blue is one of the least kosher colors; Shellfish are as anathema to Jews as pork. and then here are some other little tidbits: *the first artist was a Corinthian woman *ochre is the oldest color, in all its variations *pencils were painted yellow to imitate the Chinese Manchu robes *Joseph Lovibond invented the first system to judge the quality of beer by comparing it against shades of brown stained glass *after the 18th century, brown ink was made from sepia, the dark liquor secreted by cuttlefish when they are afraid *Red was originally made from the blood of cochineal bugs, found on cacti *In the production of red in the 17th century, alum was the agent that gave the dye its teeth. it's rumored that King Henry VIII of England only married Ann of Cleves to get his hands on her alum *Turkish Miniatures were actually named after the orange that was prevalent *Saffron is really tricky to harvest. The romantic Spanish do not grow very much and they deal with the mice by smoking them out, while in Iran, they are killed with motorcycle smoke *Cleopatra used to take a saffron bath before inviting a man to her boudoir *In China, green porcelain, or , pronounced ""mee-ser"" was a big secret reserved for the wealthy and holy. it was admired for its unusual and rare beauty. the color would crackle slightly on the surface, making it perfectly imperfect *Green wallpaper was made with arsenic, and might have led to the premature death of Napolean at St. Helena *Green cloth was a sign of wealth in Robin Hood's time, so the fact that his garb was green was another example of stealing from the rich to give to the poor *Cennino's third green was often referred to as van Eyck green because he used it so well, especially in . This painting may be an allegory to sexual abuse rather than a celebration of marital bliss *Blue is made from Lapis Lazuli, which is a rock that contains speckles of iron pyrite, fool's gold, and is mined in Afghanistan *John Herschel invented the ""blueprint"" in 1842 *woad was used to make Indigo dye in the time of England's Braveheart, and was used to paint the warriors. it was also an extraordinary astringent, so they were also setting up a primitive field hospital while they were bathing in vats of woad *it was Newton that added orange and indigo to the spectrum. he decided there would be seven colors, because seven was a divine number. at the time there were only seven known planets, seven days of the week, seven musical notes. The Chinese use the number five; five elements, five tastes, five musical notes, and five colors: black, white, red, yellow and blue *In Hindu India, blue is often a lucky color, the color of Krishna, the god who dances around the world making both love and fun *As recently as 1952, Violet (or more like Mauve) was a color of mourning. when King George VI died in '52, ""black and mauve knickers were solemnly placed in haberdashers' windows"" *Phoenicians from Lebanon arrived from the Arabian peninsula in the third millennium B.C. Their name derives from the Greed word for Purple, .

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I love color. I've often said that I get the same pleasure out of looking at color that my friends seem to get from listening to music. It's a visceral feeling of joy that I can't describe particularly well with words. Also, since I'm a painter, this book has all the makings of a seven star review. Yet you notice it's only four stars, what gives? Okay here's the deal. When the subtitle of your book is ""A Natural History of the Palette,"" that implies history, as in truth (or the best we can make of it). Non-fiction. For the most part this is how the book is written, there are great stories about pigments and their origins, HOWEVER, there are several dozen little bits snuck into the text that all start, ""I like to imagine that..."" Well, guess what lady, I don't want to know about how you IMAGINE historical events to have played out. It's often not clear when we emerge back from imagination-land and back into facts, so now my brain is mishmashing true things with what Victoria Finlay wishes were true. As a somewhat sidenote, this is what I don't like about historical fiction, it generally results in me at a party disclosing some mindboggling facts about something I read, only to realize later when my ass (or brain, rather) is being handed to me on a plate, that it's not true and I had conflated the ""historical"" with the ""fiction"". All in all, I still would recommend this book to people who are interested in this topic, I just wish it never strayed from the already interesting stories about the origin of pigments/dyes."

The funny thing is, much of the history is lost or inaccessible. She goes to Australia and decides not to try to find out more about the Aboriginal spiritual meanings of ochre out of respect for the culture. Many times she goes to a place only to be disappointed to find nothing left or even--as in the case of Indian Yellow--a wild goose chase resulting from a story in a newspaper. The book seems as much about how much of our history is missing; I don't know many books either that embrace so many failings. While it is more like our own quests for understanding and finding of knowledge, it's hard not to want a published book to be the example of success. The interweaving of culture and history and color is good and even sometimes great. One of my favorite descriptions is the visit to the Afghanistan lapis lazuri mines; perhaps because this is one of the colors I have actually heard of combined with the area's standout against the Taliban. Yet, I kept comparing her to Simon Schama and finding her ability to make the history emotional relevant for me sub par."

I, like probably half the population in the world didn't bother to ponder about origins of colors let alone their history. They just magically appeared in my life in preschool and I took them for granted ever since. Then, I came across this book with the blurb mentioning that one of the common ingredient used in red dyes is the blood of thousands of insects. So, with my curiosity peaked, I began to read. 2. This book looks at vibrant colors of everyday objects (reds, yellows, blue, purples, and greens to name a few) that have complex and fascinating histories as well as reasoning for their uses. Even the processes involved in making the dyes and hues is interesting to read about. 3. I appreciate all the work Finlay put in through her research and travels to find out about the roots, customs and cultures of the colors. It has given me an appreciation of paints and pigments while educating me on the meanings behind them."

From the natural agents as well as the ancient recipes. And so she starts with The Paintbox - and with the 13th-century book by Cennino D'Andrea Cennini which revealed the trade secrets of a professional painter from preparing the canvas to copying a master drawing to making imitation blue pigments and more. It was even an inspiration for some art forgers. History of the changes in the painting industry as some professionals took - in some people's minds - too long preparing the paints and not enough time actually painting their commissions. The eventual elimination of 'colormen'. The development of new colors as well as discovering that some paintings have faded and what was described as a brilliant splash of red has faded to a muted pink. And so it goes and if the book continued along this line, it would have been a great deal more difficult to continue. But it didn't. And so the travel, history and stories really began. Ochre - off we go to Australia where painting with red, white, black and brown ochre are still part of the Aboriginal culture and life. Black/Brown - off to Europe, Asia and the Americas to find the blackest black and earthy brown as well as pencils, charcoal, and ink. Battles over control of the logwood stands. White - in Europe, China and Indonesia. The toxicity of the white lead with so many deaths in the name of pale beauty. Red - South America, Persia and Spain. Orange - Italy and Turkey. Yellow - India, Southeast Asia and Iran, Green - China, England, the US and Persia. Blue - Afghanistan (and yes, she was able to get a visa allowing her into the country amidst Taliban rule) Indigo - India, West Indies, Mexico and North Africa. Violet - Lebanon and Mexico And we end with a visit with the owner of Pantone, the color standard company for most of the world. Every chapter is filled with histories of the color as well as it's uses - be it painting or dying or both and more - stories of her adventures in attempting to find how the color may have actually looked when it was an ancient recipe. Some raw examples - like Indian yellow or a white ochre - exist only in a museum or some fortunate artist's hand. What was the shade of green for imperial Chinese porcelain? The mysterious stain that Stradivarius used on his masterpiece violins? Colors that don't exist anymore because no one knows how to make it anymore like the brilliant blue glass in Chartres Cathedral. Murex snails that were almost driven into extinction in Lebanon and Mexico for their rich purple. And the people she met along the way. I don't recall why I added this book to my To-Read list but managed to get a copy from the public library and I am glad I did. The writing flows and although massive amounts of information is stuffed into every chapter, I never felt overwhelmed. I wish I could have seen half of the places she traveled to. I also have to admit looking at a crowd of people in a different way. Seeing the bright and crisp colors of our clothes along with the dependable whites, browns, grays and blacks. With the introduction of synthetic coloring products - from artists' oils, acrylics and watercolors to dyes and color additives to our food - wearing a rainbow is no longer in the hands of the wealthy who could afford the extravagant costs of importing those few ounces of a fluid/stone more precious and rare than even gold was."

I made sure that it was okay that I was ""ruining"" the librarian's display, and she of course told me I was welcome to check out the book. On her very first page, she recounts the story of when she was taken to Chartres Cathedral as a child and being fascinated by the light streaming through the gorgeous stained glass windows. Her father told her then that the knowledge to make the blue in that stained glass had been lost to history, and she was utterly gobsmacked that such a thing could happen (spoiler alert: it didn't, not in this case). From then on, I was hooked. Finlay takes us along with her on her travels to find the origins of the colors of the paintbox, from Ochre to Black and Brown to White and on to Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. Quite a few colors had long, involved, and frequently smelly methods of preparation, and some were discovered quite by accident. Some of Finlay's stories made me want to weep, especially the tale of the two huge Buddha statues in a valley of Afghanistan that had stood for 14 and 15 centuries, and that were destroyed by the Taliban six months after Finlay was able to see them. Her travels are fascinating and always give us the human element of where these colors have come from, so this book can be shelved almost as a travelogue and less as a scholarly paper on the preparation of color for artists' purposes. I was fascinated by the origins of each color name, some familiar from my childhood set of Crayola crayons (burnt sienna being named after a shade that had to be heated to achieve that color, and it supposedly having originated in Siena, Italy). My only regret with this book is when I started it, the week before my birthday. I had no idea I was going to have surprise houseguests for over a week, and so this book did not receive the attention it deserves. I may have to re-read it at some point to absorb more of the information. I found this book to be reminiscent of the works of in its accessibility and engaging writing style. The author is definitely part of the story, but for me, it lent a human aspect and interest that may otherwise have been lacking. Highly recommended."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A mass of information about the natural dyes and pigments used for the seven colours of the rainbow, plus black, white and ochre. Finlay journeys around the world to find the origins of the colours, tracing them through myth, art and history to find out how and where the colours were produced. Each story is fascinating, and she writes in a lively and accessible style. Her research is presented as a quest or adventure, and while this sometimes comes across as slightly overdone, in the chapter on blue the sense of risk and something very precious being at state really becomes apparent. Searching for the main source of lapis lazuli in the world, the mines in Afghanistan, she travels through the Taliban-run country and is able to visit the Buddhas of Bamiyan, whose painted blue auras are the earliest known use of ultramarine, the paint made from lapis lazuli. Just months later, the two giant Buddhas are destroyed by the Taliban. Finlay is clearly a natural storyteller, and weaves her personal anecdotes together with scientific fact and historical information to create a vivid and - of course - colourful tale. Highly recommended."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I've always been interested in color and have previous read The Anthropology of Turquoise: Reflections on Desert, Sea, Stone, and Sky (****) by Ellen Meloy and Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World (*****) by Simon Garfield. Those books are very different, one being about natural history and the other about chemistry influencing fashion and ultimately changing a national industry. Finlay's book is also unique; it's a travelogue where she searches for the historical origin of individual colors. The history of the development and use of each color takes readers on paths through various civilizations, economies, and sometimes wars. If you are interested in color, I suggest you read it a chapter (or color) at a time. Some chapters drag on while others pass more quickly, but almost every chapter has some very interesting tidbits so don't give up- scan a bit :-)"

She's off to Australia, Hawaii, France, Iran (okay we can skip that one), India, and Spain. I want to go to there. Paints have never been a huge interest of mine, but the study of how colors were found (in a plant stamen, in the sludge of a snail, and in the smoosh of a bug) is just really fascinating. The only possible failing of this book is what she makes up in a stunning travelogue, she omits science. I honestly don't know what some of these colors are made up of, how dyes differ from pigments, and how it all works. I just don't know. And I really wanted to. However, this book has given me a great starting point to go further. I now want to read this Art Forgers Handbook, because you never know when you're going to need to fake a Vermeer."

When lumps of rocks were transported across ocean, plants were stolen and smuggled, recipes and techniques were heavily guarded secret. Fittingly it's written by a romantic. Not necessarily of the candle light dinner type, more of those who caress wall texture and go raving mad on dye secreting mollusc. I guess I'm a qualified one so it was a joy read.

We met online each week to discuss each chapter. The book is broken up into chapters thematically by color. My book club leader, Cinnamon Cooney, aptly describes Victoria Finlay as the ""Indiana Jones"" of pigments. This book is part history steeped in mystery and part travel log. Everyone in my book club are avid acrylic painters and we found it a hoot to find out the backstories of our favorite colors and pigments. My only complaint about this book would be how the author divided the sub-chapters within the book. Sometimes each subtitled part of the chapter would be a continuation of information from the previous subtitles and the whole chapter would run together for one whole cohesive story. Other times, Victoria used the subtitles to tell a completely different origin story for another shade of the color being discussed. Then other times, the subtitles were used to jump back and forth from ancient times to a few hundred years ago to present day. Sometimes, I would get lost in certain chapters because of all the jumping around. In other chapters, the transition between topics seemed smoother. A lot of historical figures are well-represented in the book and a detailed bibliography is included to continue on your color journey. All in all, it is a fascinating read for anyone who works daily with colors or likes to create. This book is rather lengthy, and did take me several weeks to tackle, but the descriptions make you feel like you went along on the color journey with Victoria."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A fascinating description of the development of the most vivid pigments used by some of history's most renowned painters. I appreciate her coverage of each of the colors of the rainbow along with black, white, brown and ochre. It is a very anecdotal book, ones from history and those of the author as she traveled to the site where the colours were developed or perfected. Blue from Afghanistan, people from Tyre and Mexico, green from China and Italy, and ochre from Australia. There was a lot of detail I skimmed and immediately forgot, but I'll never forget that Turner intentionally used reds that lost their colour within months, or one of Michelangelos last works was waiting for blue from Afghanistan for Mary's robe, or the imperial purple from Tyre was made from the same shellfish as the blue for Jewish robes. If the history of commodities is your jam, this book will be the pigment of your imagination (with due respect to Pratchett). Victoria Finlay also covers fabric and jewels in other works, and Mark Kurlansky writes on the more prosaic topics of salt, cod and paper."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"When I first picked this book up I remember wondering how the history and making of colour pigments could be so extensive as to cover nearly 500 pages, but still I bought it thinking, ""well it must be good!"" Later I learned the book is exceedingly lengthy because each of Finlays' ""travel stories"" are. Every chapter is dragged on far beyond what's necessary, to the point where the majority of what I read was more about the details of her hotel stays, the small towns she walked in, what car she drove, or what the sky looked like. I was hoping to gain substantial knowledge on how colours have evolved over time, with in-depth descriptions of how exactly each pigment is made in preparation for paint. Instead I turned the last page over being lucky to have gained three or four ""fun facts"". In addition to her lack of genuine findings many of her anecdotes are presumed, using words such as, ""perhaps"", ""maybe"", or ""possibly"" much too often, creating imaginary characters and stories to fulfil her failed search for factual information. This book is advertised as a NON-FICTION history book, delving into the depths of the various ways earth gives us colour and how we use it, but rather reads as a chit-chatty travel journal. However, I still awarded Finlay two stars since there was the occasional captivating story scattered throughout the pages that is well-written, or that presented adequate findings - as if a short breath of fresh air from the polluted water you just spent the last hour paddling through. The minuscule amount of factual research is interesting enough, but in my opinion is not worth having to sort through the fluff of this book for."

Color: A Natural History of the Palette by Victoria Finlay is part travel guide and part anthropological history of pigments and colors… The author takes us on a trip around the world and through history…with the colors as our guide. After an introductory chapter which covers just how hard paints used to be the make (not including if you wanted a rare or expensive color for heavens sake) and how paint technology changed across centuries, the book divides its stories into chapters by color. Each color chapter consists of some light commentary on the history of the color in human culture…and what those colors meant to different areas of the world. Sprinkled throughout are helpful anecdotes (some long, some short) about how those colors were developed at the time… It’s all quite fascinating. Some of the anecdotes were more interesting than others. Just a few to name…colonization’s impact on aboriginal history in Australia and its connection to the ochre trade, a history of saffron as a spice beyond its yellow contributions (including a scandalous story about how a small town was humiliated when the king came to visit and they had to nos saffron to cook with), and how indigo became a major cash crop in colonial Charlestown due to some enterprising women and a war with France.

Look deeply at the world, and see an illusion, a magician's dream.""- The Seventh Dalai Lama: ""Song of the Immaculate Path"" The first challenge in writing about colors is that they don't really exist. Or rather they do exist, but only because our minds create them as an interpretation of vibrations that are happening around us. Everything in the universe--whether it is classified as ""solid"" or ""liquid"" or ""gas"" or even ""vacuum""--is shimmering and vibrating and constantly changing. But our brains don't find that a very useful way of comprehending the world. So we translate what we experience into concepts like ""objects"" and smells"" and ""sounds"" and, of course, ""colors,"" which are altogether easier for us to understand. - pg 4 What is important to remember about ""chemical"" coloring is that the light actually does affect the object. When light shines on a leaf, or a daub of paint, or a lump of butter, it actually causes it to rearrange its electrons, in a process called ""transition."" There the electrons are, floating quietly in clouds within their atoms, and suddenly a ray of light shines on them. Imagine a soprano singing high C and shattering a wineglass, because she catches its natural vibration. Something similar happens with the electrons, is a portion of the light happens to catch their natural vibration. It shoots them to another energy level and that relevant bit of light, that glass-shattering ""note"", is used up and absorbed. The rest is reflected out, and our brains read it as ""color"". - pg 5 For some reason it is easier to understand this idea of electromagnetic waves actually altering what they touch when you are talking about invisible ones like X rays. It is hard to believe that light--lovely friendly white light--also changes almost every object it hits, and not only the ones that contain chlorophyll which are waiting for the right wavebands of light to make them photosynthesize. The best way I've found of understanding this is to think not so much of something ""being"" a color but of it ""doing"" a color. the atoms in a ripe tomato are busy shivering--or dancing or singing; the metaphors can be as joyful as the colors they describe--in such a way that when white light falls on them they absorb most of the blue and yellow light and they reject the red--meaning that the ""red"" tomato is actually one that contains every wavelength except red. A week before, those atoms would have been doing a slightly different dance--absorbing the red light and rejecting the rest, to give the appearance of a green tomato instead. - pg 6 ""In old days the secrets were the artist's; now he is the first to be kept in ignorance of what he is using."" William Holman Hunt, in an address to the London Society of Arts ""What did I learn at art school? I learned that art is painting, not painted.""

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I found this book fascinating, absorbing and exquisitely researched. In it the author takes us on a journey of discovery to look at dyes and pigments from before our current aniline dyes were invented. The chapters are named after the colour, and in each one we look at the historical basis of the colour, where it came from, what it was used for how it was described in the past. So a great deal of many of the things I love best feature in this book: The great artists and their artwork are characters in this book; Van Gough, who 'knew the value of good paint'. Turner, who I find out, was careless of choosing good quality pigments, which is why so many of his paintings discoloured so fast. Michaelangelo, who could not wait for blue pigment to arrive from the east and never finished his painting since the virgin mary could only be painted in that particular blue. Then there is the travel element, another thing I love. Victoria visited so many places in this novel; she visited the mines in Afghanistan where Michaelangelo's blue never arrived in time from. Mexico, to look at the indigo violet colour of skirts, after first searching for indigo in India. We also stop by China and its porcelain, in an exploration of glazes, archaeology and history. Victoria also describes how she was lucky enough to see several amazing structures that have since been destroyed by islamic culture terrorists. She is lucky, too late for me to ever see them now, the extent of her journeys in the book is remarkable. There is heaps of history, some of it I already knew some of; the incredible history of lead white, the fashion of using it until you died, still fashionable. Only one thing puzzled me somewhat; in the chapter where Victoria goes to the Lebanon searching for the murax shell that was the source of the Phoenicians purple dye, and their wealth.... They have been renamed Hexaplex for quite a while and the dye producing gastropods are small, muddy looking and insignificant, they bear no resemblance to the elegant spiky shells Victoria described which are the 'modernly named' Murex. Also I am pretty sure (not %100, but at least 70-80) that the source of the dye was kept secret and expensive for so long because it had to be harvested on the Atlantic side of the pillars of Hercules, you couldn't just pick it up on any Mediterranean beach you happened to be wandering on. That was why it was so rare, and why the Phoenician empire was so secretive and exclusive about it. You had to have exceptional boats and seamanship to get to the harvesting grounds. Anyhow, I loved this book but I won't recap it all here, if you like art, travel, history, anecdotes and knowing more about the world around us, you should read it. If you, like me, love knowing about art, pigments, how colour is made then you must read it!"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Ranked at high end of 3, hence 4 stars. This turned into a lengthy bedtime read (darn if I don’t fall asleep holding a book). If the history of pigments and dyes interest you, most likely you will enjoy this author’s dogged determination to track down the original sources of the various colors. Another reviewer called this a travelogue, which is accurate; the author’s determination to get to the location of the mineral, plant, or animal that provided a color was amazing, to say the least. She not only traveled to remote, rural, rarely visited, and difficult terrain, but also war torn and dangerous areas. I can only think that once she decided to write this book and “see for herself” she became a bit obsessive in the pursuit. I knew about lapis lazuli blue being part of an artist’s contract during the renaissance. I knew about madder and cochineal. But there was much I did not know: lead white in cosmetics killing women, the chinoiserie trend of a “Chinese” green made with the additive of arsenic, etc. This lead to the theory that what actually caused Napoleon’s illness and death was the damp weather releasing the arsenic in his bedroom/sitting room’s green wallpaper (verified much later from a recovered scrap of the wallpaper). Nor did she neglect to explore all the slaves, underpaid and often impoverished people that did what was frequently dirty, extremely odiferous, dangerous, and sometimes deadly work. Our author liked to fantasize about the lives of various people connected to the colors, which an historian would not do. Fictitious characters and their lives were a step too far in this nonfictional book. I’m not sure why she would not have edited out these parts and keep them for her personal journals. She also spent a great deal of time on the difficulties of obtaining permits, visas, transportation, and willing participants on her quests. And often her quests seemed very quixotic. But her enthusiasm and excitement never seemed to waiver. All in all, an interesting book to those of us with a curiosity about natural pigments.

There's a lot of painful history, including poisonous paints and slave-grown indigo. A lot of cool factoids, as well. But at the same time, I had the growing sense that the author was being self-indulgent. She interviews a man who tried to help the Aborigines and failed and whose life is blighted as a result. She gets a guy to take her out to look for sea snails in life-threatening conditions. She bullies her way into Afghanistan during the height of the Taliban's reign so she can see the mine where lapis lazuli comes from. And it's not like she's some investigative reporter who will bring home a story to open people's eyes to the plight of the people who she talks to. She's writing about paint. And I couldn't help but wonder if maybe the poor folk at the embassy had something better to do with their time than help her get in with the UN workers. That said, it's a diverting little book that's informative and entertaining, if not enthralling and earth-shattering."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"2009 bookcrossing review I started reading this sometime last year. I got half way through then put it down for some reason. It got piled over other bits and I kind of forgot about it. I was tidying up last week and found it again and decided I needed to finish it. This was a really interesting read. It's a mix of history, culture, travel, geology etc etc - a lot of interesting anecdotes and facts, so you travel the world with her discovering the story of colour. The last few chapters that I read this week stick in my mind the most right now, and some of her travels are a little mind boggling - bearing in mind that they were research for a book about colour. She literally travelled the globe. She went to Iran to see the saffran cultivation. She went into Afghanistan (yes, after the terrorist attacks on the US) to see lapis lazuli mines in the mountains. As with her book on jewels, there is a lot in here and by the time you get to the end, you've forgotten a lot of it even though it was interesting at the time. So I think this is one of those books that will stand multiple readings. Really good, although maybe a little more rambling that the Jewel book. Still really worth reading though."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is not just a history of color, but a bustling travelogue of the world; Victoria Finlay is just my type of traveler-- she has a plan but she doesn't. She hears of a place where a color was developed and she goes, and hopefully, just hopefully, she meets the right people and finds what she is looking for. It's all very serendipitous. The book is categorized by colors; beginning with the earth tones (which, oddly enough, come from the earth) and moves on to my favorites of green, blues, and violet. While this is fun global romp searching for the origins of color, it is laced with the nostalgia of understanding of how people before us lived, where creating art was in fact creation: from preparing the piece to be painted to crushing, mixing, blending the paint to understanding how different mediums react to each other. Finlay also reaffirms that it is in the pieces imperfections that make them beautiful, and she explains how many beautiful colors relied on shit to be so. Color is an interesting read, and Finlay is an irreverent, speculative, and open tour guide through the palette."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"After four years of obsessively painting watercolor & developing relationships with the pigments in my palette (so what ARE PB29 and PBR7 anyway? I still don’t really know…) I figured I should read this book. The author goes on a journey through mainly naturally derived colors and it’s pretty fascinating. I learned a LOT. I enjoyed all of her travel stories and she is a real character. (Example - She seemed genuinely excited to return to Taliban ruled Afghanistan alone to find lapis lazuli mines, and was also happy when their Jeep broke down so they could finish the journey on foot as it would be a true conquest.) She has the soul of an explorer and her humor has that certain “something” that makes certain English people so entertaining. My only potentially negative is that this book really meanders. A lot! It took longer than usual to finish, and by the time I got to the violet chapter I really felt ready to be done. Overall a great book!"
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Very informing, if somewhat demanding book. I would have liked more on colour theory and harmony, but as a historical travelogue about the craft of mixing colours from raw ingredients - something we take for granted these days - I can't imagine a more detailed account. Perhaps the structure would have benefited from a chronological account rather than based on which colour the author is investigating. This makes for a slightly disjointed read. However, for quick reference, such a structure is a help and would make a good coffee table book. Too many anecdotes to mention as favourites - although I particularly enjoyed reading about Newcastle exporting urine of all things to the south to help make dyes. I'm not taking the piss."

As a young girl, the colors of a stained glass window captured her imagination, and from then on she has been fascinated with color and how it is made.

She is a tireless researcher, a fearless traveler and a wonderful storyteller, so her exploration of all the colors (in rainbow order) is fascinating and fun."

It's a fantastic overview of the history of color and definitely got me wanting to read more on the subject. The main problem with the book is that the writing is good while the scholarship is so-so. That may be an editorial decision, I don't know. I just know that there were a lot of things I wanted to learn more about, and had difficulty doing so by looking at her sources. This is really only a problem if you're a giant nerd. Overall, great book."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"As one who is just learning to paint, it is remarkable to think about the added layers of complexity it would take to paint a masterpiece, while also making sure your paints don't react with each other. It also helps me understand why some older works look the way they do, and that they might have been different when the artist first completed it. I did find her fanciful dreaming a bit annoying after a while, and really wanted to know more about the paints' stories, rather than what she dreamed about the night she arrived somewhere."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I find it troubling how often this nonfiction book uses the words ""I imagine"". The book reads more like a travelogue/ diary with facts thrown in than anything else. I'm also really troubled that on page 28 or so the author makes it sound as if shes drawn on a historical site when he finds a bit of ochre. Maybe I'm reading wrong ( its a really unclear bit of writing) but it really rubs the amateur archaeologist in me the wrong way. If a book starts off with that kind of disrespect for a site, what will I find if I read on? Note: I didn't finish this book. The above had me abandoning ship."

Some chapters are more informative than others. Essentially the book is a travelogue with the trips held together by the common theme of color. By far the weakest chapter is ""Orange"" in that it is more a chapter about music than it is about the hue Finlay was supposedly studying. The best chapters are ""Red"", ""Yellow"" and ""Blue."" In these three chapters Finlay hits her stride, tracking down the history, politics and oddities of these hues."

Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Colors fascinate us. Most of us can name a short list of favorite colors, often trying to surround ourselves in them so we may experience them on a regular basis. We may be drawn to something because of its color: a flower in a vase, perhaps, or a cake in a display case. Certain combinations may be off-putting (some neon colors slapped together give the fashion police conniptions), while others are soothing, or exciting, or surreal. So much of our daily experience comes through the eyes, after all, more than any other sensory organ, so it should come as no surprise that color is important to us - more so than some of us might think. As a matter of fact, color has been important throughout history. There have been regulations and prohibitions and prescriptions and proscriptions about what colors can and cannot be used, by whom, and when. Colors are also often associated with certain concepts and socio-cultural norms, used as a kind of shorthand, even though they are actually quite arbitrary. Why is black so often associated with death, when in China and Japan they wear white to funerals? Why is red linked to carnal sin, while blue is linked to virtuousness? Why is yellow linked to cowardice, and green to envy? And why does orange not rhyme with anything, anyway? Perhaps such questions can be answered by finding out where the colors come from in the first place. Wars have been fought over purple, and blue was, for a time, one of the most expensive colors in the world. Yellow, too, was held in high esteem - high enough that in China, only emperors could wear it. And while white was valued, it was also notoriously deadly. These questions - and more - were raised and some were answered in by Victoria Finlay. She doesn't cover all the colors, of course, simply choosing a set all readers know and recognize: the seven colors of the rainbow, but also including black, brown, white, and - surprisingly - ochre, with which she begins the book. After that, she moves on to black and brown, so often linked with death and the earth; then to white: also linked to death, though for other reasons. From there she goes into the rainbow colors, telling stories of bugs, violins, spices, porcelain, gemstones, weeds and seashells. In the epilogue, fittingly enough, she takes us to the Pantone headquarters in New Jersey, showing us the future of color in an increasingly digital world. The good thing about this book is that each individual section on each color can be read on its own. While it's obvious that the history of some colors intertwine with each other, Finlay is capable of keeping the strands separate, so that the reader can easily hop on over to read about a specific color without having to go through the rest of the book. Of course, doing so would leave out some very interesting stories - and, strangely enough, the most interesting stories belonged to the colors that I assumed would be the least interesting. Take, for example, the story of ochre, which is the first color discussed in the book, and which, Finlay says, launched her on this grand quest to begin with. Beginning on a cliffside in Italy, she eventually finds her way to Australia and to the Aborigines, for whom ochre is not just a color, but a representation of everything that they are. In this chapter Finlay tells a heartbreaking story of how Aboriginal art is slowly being commercialized, and how valuable ochre mines - one of which is the only source of a particularly special type used in secret ceremonies and equally secret artwork of the Dreamtime - has become nigh-on inaccessible due to politics and greed. In this chapter the loss of a color is depicted as the loss of a culture, and it is incredibly heartbreaking. In the chapter for black and brown, Finlay loses the thread a bit, jumping all over the place as she describes the different uses for black, framing it around a legend told of the first painting. For some strange reason this just wasn't as interesting as the story of the Aborigines and their ochre, maybe because the tales about coal and pencil leads just wasn't as interesting as the story of an ongoing cultural loss. To be sure, getting black isn't as easy to create as the reader might assume, especially when trying to get it to stick, or fix, to fabric, but even that supposed difficulty made for rather uninteresting reading. When sepia was brought up I was hoping for some investigation into that particular brown color, but it didn't quite materialize. This chapter was weak, unfortunately, especially in comparison to the one before it. The chapter for white proved a bit more intriguing, on one hand because it turns out white is a difficult color to make, and on the other because it's so deadly. The most popular white paint is made of lead, and it's been used by painters because it has a very specific quality to it that's much admired and much desired by artists. Today most commercially accessible white paint is made with titanium, which is much less dangerous than lead, but lead white is still available: carefully controlled, and rather expensive to boot. It also dips briefly into other kinds of white that were less dangerous, but which didn't catch on because lead white was so popular, at least until the introduction of titanium paints. This chapter waxes nostalgic quite often, about how things just aren't quite the same anymore, and how sometimes, the old things are just better than the new things - even if they deadly. The chapter on red (one of my favorite colors) was another disappointment, though for different reasons than the chapter on black and brown. It used to be that red was a deadly color, made as it was from cinnabar, from which mercury is extracted. Synthetic reds served for a time, and still do in certain applications, but have proven too harsh for makeup. It wasn't until the reintroduction of carmine for commercial purposes that people could slick their lips with red again, or paint their nails with it without doing damage to themselves in the process. Finlay does go and look into carmine production, starting with the bug from which the color is made, but when she describes the process of crushing hundreds of thousands of cochineal beetles to make the color, she does so with a certain amount of guilt, and no small amount of cringing. I found this odd, to say the least - or perhaps I could care less. The cochineal beetle isn't about to go extinct anytime soon, after all, so I do not feel the least bit guilty knowing that a hundred thousand beetles died to make my favorite lipstick this exquisite shade of slightly brick-like red, or my favorite nail polish the same shade as a Ferrari sports car. Also, carmine production has significantly improved the livelihood of those who produce it, especially since it can be made on what would otherwise be land unsuitable for any other agricultural purpose. I rather hoped Finlay would celebrate that uplifting aspect of carmine production, but she doesn't quite do so, which is unfortunate. The next chapter, which tackles orange, surprised me the most. I wasn't quite sure where Finlay would begin her journey to understand this color with a name that does not rhyme with anything, so for her to start in the Italian town of Cremona, and with the famous violins made there, was rather surprising. But Finlay was on to something: by trying to understand the mysterious varnish used for the Cremonese violins as they were made by Stradivari and the Amatis, she hoped to trace the story of the color she intended to tackle in this section. This she did, with a certain degree of success, but I thought the color was made more interesting by the fact that, as with the story of ochre, she connected it to another interesting story: that of the mysterious Jewish luthier who first brought the art of making stringed instruments to Cremona, and who likely taught apprentices who would, eventually, perfect their craft - and their varnish - to produce the legendary Stradivari and Amati violins. It concludes on a bittersweet note: how the art of violin-making is no longer as admired as it once was in Cremona; and how the power of music is capable of taking things as insubstantial as memory and emotion making them so concrete the listener can almost taste them. As a fan of violins, violinists and violin music, the concluding portion of this section was quite beautiful to read. The chapters for yellow and green felt more or less similar, though Finlay's search takes her to very different parts of the globe. In yellow she traces the path of saffron, which is not only an excellent spice but also produces a beautiful yellow dye that has been used for centuries. Green, on the other hand, traces the path of Chinese celadon, in an attempt to understand why this particular type of porcelain is so special. The chapter on yellow was somewhat more interesting to me than the chapter on green, mostly because food is intertwined in the story of saffron, and that's a topic I will always find interesting, wherever I can come across it. Finlay's quest for celadon is interesting in its own way too, involving as it does secret chambers and buried treasure, but that's not quite so appealing to me as a cup of saffron tea, said to be capable of making one cheerful even if one is in the blackest of moods. The chapter for blue tells the story of the color framed in another heartbreaking story: that of art as casualty in wartime. In an attempt to track down the source of the lapis lazuli that was once ground by Renaissance artists to make ultramarine, Finlay passes through Taliban-controlled territory in Afghanistan (the trip was done just before 9/11), and relays her encounter with the giant Bamiyan Buddhas, which were destroyed by the Taliban scant months after her visit. Her quest is interesting, to be sure, but I find her stories of pre-war, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to be more intriguing than her attempt to reach the mines where the lapis is pulled from. It was not as bad as some Americans made it out to be, in those crazy years immediately following 9/11, but neither was it all sunshine and butterflies, either. The latter end of the chapter was interesting as well, because it dealt with stained glass - specifically, the blue in the stained glass windows of Chartres Cathedral. It corrected me on something I thought was factual: the recipe for that particular shade of blue is indeed known, and can even be replicated, if a glassmaker so chose. The problem, however, is that there is a certain shimmer in the glass, a certain refraction of light within it that gives medieval stained glass a magical quality unique to it, and that is what modern glassmakers can never hope to reproduce. Something about production during the medieval period created imperfect - but magnificently beautiful - glass, and those imperfections, no matter how desirable, are impossible to replicate. The last two colors, indigo and violet/purple, are caught up in the idea of conquest and colonization. In the chapter for indigo Finlay briefly goes into woad as a source of blue before tackling indigo, which was a primary crop in India and the Caribbean - both colonized by European powers. The story surrounding indigo in those areas of the world is a sad one, filled with all the tragedies that accompany slavery and plantation-style agriculture. As for purple, Finlay goes all the way to Tyre, thinking to find the original source of ""Tyrian purple,"" but fails to do so, heading instead to Mexico, where colonialism almost killed a tradition of creating purple from seashells that are held sacred by the Mixtec, and who care for this source of color more greatly than the Japanese industrialists who almost rendered the species extinct. As with the case with many nonfiction books, the success of rests on its ability to tell a good story while delivering excellent researhc. For the most part, Finlay manages to do so, though it's not quite so even. In the chapters for black and brown, as I mentioned earlier, Finlay seems unable to find a truly compelling story for these colors and so hops and skips around, going from the cave paintings in Altamira to the Greek legend about the first painting, and from there to the Puritans and back to the Greek legend, and so on. But when she has a compelling story, she uses it successfully: the chapters for ochre and orange are prime examples of this. It really depends on what the reader finds interesting, so reactions to the individual chapters will vary. Fortunately, as I mentioned earlier, the chapters are not connected to each other, so it's possible for a reader to skip over something without missing out on too much. Overall, is an entertaining and interesting read. The research is well-done, and there will be quite a bit here that the reader may find surprising, especially if he or she hasn't really looked into the origins and histories of the colors discussed. Finlay can tell a good story, but only as long as she has one: if she doesn't have one, she can get a bit scattered, which may make some readers lose interest and skip on ahead. Doing so, though, would be a pity, because the book as a whole is well-written and organized, and Finlay's research seems quite sound. Some patience may be required in some parts, but on the whole, it's worth that patience."

Imagine; greenery unattached to the public domain—how decadent. It was pretty fantastic to be in an outdoor spot that didn’t contain a thousand other people vying for the same five-by-five patch of grass and sky. And the stomach is the impetus of all my travel, so between the views and the food, I will call both ventures a success. These extended periods on the train also gave me a few stretches to actually get in to after dragging my feet through the first forty pages. starts off with the surprisingly weak chapter. It sets a rather monotonous (-ous? eh?) pace—I didn’t find the author’s trip to the Australian outback gripping, and I didn’t pick out much else that was interesting to me, either. It lacks the panoply of tidbits and insights that stuff the later chapters with life: I can understand, functionally, that ochre has chronological precedent—the Australian cave paintings, done with ochre, are dated almost thirty thousand years ago—but to frontload the book with the weakest chapter was a hard sell. Perhaps the editors believed that people would jump around, selecting the colors they wanted to read at the time rather than approach the work as a monolithic rainbowed entity. Also worth considering is the explanation that this chapter is fascinating to most readers and I lack a point of entry for this information to impact me. Weighed against the strength of the rest of the book, the fault of failing to find any of the details about indigenous Australians accessible or interesting likely lies with me rather than with the author. But by the time I made it to the chapter about red, though, I was hooked. It became so packed with information that it was nearly impossible to put down. I wasn’t as interested in the travelogue aspects as I was in discovering what piece of color-contextual history would next be unearthed: I’m not sure in what other context someone would be able to discuss the realpolitik behind the British logwood laws, or why someone would ever learn about it. But the fascination lies less in the details than in the main thrust of history—that the realities of mercenary mercantilism formed the idealist propaganda of protectionist nationalism five hundred years ago. is at its best when it combines the dissemination of esoteric fact with the oblique historical context that surrounds, informs and often directs the path of a society: Color is everywhere, but why that particular color is en vogue or even simply available is often the most fascinating story. When a can of grapefruit-flavored wheat beer was making its rounds at the barbeque, I would like to say my first thoughts were about how and why, rather than the typical murky golden, it was a soft, foamy red. hadn’t quite taken over my brain completely though, so when I noticed, it was only in hindsight; when I opened the book for the uptown trip back home, I began a nearly twenty page discussion of cochineal, the South American insect used to make red dye. Cochineal, the same term that was displayed on the can of beer, to which no one had a definite response. Someone even remarked on prominent “contains cochineal” was—slightly out of place, like a Surgeon General’s warning label on a pack of cigarettes—it certainly drew attention. But while the answer was, as always, only a googled cellphone tap away, something about weekend barbeques made us all eschew technological research—no matter how mundane—and just enjoy the sun. Perhaps we’re old. Had my train arrived in Brooklyn a page and a half later, the word would have been floating around in my head after it made its first triumphant appearance in the pages of . Oh, the lament for a missed opportunity; would I have been able to resist the ineluctable draw of erudite kismet; learning and being asked the same obscure term within the same hour? To don the mantle of the serpent—destroyer of innocence—and illuminate an abyss perhaps best kept in shadow; in this instance, that everyone was about to imbibe an aesthetic trickle of bug blood? It is my belief that someone at that party knew the mysteries of cochineal yet was altruistic enough to keep the rest of us in blessed ignorance. Noblesse oblige is alive and well and living in Park Slope. I doubt my self-control would have been strong enough to avoid blurting out the truth—even the author acknowledges the temptation of spewing forth fascinating but useless facts: When I write reviews for non-fiction, I tend to excerpt the facts and strip them of their commentary, unless I’m talking about the authorial presence in the narrative. The dry banter throughout adds an immense value, and the above illustrates how a likable author can carry the reader through any subject. The minutia is interesting but partially irrelevant; what is most fascinating is the basic concept that color and creation can be tied to history through physical production. You can look at art and artifacts and see politics, economics, or trade if you know where to look. The blues of later Ming vases are weak because of trade sanctions against the parts of central Asia where the best cobalt mines were located. Will future archaeologists parse the coltan content in cell phone disposal areas to draw conclusions about central African politics, lingering colonial imperialism, and the reach of global capitalism? While I cannot quite thrill onlookers with distance Ming vase identification—and I’ve vaulted the truth of cochineal, never to be uttered—woe betide the next fool who broaches the subject of Robin Hood with me around: I’m similarly poised with the derivation of : While the time between learning these cocktail facts and bon mots and an appropriate unforced opportunity to share them is typically long enough to have forgotten the exact details—it took me two and a half years from learning why the Tappen Zee Bridge spans a particularly wide point of the Hudson to find a natural opening in a conversation to introduce that information—you don’t need to impress others with an exactitude and plethora of tiny facts to have those selfsame facts slowly impact your view of the world writ large. The seemingly trivial and pedantic details that good non-fiction books impart may not truly matter with specificity—outside of , showing off at barbeques, or during a thesis defense—but the thousand thousand petty details make up all things in life. It is nice to be reminded that—despite the fear of misremembering the tetchy particulars that the omnipresent threat of the pop quiz instills—sometimes the details matter less than the gist. A dozen books from now, I won’t remember whether it was Valentian or Aurelius who restricted purple, but I will remember the sense of time and history syncing up, of color as a thing unto itself: fought over; monopolized; traded and sold. I will remember color comes from and places and people. And I will remember what a wonderful experience was to read."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"British journalist, writer, social anthropologist Victoria Finley traveled half the world, went down into mines and climbed mountains, froze, got wet and melted from the heat to collect everything about color under one cover. To clarify, not about color as such, the book is dedicated to the history of natural colors. The thing that decorated and brightened the world for millennia before the phenomenon of the mass culture of coloristics - aniline dyes. What painters wrote, what dyers dyed fabrics with, what gave color to architectural masterpieces, what colors fashionistas shaded natural beauty and warriors intimidated the enemy. Red, orange, yellow, green, light blue, purple. Carmine, cochineal, meerkat, cinnabar, iodine, saffron, bastard saffron and dragon's blood, turmeric, gummigut and auripigment, Chinese green mi se, yar-copper, celadon, Afghan lapis lazuli, indigo, vida, Tyrian purple. She knows how to tell about everything in an entertaining and moderately scientific way. Британская журналистка, писательница, социальный антрополог Виктория Финли объездила полмира, спускалась в шахты и поднималась в горы, мерзла, мокла и плавилась от жары, чтобы собрать под одной обложкой все о цвете. Уточню, не о цвете как таковом, книга посвящена истории природных красок. Тому, что украшало и расцвечивало мир тысячелетия до явления масскульта колористики - анилиновых красителей. Чем писали живописцы, чем окрашивали ткани красильщики, что дарило цвет архитектурным шедеврам, какими красками модницы оттеняли природную красоту а воины устрашали противника. Еще одно уточнение, ""Цвет. Захватывающее путешествие по оттенкам палитры"" - это перевод американского издания Color: A Natural History of the Palette, более объемного, в сравнении с английским вариантом той же книги Colour: Travels Through The Paintbox, которое прежде выходило в петербургской ""Амфоре"" как перевод с английского издания под заглавием ""Земля. Тайная история красок"". То есть, если вы уже читали ту Финли, эта не даст вам ничего или почти ничего, за исключением добавленных глав об австралийских аборигенах - интересных как социальные и антропологические заметки, но с точки зрения цвета мало информативных. Теперь о книге. Тяга к красоте так же естественна, как утоление потребностей нижних, в сравнении с эстетическими, этажей пирамиды Маслоу. Да и не сводится цвет к одной только эстетике. На уровне базисных потребностей - камуфляжная окраска помогала охотнику слиться с пейзажем и обеспечить племя едой; агрессивная позволяла воину устрашить противника, косвенно работая на обеспечение безопасности. На уровне социальных - цвет во все времена служил маркером уровня благосостояния и престижа, общественного положения, рода занятий. Не стоит недооценивать роли красок в нашей жизни. Открывает книгу глава об Охре, окиси железа - самом распространенном натуральном красителе, которым пользовались на всех континентах, затем следуют главы о черном и коричневом цветах - в живописности и украшении жизни не самых привлекательных, но базовых с точки зрения эскиза, чертежа, письма. Уголь, жженная кость, сок растений, графит. Запомнились две истории о графитовом карандаше. Первая о том, почему чаще всего цвет деревянного корпуса желтый - потому что первыми промышленный выпуск наладили китайцы, желтый цвет стал отличительным знаком качественных маньчжурских карандашей. Когда в Северной Америке открыли графитовое месторождение и начали промышленный выпуск этого продукта, то цвет деревянного корпуса оставили желтым - в сознании потребителя он уже закрепился как знак качества. И вторая, о том, что в рамках космической программы NASA американцы потратили десятки тысяч долларов на разработку прибора, который позволит делать записи в невесомости, когда же у русских спросили, как они планируют решать эту проблему, ответ был: ""У нас есть простой карандаш"". Дальше белый, куда без него: опасные свинцовые белила, стоившие здоровья и жизни многим модницам, белая кость, яичная скорлупа и даже жемчуг. А потом Финли и мы вместе с ней пускаемся в путешествие по цветам спектра. Классика жанра: красный, оранжевый, желтый, зеленый, голубой, синий, фиолетовый. Кармин, кошениль, сурик, киноварь, йод, шафран, ублюдочный шафран и кровь дракона, куркума, гуммигут и аурипигмент, китайский зеленый ми се, ярь-медянка, селадон, афганская ляпис-лазурь, индиго, вайда, тирский пурпур. Обо всем она умеет рассказать занимательно и в меру научно. Последнее в том смысле, что эта книга достаточно легкое чтение. В ней много исторических баек, путевых заметок о современном положении дел в регионах, прежде служивших источником того или иного красителя. Порой забавных, порой пугающих, всегда интересных. Виктория Финли достойный популяризатор, книга о цвете легко и с удовольствием читается, а на выходе мы знаем о природных красителях гораздо больше и чуть больше - об устройстве мира в целом."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The author of this fascinating book goes to the ends of the world (Australia, Afghanistan, Miztec Mexico, remote villages in Peru and India) looking for the raw materials -- plant, animal, and mineral -- from which came the pigments for all of the world's art, be it folk or fine, up until very recently, as well as the dyes used for clothing and the paint used for buildings. Finlay came at her story by way of social anthropology rather than through art history, but the book offers a fine interplay between the two disciplines: from the blood of Peruvian cactus-loving bugs comes the carmine paint that J.M.W. Turner loved for sunsets even though it had downside of not being as permanent a tint as other reds; Turner, with the artist's sensibility of the moment, went for vividness as it appeared to him, and to hell with posterity. Similarly there is speculation that an unfinished Michelangelo went unfinished because the right blue paint for the Virgin Mary's dress -- a deep blue made from lapis lazuli -- was unavailable, in part probably because of its expense. This bit of art history informs Finlay's travels deep into war-torn, post 9/11 Afghanistan, where she treks overland to a lapis mine never before visited by a woman. On more than one occasion, having identified a potential location from historic travel accounts, Finlay finds her way to this inevitably out-of-the-way place, asks around after her sought-after destination, is met with the response, ""Oh, that disappeared long ago,"" only to have someone approach her out of the blue (or some other color) with the inside knowledge she needs to find what she's looking for. Each ""color"" gets a chapter: black, brown, white, and the Roy G. Biv of the spectrum, and each one is as entrancing as the next in its use of the entire spectrum of human experience, from the local praxis of pigment farming/mining (which category is seashell-diving for the source of imperial purple?) and initial extraction (which often seems to have been the kind of extremely stinky job that was used to justify slave labor), to the technological puzzles of fixing the pigment, to the dyer's loom or the painter's brush, all the way up to the macro aspects of buccaneering, mercantilism, keeping trade secrets, passing sumptuary laws to keep the average Joe from wearing the imperial purple (as if he could afford it), and so ravaging the environment of a source of pigment that it becomes too rare to allow for continued production (as in the case of the Mediterranean shellfish that provided imperial purple). Living in the age of industrial chemistry, I find that I have a stunted view of paints and dyes, one that pretty much takes their availability for granted. This book serves not only as a corrective on the subject of the ""gift"" of manipulable color -- the so-called traditional technologies that discovered and enabled them -- but it also serves to awaken a deeper appreciation for all the other products of civilization (beer, for example) that I owe to the genius of my long-ago forebears. And here it all is, in black -- though perhaps not as rich a black as that derived from the core of a Caribbean tree by pirates to the tailors of the Puritans -- and white -- though definitely not as sparkling or poisonous as lead white, which artists suffered illness to paint and with which, used as makeup, women killed themselves."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have studied a fair bit of art history, but I've never thought much about what it took to create the colorful pigments on the canvases in all those museums. I've read books about fashion, and enjoyed exhibits of historical clothing, yet I've given only a passing thought to how artisans turned cloth a rainbow of colors. Victoria Finlay's micro history of the color palette chases around the world looking for the origins of the earliest dyes and pigments, and it's pretty fascinating. I learned about blues from lapis lazuli rocks, reds from cochineal beetles, indigo from bushes, green from a chemical reaction involving wood ash and kaolin, yellow from saffron, and on and on. I was particularly interested to find out which historical coloring agents were poisonous (obviously the lead that brought such brilliant whites onto the canvas, the greens in arsenic-laced wallpapers, and some of the cosmetics from early eras). It was fun to learn how secret recipes were kept, and how intellectual espionage was a regular game of the trade. One of the things that stood out for me from the book was the discussion of how paintings (and other painted and dyed items) have changed with time. I always assumed the darkened altar pieces and canvases I've seen were dark just because they were dirty and coated with pollution. I had no idea certain pigments reacted with others, and would darken and chemically change with time. I was also surprised to learn some artists used colors they knew would quickly fade because they were more concerned with with the short-term product (J.M.W. Turner, I'm talking to you - you knew your watery sunset scenes would lose all their reds in just a few years, and that what hangs in the National Gallery in London is not at all what it started out to be). BUT - and it's a big but - I lost my enthusiasm for the subject as the chapters went on and on. I loved the beginning. I was entranced through the chapters on black and white and red, but as we moved through the spectrum I got a little bogged down. Finlay went so many places - the Australian outback, China, Afghanistan, the Caribbean, Spain, India, etc etc etc - looking for the stories behind the colors. While I would have appreciated every one individually, I got tired of them collectively. I think this book could best be appreciated read drawn out over a longer time period, with a chapter soaked up here and there. There is such good information, and the author put so much time and effort to gathering all her stories. And her writing itself is so engaging. I just pushed through it too hurriedly to keep in touch with that engagement. Anyway, 3.75 stars rounded up to a 4."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Interesting read. I was amazed at how I, as an artist, just took color for granted. How have I never considered where any of it came from? Interesting subject matter aside, I really did not enjoy Finlay's writing style. Many of her jokes fell flat, and often her sentence structures were overly complicated and confusing. I also felt like her travel stories were like listening to Tolkien's Treebeard. On and on and on without getting to a point. When she finally arrived to some conclusion of the travel, I was bored beyond caring. My main complaint it that, despite being ""A Natural History of Color"", Finlay uses ""probably"", ""maybe"", and ""I'd like to imagine"" far more often than a nonfictional history book should. This took much of the credibility out of her words, and I lost interest because I felt like every story had to be taken with a grain of salt. After every, ""probably"" I would skim over the paragraph, wondering why this author chose to include, yet again, something that wasn't strictly factual. The book would have benefited immensely from some very aggressive editing. A bit of a disappointment, considering how spectacular the intro was : ""When light shines on a leaf, or a daub of paint, or a lump of butter, it actually causes it to rearrange its electrons, in a process called ""transition."" There the electrons are, floating quietly in clouds within their atoms, and suddenly a ray of light shines on them. Imagine a soprano singing a high C and shattering a wineglass, because she catches its natural vibration. Something similar happens with the electrons, if a portion of the light happens to catch their natural vibration. It shoots them to another energy level and that relevant bit of light, that glass-shattering ""note,"" is used up and absorbed. The rest is reflected out, and our brains read it as ""color."".... The best way I've found of understanding this is to think not so much of something ""being"" a color but of it ""doing"" a color. The atoms in a ripe tomato are busy shivering - or dancing or singing, the metaphors can be as joyful as the colors they describe - in such a way that when white light falls on them they absorb most of the blue and yellow light and they reject the red - meaning paradoxically that the ""red"" tomato is actually one that contains every wavelength except red. A week before, those atoms would have been doing a slightly different dance - absorbing the red light and rejecting the rest, to give the appearance of a green tomato instead."""
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"As a geographer and natural scientist, I loved this book that intertwines place and time. Some passages are so well written as to be almost poetic in their exposition. Nowadays, people take the near-infinite range of available color for granted, both through the ability of our screens to mix RGB into a broad spectrum of additive light hues, and the ability of our printers to dispense CMYK to emulate a broad range of colors through the pointillist mixing of subtractive pigments. But this is a relatively new state of affairs. Prior to the advent of anilines derived from coal tar in the mid-19th Century, colors were extremely limited, costly, and challenging to produce. Indeed, the history of fine art is intertwined with the range of regional palettes as they evolved with the alchemy of the paintbox; and, the history of fashion is similarly intertwined with the changing recipes used in local dye vats. The natural world had to be manipulated with what amounted to witchcraft and wizardry, an admixture of serendipity and poorly understood ""magical"" processes of fermentation, alkalization, and irradiation to transmute rare rocks, special plants, sea creatures, ash, and piss into paints and dyes. These fetid and often dangerous works that resulted in the enslavement and deaths of millions upon millions through the millennia were often secretive, and the methods to make colors were often lost in the violent tumults of history. Victoria Finlay goes on quests around the world, chasing down archival tales of pre-aniline colors, from the Dreamtime in the Australian Outback, to the Lapis Lazuli mines of Taliban-dominated Afghanistan, to burial tombs along the Silk Road, to relic rooms of ancient Chinese temples, to the mango orchards in rural India, to the ruins of Tyre on the coast of bomb-blasted Lebanon, to insect plantations and tidepools of the Americas, and beyond. It is a colorful journey through time and place."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Color: A Natural History of the Palette"" is a non-fiction book written by Victoria Finlay that explores the history and cultural significance of different colors throughout the world. The book is organized around the colors of the rainbow, with each chapter focusing on a different color and its history. Finlay's writing is engaging and informative, weaving together history, science, and personal anecdotes to create a vivid picture of each color's significance. She explores how different cultures have used and valued different colors throughout history, and how the availability of certain pigments has influenced the development of art and culture. One of the strengths of ""Color"" is Finlay's ability to make the science of color accessible and engaging for a general audience. She explains the chemistry behind each color in a way that is easy to understand, without oversimplifying or talking down to the reader. Another strength of the book is its focus on the cultural significance of color. Finlay highlights how different colors have been valued and used in different cultures, from the ancient Egyptians' use of blue to represent the Nile river, to the traditional red and white colors of Japanese weddings. However, some readers may find the book's structure somewhat repetitive. Each chapter follows a similar format, with Finlay discussing the history and cultural significance of a particular color, followed by a discussion of the pigment's chemical composition and how it was created. Additionally, some readers may find the book's focus on traditional pigments and dyes to be limiting, with little attention paid to contemporary or synthetic colors. Overall, ""Color"" is a well-researched and engaging book that provides a fascinating glimpse into the history and cultural significance of different colors. Its accessible writing style and unique perspective make it a valuable resource for anyone interested in the science and cultural significance of color."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Dyes and pigments have been fairly interesting and important to me for a while--growing up, I lived pretty close to a Williamsburg-like living history museum, where I learned a fair bit about using natural dyes like black walnut and goldenrod that could be found or grown at the museum. Having appreciated them then and having read a book several years ago about the history of (in particular) the red cochineal dye, I was really excited when I learned about this book a while ago. I definitely learned quite a bit about the history of dyes and similar materials from this book. It's arranged thematically by color, which chapters for all the colors of the rainbow as well as brown, black, and white. I think my favorite chapters were probably green, indigo (which has also always been one of my favorite materials to dye with), and purple. The purple chapter, right at the end of the book, was especially interesting to me because I'd known that snails were used for Roman dyes for a long time, and I really enjoyed learning about the process here. Perhaps a major caution or just fyi that I'd like to add to this book, though, which keeps me from wanting to rate it higher is that not all of the book is quite what I'd expected--I'd gone into the book expecting information on the history of colors, which there definitely was, but the book was really more properly half history, half travelogue. Very substantial portions of each chapter are about the author traveling to India or Lebanon or Mexico or China or other places to physically visit places important in the history of different colors' dyestuffs. While I did enjoy parts of this, it really wasn't what I was expecting from the book, and I think I'd have been perfectly happy with a bit more focus on the colors and dyes themselves."
Color: A Natural History of the Palette,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19596.Color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Thanks to Victoria Finlay, for introducing me to Colors, Arts, Paintings, Colors and a new dimension of life. I started seeing colors differently. I came to know colors have royal, historical, religious, geographical, commercial, political connections. The book like a journey with the imaginary Corinthian artist, take the reader through many cities, historic centuries, bring u from clay, Orchy, to Graphite to ink, The Saffron took on a great journey to Europe and Persia. The color India Yellow is so appealing, but the origins are repelling. The first painting is a great revelation. As a Safety Professional, poisonous effects of arsenic contaminated paints was a bit of interest. In Black, I did not know charcoal could be so useful and expensive when checked online the prices. Antimony in eyeliners has encouraged me to stop its use by women around me. Pencils I used from childhood but only this book made me think about its grades. The perfumed ink, for use by scholars, registrar ink for legal documents, I thank the writer for taking me to the sacred caves of Dunhuang. I liked the story of a grandmother artist in Bali who loved her white pigment obtained from rocks she found near her home sea and she kept the secret for whole life. The terrifying journey of a French man to steal trade secrets of the red pigments obtained from a bug, made me realize how tense could be the trade war between china and other big economies. A sentence in orange says, ""Jews were more welcome in Muslim North Africa than in Catholic France"". Whatever I am impressed of the study of Victoria Finlay, who made huge references in history, geography, material, arts, people, books, events etc. She is a genius, though the book is not of my field but she keep amazing me in every paragraph. She is like playing a drama on stage, where she kept me in travel machine from ottoman's era Constantinople to the modern factory of Winsor and newton in London. Finlay taught me that colors and music are interrelated in many forms to violins to nightlife glamourous lights. In green chapter, I liked the idea of connecting green color with luck, with talking fortune, or as anecdote for poison and many other myths. The best part for me as HSE Professional is that Napoleon died of arsenic present in his room paint, made me wondered if we are doing the same mistake while painting our rooms. The green made of some wood was so expensive that it was replaced very rapidly by the synthetic colors. Blue is color of few of the oldest churches in Europe, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan is a major source. A pound of paint made of this valuable stone can be priced at GBP 2500. This is used to paint the beautiful cloths of Sn. Marry, etc. Indigo (Neil as we call it in south Asia), is made from plants juice, I mistakenly thought it as a rock powder, is used for blue color. Indigo is a major product of India (Bengal) and many south American countries. 2 Colors were added to Spectrum by Sir Isaac Newton and the total colors became 7 from 5, indigo was an addition. Violet made from seashell is amazing too, and I learned bees see colors differently than we are, due to the different range of spectrum they can see. Somewhere the English is very hard to understand, tough language with strong background of history, geography needed. I wrote this review and I lost in book so much that I forgot to write the review, Victoria Finley said at end, there is a universe of colors not a world. I would thank the writer once again for her research, passion, study and detail she put into this simplest of topics, I started looking to colors differently. The book may be a cure for color blinds, or color ignorant like me before."

From ancient to modern - it gives a good summary. Not good for in-depth knowledge on specific topics. The broad range of topics led me to do my own research and helped me with Renaissance, Modern and American Art History courses.

Art Through the Ages,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32525.Art_Through_the_Ages/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It has a eurocentric focus, but the amount of work that is covered here is staggering dating back to the hunter gatherer days of our ancestors to contemporary art in the modern world. Art really is the best way to experience culture from around the world across time. Some of the paintings and architecture coming out of Ancient Egypt and Rome in particular were mesmerizing. The level of detail and emotion that we humans have been able to capture through creative work is truly breath taking and is something we can all take pride in as it's part of our heritage as a collective. I truly believe we should all find it within us in our lifetime to contribute to the arts in our own way as it allows us to connect with humanity in a meaningful way to reflect the times that we're in and how we're evolving intellectually. Art has a way of surviving long after we're gone which is a really beautiful thing as the spirit of the artist remains and will continue to inspire. This is a must-have for your bookshelf. 5/5"
Art Through the Ages,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32525.Art_Through_the_Ages/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Art history is a discipline in crisis. This text book shows all the seams. It calls itself ""art through the ages."" It makes a pretense of being global. What it actually deals with is wealthy-white-male European art up until about 1900. Inside of that narrow lens, it can uphold the pretense of a narrative arc. Movements and developments that build upon each other to create one structure, one tradition. The story is in line with a 'Great Man' view of history that unspools with a certain succession of empires and kings and no need to think about the plebes. Just memorize the dates and you're done. But everything outside of that one narrative arc haunts the discipline. Frightened, the editors make nods here and there to art happening in other places. They quickly clear their throats and get us back to Europe. But Europe itself is unspooling. When modern art hits, they lose the thread entirely. They become desperate. In the end, they can only huff and puff about the absurdities of ""multiculturalism."" Within this story of art's history, art is rooted in conquering. Killing animals and humans. Building empire. Celebrating empire. Sometimes something tumbles out from the gaps, even here. Small art, old faces, feathers and fur. Usually they call it ""the grotesque."""

This one covers all of art history (prehistory, through what was then recent in the 1960s/70s) and provides SO MUCH MORE actual historical background on both the history itself, as well as the artists, in addition to the artworks themselves. The pictures are mostly black and white (with color plates), but if you Google the artwork being discussed, you'll benefit even more from the history contained within. It still is awkwardly worded and still doesn't say much, but it certainly says more than the 14th Edition I'm currently using for the second half (Renaissance to 1900) of art history. *edit on May 8* I've now used this book for multiple other classes, aside from art history, namely for mythology and archaeology. Quite indispensable for liberal students... practically all subjects can be tied to art history in some way or another."

It’s definitely a step up from 60’s college art history courses—no thanks to racists like W. H. Hanson, the prior textbook author—but now it’s become the new Hanson. It lacks so much depth with other countries, even though it tries so hard. It suffers from a content problem too, a HUGE one. Whether or not to include new works comes at the cost of having to choose the works that it’ll then replace. Obviously, the editors are gonna keep choosing Loacoan and his Sons over something more unique, contemporary, or—more glaringly—non-western! Pros: Great introduction to the field. Cons: An introduction, and only an introduction. Don’t stop here unless you wanna be like every other tenured white Francophile art history professor."

Art Through the Ages,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32525.Art_Through_the_Ages/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What an amazing book. At 900 pages with a cover made of steel, it’s also able to take multiple consultations over decades. I got this pristine 1980 7th Edition (unfound on Goodreads) for a song. (There’s currently a 16th.) But what makes the book so remarkable is how art reflects the evolution of human perception of our world and ourselves over time. From 17,000 years ago, the hunter-gatherer worship of nature with an almost helpless desire to control it is reflected in the cave paintings of Lascaux, Dordogne, and Trois-Frése, where but a single stick-figure human resides. With a prioritization of strength and aggression, the appearance of troupes or men with bows and arrows appearing to run off for the hunt, battle, or engaged in ritual dance shows the ascent of male forms over female goddess figures by around 8000 B.C. The advent of “observatories” in architecture like Stonehenge where by 2000 B.C. agricultural peoples seek answers from the heavens on when to plant or harvest. Cities without walls become cities with walls as the human population of strangers expands with commensurate threats to us from us. In those cities are carvings and statues that seek to command obedience in an ever more unruly world: horse-drawn chariots with riding kings flinging arrows or wielding an axe to behead those strangers from another city rolled over by his chariot. Validation of the king’s control by reliefs show him with the gods. By now, the goddess is in the background or gone altogether. The ancient Greeks worship not of nature but of man, and his reason dominates their artworks. A return to primitive representations of fearful images returns with the European Dark Ages. With the Axial Age’s turn inward through prayer, meditation, or reason, art takes on otherworldly mysteries of heaven or hell as, eventually, the cathedrals reach for the sky. From the magnificent rediscovery of Greece with the Renaissance to the confusing, disjointed, and intentionally incoherent forms of modern art that can often only shock or repulse, void of talent, these present the rise and fall of human mental landscapes, captured by the art we produced. A salute to Helen Gardner (1878-1946), who published the first edition in 1926."

Janson, the author, expresses different art styles, and how they have changed over time. It helps the readers understand how art reflects the culture of each period. This book contains information about certain events, periods, and different key events in art history. It includes places like Egypt, Greece, and even Italy. The author also hits the different eras and includes the impressionist movement which takes place in France. Finally, it explores modern and contemporary art. You'll learn about famous artists and their artworks from each period. I enjoyed “Art Through the Ages” because it made art history stand out with vivid descriptions and beautiful illustrations. It helped me understand how different art styles evolved. One of my favorite parts in the book was when they were introducing the impressionist movement. I found it interesting how art reflected changes around the world. Overall this book deepened my appreciation and respect for art. In terms of the author's style, what stood out to me most was the book's ability to make art history accessible and engaging. In addition, the book contained vivid descriptions of techniques, artworks, and artists. In my opinion “Art Through the Ages” is a fantastic book for people interested in extending their art background and knowledge.

The Secret Lives of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34122206-the-secret-lives-of-color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Image from Videokarma.org Consider life in black and white. Many creatures have dichromatic vision, (two kinds of cone receptors), which allows limited color perception. Monochromatics see only the gray scale from black to white. (Skates, rays). The cinematic and TV worlds were both certainly B&W for a long time, before color imposed itself on screens large and small. And, while B&W still holds a respected place in the visual arts, particularly in photography, film, and drawing, it is color that holds the broadest appeal, which should not be surprising. Color has played a major role in the development of homo sapiens, giving us more tools for making the best survival decisions. If you are interested in how many colors we can see or the number of colors that exist, you’re gonna need a bigger palette. A computer displays under 17 million colors, of which we can see maybe 10 million, but a conservative estimate of how many colors there actually are puts it at 18 decillion. Yeah, you want to know. That’s an 18 with 33 zeroes after it. The top number is probably infinity, but it feels nice to have an actual number, however extreme, however arbitrary, to define the edges of what there is of anything in the universe. Thankfully, Kassia St Clair trimmed a few off the top, bottom, and middle, settling in at seventy-five. Any of us could name many more, but the odds are we would not be able to expound on each the way Ms. St Clair can. The project began with research on something else entirely, checking out 18th Century fashion intel at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, where she came across some mysterious adjective-noun combinations for the colors of things in fashion, which sparked more research, becoming a column on color in magazine. - From Psychology Today – photo credit – Colin Thomas However minimal seventy-five may sound when compared to the theoretical number of available colors, St Clair has managed to put together a very broad spectrum, including basic Roy G. Biv never heard of, like white, black, and brown. After an introductory section on the science and history of color and seeing, the book is divided into ten parts, white, yellow, orange, pink, red, purple, blue, green, brown and black, with short offerings on between five and ten different colors within each. This makes ideal bedtime reading, as the pieces on any color are never more than two or three pages, (a natural length given that the project originated with a column on color) so you can read as much or as little as you like without any concern about missing something, or delaying your shut-eye with stress over what might happen to a beloved character. The content of the individual chapters varies. Many report on the materials from which coloring agents are made, animal, vegetable, mineral, and weird concoctions. Some focus instead on social significance, and in one case, military impact. It is the range of perspectives that offers the greatest joy here. It is one thing, and not a bad one, to learn where this or that color actually comes from in nature, tossing in some historical or character references, and that could have been pretty much the sum total of the book. But no paint-by-numbers writing here. St Clair’s wide range of approaches keeps us from settling into a single sort of appreciation, like a hamster on a color-wheel. A more descriptive title might have been . Nonetheless, , (which a wonderful world) offers a cornucopia of fascinating bits of information, which makes this a very high fructose collection of brain candy. The cases of Apple computers are actually a shade of gray. Silver was used for flatware in the belief that it could detect poisons. The derivation of orange; which came first, the color or the fruit?

A reason why the blue light from televisions affects us in certain ways. And on and on and on, delightfully. There are words in here that were quite unfamiliar in this context. is a color? Really?

Suffice it to say that this was the most disturbing chapter of the book, one that kept coming back into my thoughts unbidden. Ironically, the pigment was a shade of brown that did not preserve all that well.

Indigo, Prussian, Egyptian, woad, electric, or maybe cerulean? And when you are in a black mood, well, you get the idea. For the truly bleak there is For any who enjoy learning new things, this book is the definition of a fun read, offering fascinating information in bite-sized, tasty nuggets of multi-colored brain candy for your synaptical munching pleasure.

The Secret Lives of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34122206-the-secret-lives-of-color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"However de gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum, in my experience colours, like the weather, can make an convenient topic to spark or rekindle conversation, having saved me a few times in socially awkward situations - as wherever we are, colour is everywhere. Years ago I read Victoria Finlay ‘s which, notwithstanding I learnt a lot from it on the origin of colours, entailed having to wade through numerous pages of rambling self-absorbed travelogue and left me hungry for more substantial information on the world of colours. So when I glanced through in the local library and read in the introduction that Kassia St Clair attempts ‘to provide something between a potted history and a character sketch for the 75 shades that have intrigued her most’, I found myself mouth-watering at some of the delightful names of the colours serving as the titles of the short chapters that structure her book (despite the somewhat silly title). More than a history of colours, this is a compendium of stories, anecdotes and trivia on the 75 hues, tints, tones and shades that St Clair selected, ranging from lead white to pitch black, culled from excursions into history, religion, economics, sociology (the use of Baker-Miller pink to assuage aggressiveness of prisoners), history of art, religion, politics (Mountbatten pink, Dutch orange), biology, chemistry, literature (Celadon). With the same ease St Clair addresses more frivolous subjects like fashion and hair colours (shocking pink, blonde), interior design and poisonous wallpaper (beige, Scheele’s green ) as well as she touches on the meaning of colours in various cultures and centuries, their permanence and provenance or discovery. She delivers clarifications on the etymology of the names of colours and jots in interesting colour-related linguistic musings. The book grew out of the monthly columns on colour she wrote for , and judging from the footnotes, her bite-size entries rely heavily on two sources, by Philip Ball and Victoria Finlay’s and on 's renowned books on colour. There is also an extensive bibliography and list for further reading, and a descriptive list of other interesting shades on which no entry was written and which also speak to the imagination, like Eau de Nil, pompadour, beryl and coquelicot (‘Bright red with a hint of orange, French for Papaver Rhoeas, the wild poppy’). Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato, The Virgin in Prayer (1640-1650) – a tribute to ultramarine Quite some anecdotes I thought well-chosen, fascinating, amusing or surprising, like the one on mummy or Egyptian-brown – and the moment Edward Burne-Jones found out where that fine colour came from: Or this one, on heliotrope, which from one of the few colours Victorian women were allowed to wear during half-mourning, got a distinguished literary afterlife when the observance of mourning dress dictates waned: Having been reading a novella by Turgenev in which heliotrope - the flower, not the colour - announces the (r)emergence of the femme fatale reminded me of St.Clair's findings on the colour of heliotrope. The book doesn’t contain illustrations – which means the reader has to turn to the internet when paintings are discussed - but the outer margin of each page is marked by a strip of the colour at stake in the chapter, so the reader instantly gets an impression of less common hues like isabelline, Napels yellow, verdigris, fallow, gamboge, or Payne’s grey. Jan Van Eyck, Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife (1434) – a dress in the costly verdigris Vividly written, accessible, brimful of informative and fun facts (‘') makes an enthralling (be it somewhat dense) read, however fragmented and in spurs repetitive on the details and cost of extracting and processing pigments for dyeing fabrics and for painting. It is not a book I could gobble up at once and which I found more enjoyable to dip into in between other books, or to read a few pages in to close the day with a moment of beauty. (***½)"
The Secret Lives of Color,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34122206-the-secret-lives-of-color/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"We take colour for granted these days; where ever you look you have garish clothing and brightly painted items competing for attention. But it was never like that, go back several hundred years ago, and lost people wore grey or brown cloth that had been dyed with the ochres and earth colours. Those that had some colour in their lives were the rich; they could afford the purples and reds that adorned their clothes and the rare blues and yellows that graced their artworks. In this fascinating book, St Clair has uncovered the history behind 75 different colour shades and hues and tell their individual story. We find out where in the world these colours originated from, who made them popular, just how expensive a vivid blue like ultramarine was and the chemistry behind turning ground rock into artist’s paint and dyes for cloth. Modern colours are fairly robust, but it is a reminder just how lethal some colours were. The historical account of colour is enlightening too, as we find out which have come into fashion, why some prefer blondes, which colour was behind a notorious seduction and which have remained popular and those that currently don’t fit the bill. Not only is it a nicely written and fascinating book, but it is a beautifully produced book too; each colour group is split into sections and the margins on each page are coloured to match the shade being written about. As you read though each page changes subtly in colour and tone. Just rippling through the pages you transcend from white to yellow to the reds, blues greens and end up at the black, it is a nice effect. The dots on the front are embossed making touching the cover a tactile experience. It was worth reading and would make a good companion volume to Bright Earth: The Invention of Colour by Philip Ball and Colour: A Natural History of the Palette by Victoria Finlay if you already have those."

God, I love it, it's so true. Haaa. Well, it's pretty obvious, we all differ not only in seeing colours but in many more abilities or senses. But the colour is probably one of the most visible (obviously) things, since the first time someone pointed at something, saying, oh look, a gold dress with brown (or whatever) stripes and his friend said, no no, it's a brown one with violet stripes... And some other person would say - gosh, who cares about colours of gowns anyway? Rather say, if you hear that song by the Beatles? I feel it's orange... with parmesan... I have a long and complicated relationship with colours. When I was a kid I loved drawing and when picking a color of a marker I was usually so overwhelmed and confused by the hues and shades that in the end I was coloring everything in black. Black is still my numero uno, undeniable alpha & omega of colours, like it or not. But I also have a deep fascination for other colours wherever they occur, be it art, fashion or nature. So if you also care about the colours, you should definitely read this book! It's full of so many interesting facts from various branches of science - chemistry, biology, history, history of art, philosophy, even psychology and medicine. It took me quite a couple of months to finish it because of this overload of facts. Not to mention the colours themselves. Actually, some of them were not even what I imagined them to be! Some of them were never heard of (by me of course), like Isabelline for example (it's a shade of white), or Gamboge (it's a sort of yellow), or Mountbatten pink, which doesn't even look like pink and would definitely unnerve Barbie. Also I realized that I'm a blue lover, since I knew all the shades by their names. OK, not you, Woad. Also, all my life I was thinking that Khaki was a shade of green when in fact it was a shade of brown!!! Shocking!!! And finally I discovered that my favourite shade of grey is called Payne's grey, by the name of the painter who actually produced it for the first time, but alas, was long forgotten since. Gosh, I did love this book, didn't I? Anyway, read it for the knowledge and entertainment, get ready for a lot of googling and trust me, it's going to be interesting!"

Each color has a very short account that ranges from explaining the original chemical/mineral composition of the color to explaining the status the color signified throughout civilization. For instance, the color blue’s transformation from being the most undesirable color to the most popular. Or, that chochineal required 70,000 dried bugs for a pound of color.

The color entries for the most part don’t even qualify as essays; there’s not any kind of arc or conclusion or lesson drawn. This book is the written equivalent of sitting at a long dinner next to somebody who knows a lot of color trivia. And the thing is, I love trivia. But it turns out I have an upper limit on my tolerance for a diet of unalleviated trivia on colors."

What about why Van Gogh's sunflowers are slowly wilting as the years pass? Are you curious why some colors are considered royal? If you answer ""yes"" to any of these questions, you should give this book a go. An interesting glimpse into the history and changing meaning of color over time. The exact dialog about each color varied, with some focusing heavily on the historical recipe and how that was interesting, and others narrowing in more on the social constraints, focusing on the meaning of the color to people of that time. Overall a good read with lots of fun period specifics. Due to the nature of the content, and not being an artist and therefore more interested in the science angle, certain portions were a little dry but the work as a whole was worth the short bouts of disinterest. This would be an excellent companion to , where we look at the aftermath of the color revolution here in the US. would also be a great consecutive read for those interested in how the demand for synthetic dyes launched the profession of chemistry, and resulted in the pharmaceutical industry. I would also recommend reading on a tablet capable of color, as there are examples of the colors throughout the book, which I felt added to the experience."

The end result? A book full of piecemeal information suitable for party chatting without organized idea or purpose. The amount of good reviews is a testimony of either the shallowness of our time, or the deluge of fake reviews. Hopefully it's the latter. : I'd recommend for a deeply contemplative and culturally spectral alternative. Much less color names, much more colors."

The book is divided into short stories on each color, filled with details about how they were made and used throughout history. Before reading this book, I never gave much thought to all the colorful pigments we use in our daily lives, taking them rather for granted. This book's deeper look has made me realize that for much of history, it was difficult, expensive, and sometimes harmful to get even a little color into people's lives. This applied to all the great artists too, who had to be competent colorists in addition to artists in order to create their masterpieces. Since this book is filled with lots of information, I found it best to read it slowly with a computer nearby. Whenever new colors or artwork is mentioned, I found it useful to look them up as I'm reading along so that I could get a more complete visual understanding."

Very interesting to see how rocks, minerals, sea creatures were used to create the colours and how through the many years going all the way back many centuries to the current times these colours were used to determine the various classes of wealth. I read this because at the beginning of the year there was a TV segment on ""relaxing and soothing colours"". Depending on the website you look at, the number can range from 7 to 16. The one I looked at had nine; Blue, Violet, Pink, Green, Gray, Tan, White and Yellow, though it did not go into a specific shade of each colour.

My problem was that it was boring and monotonous even though I am interested in the topic, the writing wasn't captivating either. Also, some important shades weren't talked about such as turquoise or lilac or lemon yellow or coral or many others. One other issue I had is that the book didn't talk about the meaning of colours??? I mean for the colour green she only talked about the negatives of it although green is a positive colour, she needed to state both the positives and negatives of each colour. The good things were that it was well-researched and the book talked about cultures relating to each colour."

Each vignette is short-usually a page or two-making this a great book to dip into in those spare moments that are too brief to allow for full immersion in a story world. The author sometimes goes off on tangents that seem only barely related to the color in question, and the pages were a bit uneven-some stories leapt off the page and dazzled like the brightest vermilion, while others were drier and more muted, more like the terre verte that has historically left artists indifferent and apathetic. Still, on the whole, I enjoyed the read, and the fact that I read through the glossary of ""other interesting colors"" wishing that St. Clair had dedicated full pages to these, too, bespeaks the fact that the book was, ultimately, successful in keeping my interest. 3.5 stars"

The author has combined her twin passions for color and fashion and mixed them together with history, art and chemistry to provide a delectable collection of morsels about where colors we might not think twice about first appeared in the human story, and how they and their making evolved over time. I found this book on the ""Staff Picks"" shelf of our local independent bookstore and flipped it open to the pages on Tyrian Purple, Cleopatra's favorite color. In less than three pages, I learned about the labor intensive and incredibly stinky process used to manufacture this hue from the secretions of a Mediterranean mollusk nearly wiped out by the process, with a reported 250,000 animals required to make one garment. The process was so expensive that even a Roman emperor claimed to not be able to afford to buy his wife a Tyrian dress. Though not all colors in the book had such famous admirers, I found the stories behind even the blandest of shades to be endlessly fascinating. Having grown up in a world where the magic of chemistry puts most all shades of color within ordinary reach, being briefly sent back to a time where that was not the case made me appreciate the rainbow around me in a way that I haven't in years."

Who knew that painting in the olden days required considerations such as making sure your paints didn’t react with each other and burn a hole in the canvas? Our brains normally collect and apply cues about the ambient light and texture. We use these cues to adjust our perception, like applying a filter over a stage light. The poor quality and lack of visual clues like skin colour in the dress image meant that our brains had to guess at the quality of the ambient light. Some intuited that the dress was being washed out by strong light and therefore their minds darkened the colours, others believed the dress to be in shadow, so their minds adjusted what they were seeing to brighten it and remove the shadowy blue cast. There are two different types of colour mixing: additive (light) and subtractive (paints). Because each paint pigment absorbs a different set of wavelengths of light, mix enough pigments together and they absorb every wavelength, becoming brown then black. Mixtures generally become dull and murky compared to single pigments. Colours should be understood as subjective cultural creations: you could no more meaningfully secure a precise universal definition for all the known shades than you could plot the coordinates of a dream. The Golden Gate Bridge had its colour chosen so as to blend in with the hills but pop against the sea and sky. The rusty shade is now called GGB International Orange. The Dutch flag would have had orange in it, but no one could find a dye sufficiently colourfast, the orange strip either faded to yellow or deepened to red. So by the 1660s the Dutch gave up and began using red instead. Before the late 1700s pink referred to a kind of pigment, consisting of a colourant (e.g. buckthorn berries) added to an inorganic substance like chalk to give it body. Apparently the colour Baker-Miller pink (aka drunk-tank pink) could sap the strength of even the toughest man. Then (Pre-revolutionary France), as in now, indulging in the latest fashion trends signaled status, wealth and a sense of tribal belonging in the jeweled echo chamber of the French royal court. In 1999 red appeared in 74% of the world’s flags, making it by far the most popular colour to exemplify a nation’s identity. Prussian blue was used by John Herschel in combination with photosensitive paper to make a proto-photocopy. The resulting white marks on a blue background gave rise to the term ‘blueprint’. Sepia photographs came about as squid ink was used to replace the silver in the silver-based prints with a more stable compound."

Others are Many Small Idea books (especially collections of essays). This books is of an a different kind, unless you think that a color is an idea. Whatever the name is for the profession where you make sure that the printing doesn't mess up the colors, they must have been ecstatic about getting this job. Every 2-3 pages is a different color, and in a roughly one-inch column down the outer edge of each page is a band of color, illustrating what we are talking about. Madder. Indigo. Cochineal. Khaki. Taupe. The colors are organized by what general part of the color spectrum we're on (all the reds together, all the oranges, etc.), so the edge of the book is a sort of linear rainbow. Much of the discussion of each color is about the history of how the pigment came to be first discovered (or, in some cases, it seems more appropriate to say ""invented"", as the process for many of them was elaborate and laborious). There is also, of course, some discussion about how it is (or was) used. Julius Caesar and Tyrian purple; Queen Victoria and jet black; vermillion in the ""Villa of Mysteries"" in ancient Pompeii. Not so much attention is paid, by most of us, nowadays, to the ability to conjure up (in pigment or on the computer screen) any color we can see. For most of human history, it was not so. The discovery of a new pigment could set off something akin to the modern high-tech frenzies around smartphones, electric scooters, or Bitcoin. Many shades passed from rare and thus expensive and thus prestigious, to more plentiful but still prestigious and thus overused, to out of fashion and somewhat gauche. This is the sort of book which I enjoy a nibble at a time, like the jar of chocolate treats which you need to limit yourself to a modest amount of each day. Most often, I read only a single color per day (along with examining its associated column of pigment on the outer edge of the page). When it was gone, I wished there were more."

Each color has a two page description and though interesting the history is quite random - much like my notes below. Here are notes from some of the chapters that I found interesting. 1. Lead White - this poisonous pigment was the most widely used white pigment until 1913 when Titanium White was introduced. Lead poisoning was most common among those who created the pigment from chemical reactions around the lead ingots and those women who used it in makeup 2. Whitewash - is made from crushed limestone or lime, salt, and water 3. Isabelline - a pale yellow color said to be named after duchess Isabella from Spain and her underwear which went unwashed during a three month siege. It is now associated with several bird species and sickly penguins 4. Chalk - chalk is formed from ancient one celled alga 5. Naples Yellow - was the most popular yellow painter's pigment until the 20th century. Cezanne was a fan. It has a tendency to turn black if exposed to the elements 6. Chrome Yellow - this was Van Gogh's favorite yellow pigment and what he used for his sunflowers 7. Gold - some European painters used gold gilding in their paintings or frames but it was of course very expensive 8. Orange - orange as a color only emerged in the 16th century 9. Saffron - is one of the official colors of India's national flag. Saffron is made from the stamens of the flower and it takes approximately 40,000 flowers to make a pound of the pigment and has to be done by hand, making it very expensive 10. Mountbatten Pink - this reddish hue was used during WWII to camouflage British ships 11. Fuchsia - the flower that makes up this pigment was not found until 1702 in the Caribbean 12. Scarlet Red and Cochineal Red - both pigments came from different insects 13. Tyrian Purple - this royal hue comes from the mixture of two types of specific Mediterranean shellfish species 14. Indigo - known for centuries it was valued more than gold (on a per oz basis) and of the several plants that can create indigo most were found in the new world, so many of the Spanish ships contained indigo rather than gold 15. Khaki - this word popularized by the British uniform color worn in WW1 is an Urdu word that means dusty 16. Fallow - a tawny caramel color that is one of the oldest colors in the English language 17. Sepia - is named after a species of cuttlefish and its ink is a brown color"

The many 2-3 minute chapters are generally entertaining and informative. At first I thought the book would be solely about how artists made or obtained particular paint colors hundreds of years ago. There's a bit of that, and it's interesting enough, but fortunately the book mostly consists of mini-histories and cultural asides. Black and its assorted shades are covered in the final section and here the author seemed to run out of steam. Maybe it was the color itself that brought about lackluster material or perhaps it was just a case of the limits of expanding magazine articles into a book but in any event I'm glad the book wasn't longer. (Unrelated to the subject matter but a book I liked a lot that evolved from a magazine article, and would recommend, is The World in a Grain by Vince Beiser.) Besides its own entertainment value this book may be useful in leading the reader to books that cover subjects of interest in actual detail. One chapter (Cobalt) lightly touched on the subject of a book I enjoyed (The Forger's Spell by Edward Dolnick) and would recommend. Bonus for Steely Dan fans: There are multiple mentions of the cave(s) of Altamira. Not the song, just the real cave. I'd never seen it referenced before and got a kick out of its multiple mentions. While I'm in the recommending spirit please check out the song if you can spare three and a half minutes; it's a hidden gem."

But have you ever thought about how every colour has a history of its own? I've got to admit – I have not. is here to unravel a lot of the mysteries surrounding some of our most beloved and least preferred hues. Collecting 75 stories, Kassia St. Clair shares some anecdotes and developments these shades encompass and represent. The book starts out with some technical explanation about the nature of colours, how we perceive them and how they come into existence. Following that there are ten different parts (, , , , , , , , and ), divided further into five different shades. The stories about each shade are short and sweet, making this a lovely read to dive in and out of. Did you know for example that Isabelline (a pale grey-yellow), which is pretty much the colour of dirt, has gotten its name from Isabelline, who was the wife of Archduke Albert VII of Austria? When the latter began a siege, his wife was said to having promised not to change her underwear until he returned. When the siege ended three years later, her underwear ended up looking like what we now know as . There are various colours that used to be called something else or names that used to describe a different shade than we think of now. There are also differences in languages, as Russian for example has two different words for light and dark blue. There is also controversy around particular shades, most notably what we like to call . While fashion had its fun with it, its recently fallen from grace as more and more people have started to think of the label as racist, since it's only truly for a very limited range of people. This was a fun read from which I learned a lot of interesting little bits of information that I previously had not been aware of. It's not particularly deep or challenging, but sometimes that's not what you're looking for, anyway."

The preface makes me think that it should also have 'science' and of course it should have 'history.' Also, my library shelved at 155.9114... 'art history' is 709, 'memory' and 'logic' bracket 155, hmm... 'psychology, adult' is at 155.6 so now we're getting somewhere, as I can see this being thought of as a psychology book because stuff like 'warm' and 'cool' colors is psychology (and tradition, and education).... I don't know. If you're a nerd like me about Dewey Classification, do you know what other books have been tagged 155.9? I did find this interesting list: . Oh, just looked at it further and see 'stress' at 155.9042. Double hmm.... Anyway, the preface is comparatively extensive, but very readable. The book design is lovely, with fairly heavy paper, no dust jacket, plenty of appendices. I'm going to enjoy this read. :) ----- I'd be enjoying it more if it were a coffee-table book, as it turns out. Too many references to works of art that I'll have to look up online. The various shades of white are shown on white pages, and are therefore darker than true. Other light colors are (or at least appear to be) darker than I know. I looked ahead to khaki and it's shown not as the color of Dockers' trousers, but much closer to a warm chocolate. Other examples don't match what I would define, either. Oh well; I guess I'm reading for the information. ----- Welp, as I read along, I discover it is mostly about art, and the connections of art to fashion and history. The science, in the colors, is about how the pigments and dyes are made... so, usually, chemistry. An awful lot of them were killers: either of insects, or farmers, or artists.... or all of the above. It's kinda like a trivia book, but the factoids aren't as trivial, and there is, obviously, an organizational pattern. Cool book for nerds who don't have a lot of experience with colors but I suspect people in the arts and professions would be more 'meh' and even nitpicky. ----- Skips gray! There's a very dark ""Payne's Gray"" in the section on black, but no dove gray or fog or anything. Not in the index, not in the 'additional interesting colors' appendix, nowhere. Well, except for in the text itself, as it's used to modify so many other colors, such as a grayish purple or a grayed green or whatever. Author credits Qadi Ahmad with ""the ink of the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr"" but it's also said to be one of the ""hadiths"" ... don't ask me; I just like it as an Islamic version of ""the pen is mightier than the sword."" An interesting thing I didn't know is that the Greek and Roman 'ruins' were originally painted. The ""bleached bone"" aesthetic is basically a mistake. Remember, not too long ago, when ""flesh"" and ""nude"" were colors? For a gorgeous, revelatory, and important counter to that, check out the works at . I dunno what to rate this.

Take white, which begins with a quote from Moby Dick. Page through to one of white's constituent colors, Isabelline (passing ivory and whitewash, among others). Probably apocryphal but still delightful, albeit with a high factor. How about red, which begins with a 2012 anecdote when waitresses were advised to wear red. It is also the color of power and war (redcoats, anyone?). Scarlet, the first of its constituent colors, is a particularly schizophrenic hue. In 1587 Mary Queen of Scots wore black to the scaffold where she stripped to an undergown of bright scarlet. Her supporters saw it as a symbol of her martyrdom; her detractors as an outward manifestation of the biblical Whore of Babylon. [SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: The reading of this book may cause whiplash.] And then there is my favorite color, green, for which the ancient Egyptians used the hieroglyphic for papyrus (a huge cash crop for both Pharaohs and Ptolemies, and I'm kinda wondering if that has anything to do with the color of American money today. There's that pyramid on the one dollar bill...). Over the ages green was one of the more difficult colors for artisans to produce, in part because of unions.

A good balance of scientific and sociological information makes this a user-friendly volume. Many extra colors are referenced in the Glossary in less detail. While many colors are familiar, some are nearly unknown today. It’s well known that purple and red were royal colors off-limits to peasants throughout European history, but who knew that yellow books were considered unseemly and obscene in Victorian times? Or that Scheele’s green, a popular shade for wallpaper in the 1800s, contained enough arsenic in a 6-inch square to poison 2 adults? And that it was also used in dressmaking? Or that Mountbatten pink was successfully used on ship hulls for camouflage in early WWII, protecting ships at their most vulnerable times of day? Or that Isabelline, a grayish coffee au lait color, was named for a rumor about a beautiful queen’s underwear? Or that early Impressionists were accused of “violettomania” by the mainstream? Or that there’s a color named mummy, made from—you guessed it. There’s plenty to learn from this whimsical and informative book, with just enough detail about each color to be interesting but not overdone. Highly recommended."

The Secret Lives of Color provides illuminating and epic accounts of the origins of the colors we see in the world, drawing on nature and scientific discoveries, political and historical events, and even religion and mythology. It was so grounding to read especially today when every color known to man can seemingly be plotted neatly into a cluster of pixels and a hex code. This book made me think of how color is one of the most elusive phenomena to exist. Any given color can never be described or accounted for exactly. Color can be perceived differently by every eye and can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways, depending on who you ask. The only other thing I can think of that’s the same way would be the supernatural or the mystical, which we don’t quite experience in our physical world. But color, on the other hand, we get to experience everyday. How lucky of us."

After the introductory essays, we have dozens of short essays -- one per color -- on the history, the method of production, the place in society, literature and art, and even the way the name of the color has been absorbed into our language. Each essay ends in a bright point, not unlike old Andy Rooney at the end of the 60 Minutes show. So this was, for me, a big bowl of after-dinner mints rather than a meal. It does stretch the reader's imagination regarding colors, which made it nice gift for me, a newcomer to visual arts. I wouldn't be surprised to find it better in reflection (no pun intended) over time: like vigorously turning over the soil, it may feel pointless at the time, but prove valuable in the long run."

I loved this beautiful little book. Kassia St. Clair is a talented writer, and it is a charming, rambling history of color and the human passion for it.

The book itself is lovely, true to its topic, with wide margins of the color in discussion on each page, and a fun multi colored hardcover design. The author has clearly researched well, in a book full of historical anecdotes carefully cited via footnotes to pages of sources in the back. There's a wide range of colors represented, of both natural and human-made origin, for shades historic and/or contemporary, and there's even a few pages at the end of the book that lists 'honorary mention' colors that weren't featured with an essay of their own, but are worth noting anyway. Given the many small segments, this would be a good book to read in chunks when you might be interupted frequently or only have short periods of time to read, as each essay on a color stands independently, with only the occasional reference to another shade in the book. But it can also be read in larger chunks of time, which allows one to see patterns emerging and start to recognize some recurring themes and facts in the world of color. I feel like I learned so much reading this book, about colors and the world that shaped and reflected them. I'd definitely recommend this for a light non fiction read."

I can't bring myself to continue. Basically it doesn't feel worthwhile. The ""chapters"" on each color are too short, which makes everything so disparate. I wish the stories intersected more. Possibly fewer colors with more detailed histories. This book is very cursory and reads like it was meant to sit on a coffee table and not actually give you any meaningful historical knowledge. It saddens me because I love the idea behind this book! Also, the design is outstanding. It probably is meant to sit about and look pretty, whereas I was reading it with an ""art history"" expectation."

The Secret Lives of Color is an exquisite compilation of interesting historical facts about many colors you know and perhaps a few you have never heard of (""mummy"" came as a surprise to me when I hit the section devoted to browns). If I had only read a St. Clair book half a lifetime ago, I would surely have been the life of every party, regaling the other guests with fascinating tidbits about the color of the wallpaper in the room where Napoleon died and the composition of the kohl ancient Egyptians smeared around their eyes.

Delightful anecdotes and tidbits are included. I will return to it from time to time. I suggest the print versions of this book over the ebook, because each page shows the color being discussed on the outer edges of each page, like giant tabs.

The Secret Lives of Color explores the histories and usages of various colors. If you've ever wondered what color was named after a fly's underbelly, yet achieved the coveted status of being a favorite of Marie-Antoinette's; what shade was painted on prison walls to minimize violence; or what dye William Morris favored for pranking guests, you've come to the right book. (Puce, Baker-Miller pink, and woad, respectively.) Even if you, like me, did not wonder about such trivia before, but still enjoy the type of book that will make you a scintillating dinner party guest, St. Clair has something for you. St. Clair explores histories of color, going back centuries to primary source material, mining historical fashion, interior design, industry, art, politics, and more. I've rarely heard academic studies of color outside advertising, and the occasional ""what does the appearance of color mean in this text?"" It was fun reading about color outside these contexts, and seeing how pervasive and meaningful color has been in human history. I recall visiting castles in England, weathered to a uniform gray, and learning that they would have been painted bright colors in medieval times. The physical book itself is as appealing as the information inside. Each color has its own spread, with the pages edged in the color, so the fore-edge is a delightful rainbow. The reproductions of the colors are not exact, but enough to evoke the original color until I looked up actual representations of the color. While the printing quality is wonderful, only so much can be done without making the cost of the book prohibitive. St. Clair includes a glossary of colors that don't get a full spread in the main text. While the book itself is organized by the order of the rainbow, this glossary is alphabetical, a strange choice. The index and references include small dots of color, making those portions of the book visually appealing, too. A treat for the eyes as well as the trivialist, brings some colorful life to a dull and dreary world."

Silver - In Scottish folkore, silver branches adorned by silver apples or by white blossoms were seen as a ""passport to the fairyworld"".

Isabelline - Named after the colour of Queen Isabella of Austria's underthings after she stopped washing them during a siege - which lasted 3 years lovely Electric Blue - A person working at Chernobyl on the night it exploded said that they were running out of the building when they saw the radiation and noticed it was a beutiful light-electric blue colour. yay also fun fact Chernobyl happened on the 26th of April Mummy - A brown paint made from... wait for it... actual MumMY bones. like, ew."

Each section focuses on a particular color and then several shades within that color family. They were all short (none longer than three pages) so it was easy to squeeze in a few chapters during the day. I had a physical copy and it was beautiful!

Great as both an audible and a physical book, but I’d recommend stretching it over time as each color is its own little story to be savored.

I was unaware of most of the information I learned from this book, which covers 75 colors, shades, and hues and shares fascinating stories and facts about each. The book is divided into broad color families. A section is dedicated to each — white, yellow, orange, pink, red, purple, blue, green, brown, black — with chapters within each section that discuss variations of the particular color. For example, the first color discussed is white. First, we get an overview of the color as an introduction to the section, and then we begin a chapter on a variation/type of the color. The first is lead white, the second chapter is on ivory, and the third is about silver. The amount of chapters in each section varies, but the chapters are no more than three or four pages, and each page contains a simple border in the color being discussed. The book is easy to navigate and is a quick read as well. Actually, St. Clair first began writing about color as a column for the British Elle Decoration in 2013, which I think shows because the chapters seem to have retained the flavor of a magazine column making them quick, snappy reads and compelling despite the wealth of information. Typically, I hate having to refer to endnotes because of the extra work of having to flip to the back of the book, but it was worth doing so in this one. Some readers ignore these calls to digress from a sentence or paragraph, but I encourage you to do so if you decide to read this book for the extra information provided. Obviously, I enjoyed and treasure this book, which I consider a favorite. St. Clair writes that this book “is not intended to be an exhaustive history” of color, but it’s certainly a great one that can also be used as a reference. • There’s a type of brown called mummy that is actually made from mummies. It’s also called Egyptian brown and Caput mortum (“dead man’s head”), and was used as paint from the 12th to the 20th centuries. • Apparently, ancient Egyptians unknowingly staved off eye infections by using kohl to outline their eyes. • A lot of pee went into making colors and dyes back in the day. • Pink – Baker-Miller pink, to be exact – can apparently weaken a man. • Cochineal is made from an insect – Dactylopius coccus – which has “made and felled kings and empires, and helped shape history.” • Blue was once considered a warm color. • Couple years ago, back in 1893, pink was for boys and blue for girls. It’s such a good read and so informative too. I HIGHLY recommend it. I read it on and off over a couple months (it’s not long, 320 pages max) but whenever I returned to the book, I was always hooked and hated parting from it for long."

Organized by broad color category, and further split into color-shades, this book gives a short and sweet overview of the history or use or recipe (depending on what's most interesting) of 75 colors. Perfect for anyone who likes a little bit of history/chemistry/psychology/everything, or anyone who likes obscure knowledge, or anyone who just likes pretty colors. The chapters were very short but packed with fascinating information, so I never lost interest. And at the end of a chapter I often wanted to share the crazy fact I just learned. Not too in-depth, but a great introduction to the world of color. I would highly recommend to anyone who's even the slightest bit interested in the book description, it's definitely worth it."

Vibrant and full of colorful pages (really, pages blocked out entirely in color) precede and follow short essays on particular shades.

There is no one formula for each of St. Clair's profiles. Run into chemistry or biology in one, run into anthropology or psychology in another (or some combination). St. Clair is an engaging writer. Whether you read all the way through or only read colors that catch your eye, this book is easy to stop and start."

I didn't mind the art history aspect much, but the actual production/use of the colors in painting got tedious for me. Fortunately, each color received at most four pages of text. This would be most useful as a resource guide if one wanted to find an exact color name needed for a project, as not only are multiple colors discussed, but there is a glossary of additional colors in the back. My favorite aspect of the book was that the edges of each page were dyed the color that was being discussed. It makes even the paperback a lovely book, and added to the discussion of each color. I'm only giving it three stars b/c again, it is best as a reference guide, not as an afternoon read."

Clear confirmation of my love of facts. It appealed to me in much the same way as Bill Bryson and Annie Dillard, who both drop countless gems seemingly effortlessly, on so many topics that I can't help but be in awe. All three authors have this ability to tell a story about something historical or scientific that I've never heard of before, and make it seem so important that I can't believe I've never heard of it before. In addition to historical accounts, I learned more about painting, cloth dyeing, animals, precious stones and substances, geography, chemical reactions, and even urine. In the modern day it's kind of hard to imagine how difficult it was to come across all these different pigments in the past. And how dangerous in some cases. We can go to any store and pick up a box of 24 or 48 or 96 crayons or colored pencils for just a few bucks, and none of them will kill us. But the scientists, painters, cloth makers, and alchemists of past centuries had to figure out all of that on their own. I gained many, many interesting details from this book--too many to count. Some that stick out as notable are how color was associated with status or power. Some people weren't allowed to, or were required to, wear certain shades. Also, the number of colors that have been fatal or at least dangerous is larger than I realized."

The chapters are white, yellow, orange, pink, red, purple, blue, green, brown, and black. Each chapter starts with a two page spread of the color with some variety of tone and hue - like a extract from a massive color wheel) and a three to four page history/commentary about that specific family. Then 6 - 8 members of that color family with two to four pages of interesting history as well a thick strip of color on each outside margin of that 'sub-chapter'. To give an example: under Purple is Tyrian purple, Archil, Magenta, Mauve, Heliotrope, and Violet. Under Green is Verdigris, Absinthe, Emerald, Kelly Green, Scheele's Gree, Terre Verte, Avocado and Celadon. Then there are the fun colors that St. Clair added in the ending glossary like Livid (sort of a bruise-color); Chartreuse (a pale yellow-green); Nymphea (mid-pinkish purple); Quimper (soft cornflower blue like dusk); Oxblood (dark rust-red) and many more. I have to admit I will likely always remember the color puce - part of the pink family - as the story goes that King Louis XVI was watching his wife trying on a new dress that was a brown-pink-gray. Many would have called it 'faded rose' but he called it 'the color of fleas'. Yep, puce is flea-color. 2020-108"

I anticipated, based on the podcast, that this book would include interesting symbolism of colors in our everyday lives. I was hoping for a contemporary application of color in art and life. Perhaps that's why I was disappointed. I found this book to be too history-heavy, focused too much on the process of making the specific colors long ago. All the many, many, many various ingredients ran together in my mind, and the main takeaway was that producing colors was difficult, smelly, and expensive. But I had already learned that by the first five or six shades, so seventy-five just made it a bit dull. The most interesting part for me was the beginning, where it talked about color theory. I wanted more about what colors meant in art and I wanted more anecdotes about art in fashion, marketing, or design."

With additive mixing, different light wavelengths are combined to create different colours, and when added together the result is white light. This is what Newton demonstrated with his prisms. However, the opposite happens when paints are mixed. Since each pigment only reflects back to the eye a proportion of the available light, when several are mixed together more and more wavelengths are subtracted. Mix enough together and very little of the visible spectrum is reflected, so we will perceive the mixture to be black, or very close to it.’"

It has a mid-white background and it looks like someone paper punched holes in it then added different colors behind each hole. It’s lively and lovely and makes me want to smile. But I love COLOR! I’m an artist and I knit and enjoy home decor. The first thing that catches my eye in anything is the color and its distribution and relationships. I thoroughly enjoyed my color theory classes in college and the things I learned in them have stayed with me still. So have my textbooks. Josef Albers wrote the book on color and it’s still the book. Ms. St. Clair has done a wonderful job of researching and digging out the details on the stories behind these colors. She has shared them in a format that I would think most people would be comfortable with. Each chapter is from 6 to 9 colors that flow from one to the next, each one having its own 2-3 page story. For instance, one chapter covers Blonde, Lead-tin yellow, Indian yellow, Acid yellow, Naples yellow, Chrome yellow, Gamboge, Orpiment, Imperial yellow, and Gold. Along the edge of the page of each color is the color itself, which is also used for the color of the text for the color listing of the chapter. Each color title is printed in its own color. Just a little detail, but it’s that sort of thing that makes it special. I was given a copy in hardcover as a gift for Christmas as I noted above. The book has a wonderful feel in your hands. The book has weight, which makes you subconsciously think it holds knowledge or secrets. And it holds both. The cover has a smooth feeling, but then your finger sticks on one of the colored holes! The paper used for the printing is heavy and feels nice in the hand. It feels like important documents with a little luxurious touch. Penguin has done a wonderful job in the presentation of this book. And the author has written such wonderful content. Her story on Lead-tin yellow starts out this way: “There are many art world mysteries: the identity of Vermeer’s Girl with the Pearl Earring; the whereabouts of Caravaggio’s Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence; who pulled off the 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist, to name but a few. One that has attracted little popular attention, and has yet to be completely solved, is the curious case of the yellow that …” So, who would want to read this book and what would it be used for? Well, one other reviewer said it could be used for time on the toilet because of its short sections. Yes, that would work, I suppose. Another suggested it for a coffee table book despite its minimal size. I certainly agree with that. It could be used in a college color class as recommended reading. It could be used in an art history class for that matter. It has a solid bibliography and some suggested reading even. Or if you’re just crazy about color, you could buy it and read it, and fall in love with it! I highly recommend it!"

It is not a novel and not an autobiography or biography. It is the history of the backstory to art. It is a conglomeration of all that has gone into the development of color, paints, dyes and pigments of all sorts. Not something that would come to mind when one is walking through an art gallery or printing something from a computer. This book brings all sorts of thoughts and tells a tale about how something simple becomes complex over time. I have had a dream of taking time to use plant dyes and make some prints or a tie dye from some white articles of clothing, or doing batik, etc. just for my own pleasure. This made me see how this has been going on for years and people have made a living out of being a colorist, dyer, or paint developer. Starting with the basic dyes found in nature and expanded. This is a book which every artist might find surprising and engrossing. There are so many small stories about just how a specific color came to be. It is a fascinating story about chemistry and the natural world. Also about how abundance or scarcity of basic materials affect how the general populace views a newly developed color and it may become a staple over long periods of time like indigo, or not used, liked, or appreciated over time for a variety of reasons. I realized how there might be so many, many ingredients in just one color: things like flowers, plants, rocks, minerals, mud, dung, urine, wax, arsenic, bugs, and more. How color is restricted by law to be worn by only people of status, or how certain occupations are required to wear certain colors. The popularity of certain paints or colors might be based on the ""fastness"" of a color when dying cloth or the longevity of a color on a painting over time, especially when mixed with oils or alcohols as used to create the best hue for the feeling of a picture. So much in such a simple and complex book. It seemed best taken in small sections so the things that are brought to mind may be absorbed and savored."

It’s geography, economy, art, society, geology, culture. St. Clair explains the origins of various shades of every color with fantastic detail, intriguing anecdotes, and a sprinkle of humor. I was expecting a weighty collection of dates and names and details, and all of those elements are there, but it’s a light, easy-to-digest collection. Everything is fascinating—ancient Egyptian burials to the plague to George Washington’s love for blue and beige to Monet to Chinese emperors’ robes to WWI military uniforms to cave dweller handprints to the 1960s avocado obsession—all of it informs as it entertains. Intensely and thoroughly researched, the stories of colors such as mauve, topaz, Kelly green, crimson, Prussian blue, charcoal, and so many other hues as St. Clair tells them are engaging and enlightening. Don’t think of this book as a dry, textbook-style conglomeration of facts. It is, instead, a glimpse into the world of color typically experienced solely by artists and their pigment suppliers. And not only is it interesting—it’s also beautiful. The layout of this book is colorful and expands the margins, making each page an easy read, while also packing so much information in-between the edges that it feels you’ve absorbed an entire anthropology and history book. All of her sources are cited, so you can verify what you’ve read, and she offers additional suggested reading if you’re so inclined. An index of even more colors is included in the back, complete with color dots for reference.

I looked up the companion document online to see the color bars it talked about, but I really think this would would be best in a physical book, and especially the kind that you just keep on your coffee table and read a few pages here and there. Trying to read it straight through to finish in time for a library deadline also dampened the experience, as did the fact that it felt like no matter how many times I picked it up I wasn’t making any progress—but the main text of the book actually ended at 60% on my Kindle, so I was further along than I thought. Every little section is incredibly well-researched and well-written, so I honestly have no criticism of the book itself, but for me it just felt like it was a bit difficult to get through and after a while felt more like a project than a joy. I think for a book like this, your reading experience will have EVERYTHING to do with the format you read it in. Go for the hard copy. One of the most interesting things for me from the book as a whole was that I’d never really thought before about how so many pigments were dangerous or difficult to make, were expensive to acquire, or wouldn’t last properly. I’ve grown up in the era of Crayola and could obtain any color of crayon, pencil, marker, or paint that I wanted, plus I’ve never tried to make an artwork that might last hundreds of years, so there was just so much here that I had never really considered before. I’m even more impressed now at how much artwork has survived."

She explained that some people preferred muscles and some bones and others made their own mummies. What? Why would all 3 get the same color? But she didn’t bother to explain why mummies made this color! She just drops it and on to another color. I was also annoyed when she failed to make relevant cultural connections. So Buff is a color that was often associated with being naked, she explains and the. It’s off to talking about military uniforms (for the umpteenth time) instead of addressing the glaringly obvious and more interesting question of why buff means nude white folks and how our cultural use of nude and buff for things light tights and crayons assumes that brown skin doesn’t exist! And one last one, since I started getting feisty: she explains that the reason cave paints lungs were made like all archaeologists and art historians are in agreement about the motivations of people living 10s of thousands of years before motivations got written down!

My neighbor suggested it last spring and it was well worth the read. A little science, a little history, a little art, a little story-telling, it was easy to read, never too heavy, just the right amount of time spent on a topic; informative and interesting. Even the set up of the book is nice: sections divided into the color they are discussing and about an inch along the edge of each page printed the color being discussed. I realize these are probably close approximations as there is so often discrepancies in printed color. I have never considered the fact that, with the old masters, we are ""seeing [the painting] in lighting conditions entirely different from the ones it was created in."" Think that doesn't matter? Have you ever painted a room and wondered why it looked so different from morning to night? And many of the colors used then were not as stable as colors now, so many have deteriorated.

As such, there is no plot, no storyline, or whatever. I still give the book 5 stars because it was an absolutely delightful read. The introductory part was extremely useful in understanding what colours are - are they added or substracted? (Read the book if you don't know what that means. :)) The main part of the book is a walk-through of the story and history of many, many colours. The layout of the book is an utter delight. Kudos to James Edgar, the designer of the book! This is another example of a book borrowed from a library to ""check it out"" and then purchased because I want it on my shelf. I think a designer should have this on their shelf, but I need it for the nerd factor. The stories and anecdotes about the colours here are fascinating and a bit scary at times. It's amazing at how many dangers colours have presented to people (and plants and animals) over the ages. I recently saw a beautifully curated exhibit of Van Gogh at the Danish museum, Arken. This book is the perfect follow-up to that exhibit in the stories about the expense of colours, the impermanence of some colours, and the elusiveness of some colours. It all adds to the depth of the artist whom you get to know during the exhibit."

She has made a chromatic inventory of human skin tones The boys’ outlook [on life] is so much rosier than the girls’, that it is enough to make a baby girl blue to think of living a woman’s life in the world. (And that is why girls were dressed in blue and boys in pink). Pink was for boys because it was a bold color, since red was a man’s color and pink was only a faded red. Blue was more demure and was associated with the Virgin Mary‘s clothes or cloak. In Fragonard’s painting in Fragonard‘s painting the women are in full pink and fully in control of their sexuality, since pink was for strong women. Shocking pink is the color of choice for some 20th century women who wanted to be both seen and heard. Pink’s latest disfavor probably came from the feminist movement backlash against old-fashioned sexualism Baker-Miller pink Pepto-Bismol pink on the walls of jail cells actually does calm violent inmates. Puce is the color of fleas. The color of Marie Antoinette‘s dresses. [I’ve never liked Dusty Rose, and now I know why—it’s the color of fleas]. Buff is from the word buffalo— Buttery yellow leather. Edward Burnes-Jones didn’t connect the idea that his tube of mummy colored paint was actually ground up mummy, until a friend mentioned it.

These aren't the colours of scientists, however, they're the colours of artists and emperors: isabelline, gamboge, fuchsia, cochineal, dragon's blood, Tyrian purple, heliotrope, indigo, kelly green, khaki, kohl, jet, etc. Each chapter is a short essay on a particular shade that draws from multiple sources: art history, the age of discovery, organic chemistry, or contemporary design.

Read as ebook (which I’m sure was not ideal for design purposes). St Clair wrote a column about the history and social context of colors — this book comes from the column. And you can feel that. I loved everything I learned, from the sumptuary laws governing what colors different social classes were allowed to wear in Victorian England to some of the now-weird processes used to synthesize pigments (lots of urine). But each column is very short, and many end with a pithy magazine style ending that is reasonable for a column but sort of abrupt in book form and left me wanting a Mary Roach-style deeper dive in many cases. But overall: we really don’t appreciate how good we have it with being able to easily buy bright colors, wear whatever we want, and mindlessly choose from a million affordable paint hues whenever we want."

Escher is probably one of my favorite modern artists. This book is a collection of his graphic work, focusing mainly on tessellations, but also on things like impossible objects, metamorphoses, distortion, and reflection. He's most famous for the Escherian stairs, and also the hands drawing each other into infinity. Escher's work is the kind of art you can just stare at for long periods of time, marveling at the beauty and complexity put into such simple, understated forms. I really love him. Some of the themes in his art are objects transforming and warping. Checkerboards turning into splotches turning into birds; birds becoming fish; abstract or symbolic becoming realistic; the distorted reflections in glass spheres; physically impossible three dimensional constructs; tessellations where objects alternate and repeat within a pattern; and chiaroscuro. There's a lot of , as well. The more you stare at his work, the greater the depth. I'm not sure what else to say about this book except that I really, really enjoyed it. I've only taken a few classes on art-- drawing of and the history of-- but I like it a lot. I'm not very good at drawing or painting but I admire the people who can. I wish the United States was more appreciative of the arts, as I think it adds a new and valuable perspective on life and the world we live in. Just look at Escher with his beautiful renderings of the tenets of physics and geometry. 5 stars"

Each picture's description includes the title, type of work, date, measurements, and a comment of some length. Most of the pictures are black and white, some have color. They are in 10 groupings, full of rhythm and repetition; some feel better than others, but tastes vary. The earliest is from 1922; most of the pictures are from 1940s and 1950s; the newest one finished in 1968. There are buildings, landscapes, flora & fauna, people and different shapes. Some pictures are easy to understand with just a glance, some take a longer (enjoyable) time. This is a brief read, but the pictures are all great. Some I have come across elsewhere, but many I had not seen before. The type of repetition-work here was much fun to look at, some even for a longish while.

If you'd like to know more about the person behind the artist, this is not the right book for you. The few pages of text only highlight the selected artworks and the patterns in them. But if you want to have a concise overview of the main themes in Escher's work followed by 76 beautiful page-filling pictures, then you might consider to add this little jewel to your bookshelf. Although the book isn't A4-sized, the pictures really come into their own as they're always depicted alone on a page.

That one might be more 'complete', but as most of the pages show multiple works at the same time, few of them draw the attention in the same way as they do in this (in comparison) smaller book.

I enjoyed the fact that all the images were grouped into categories, which made everything way easier to understand the concepts and the philosophie behind them.

I always wonder what it would be like to see the images of artists like Escher and Haeckel in their own time, long before television and with photography still in its infancy. This was the period of transition, when images still had a sacred quality to them, bringing to life beings and ideas. They carried both the tradition of centuries and the contradiction of being harbingers of modernity. This period is probably more interesting than the decades after of complete deconstruction. Looking at this art, when a full life would be filled with as much images as we now see in a week is hard for me to imagine. What would it be like?"

The book explores the work of Kurt Gödel, M. C. Escher, and Johann Sebastian Bach and how they relate to each other, especially regarding the fundamentals of mathematics. While a very heavy book that overwhelming for me at times, it nevertheless fascinated me. And given that Escher was the one I was familiar with the least, I figured I'd get a book about his work. It starts with an introduction by the author himself, which I wasn't expecting and it was certainly a positive. However, that introduction is disappointingly short and information-wise, there is little is in the book. It has a section with a caption for each image, also written by Escher, but the descriptions are very straightforward. As if the image was being described to someone who couldn't see it in technical terms, feeling very soulless. The fact all the captions were together, and I had to constantly go back and forth for each painting, was very unpractical. That aside, Escher's art can be mesmerizing. I felt that almost all his paintings fall into two major themes. The first is simpler geometric shapes transforming into complex objects, often with a linear increase in complexity, and with different areas of the painting morphing into different objects. This also included the use of negatives, where the empty space surrounding one object made another object. The second is different perspectives integrated together, making optimal illusions. The most classical one is the impossible staircase. While the previous theme is fun to look at and has a psychedelic feeling to it, this one is particularly engaging because it forces your brain to pick a certain framing and assumption of what the frame of reference is. You can feel your brain switching whenever a certain perspective shifts into a primary one. Because the perspective is mostly unconscious, it's not always obvious, and there were times when the pictures were deceptively simple and it took me a while to understand their complexity. The problem with Escher, at least within the work presented in this book, which I'm not entirely sure how representative it is of his overall work, is that it gets repetitive. The more paintings you see of the themes mentioned above, the less exciting they are. At least if you're reading the book in one go as I did, perhaps that wasn't the best way to go about it. While I enjoyed the book and the art, I felt cheated that so little information was presented. I was expecting a lot more information on Echer and each individual painting. Not a technical level describing what perspective a wall is taking, but rather on more philosophical grounds of what makes such type of art appealing to Escher and what he is trying to communicate. If you just want to enjoy Escher's paintings, this is a good book. Particularly because the print quality is fairly high and the book's price is accessible. However, if you were looking to probe into Escher's genius in any explicit sense, then this book isn't helpful."

Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Here we see an artist drawing upon science to frame his underlying thoughts which belie the subtlety of light and dark matter, light and shadow, obscurity and the overt and always between the blurry lines of pseudo reality. All this in a time when these concepts, however apparent they are in the first half of the twenty-first century, were deemed mere fiction. Indeed Escher ushers the onlooker, as an observer and not a rubber necker, yet still the observation makes the viewer the surveyor of a trainwreck, from the neo Victorian era into the post modern; art which uses function and integers rather than symmetry and beauty as his under-sketch. STOP...Escher time!"

Escher introducing and describing his own work is a real treat. Not all visual artists will do this, and not all who do will be given (and/or interested in) the printed distribution of their words. His introduction is peppered with inspiration and wonderment for process and being. To me, it seems the body of work was an adventure and a dedication that became an inner world seeking expression. There are 76 print reproductions in the book, the majority of which are arranged in a way to communicate a specific line of thought that Escher had decided upon. My favourites were: Magic mirror, Belvedere, Swans, Horsemen, Reptiles, Moebius band II, Flat worms and Another world II."

The images and drawings by Escher are truly amazing. MC Escher was a gifted artist with a vivid imagination, creating drawings and images that seem to defy the rules of the real world. The detail in the images and the beautiful geometric patterns, such as flying birds gently turning into fish, or his self portrait in the reflection of a glass sphere held in his hand. Fascinating."

M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},I read this book when I was in art college at a time when highly detailed work was of great interest to me. Now I have a wider appreciation of art and its many visions and imagination. Escher was a true master of perspective and the printing press. One on his own in the mastery of precision. His illusions catch the imagination of everyone.
M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Love me some Escher, but I don't feel like this was the most optimal cross-section of his oeuvre - focusing too much on his mosaics and not enough on his most famous (and most intriguing) later works. I've approached this from the perspective of an art consumer and not as a design student and that probably was my ultimate mistake. This period surely has its many fans as well, but you should be aware which side of Escher you're primarily getting here above anything else."

M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"No one depicts the impossible, improbable, and infinitesimal the way M.C. Escher does. He is work is essential to explore our minds and the universe. It is rare to find an artist try to capture the essence of philosophical, scientific, and fantastical thoughts in every piece. Each line, each element, each color, has a purpose to the whole. His works blows my mind no matter how many times I spend staring at them; superbly the most brilliant artists. Definitely start off with this book, whether you have little knowledge or a lot.

M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It's hard to talk about Escher's work intelligently because it has so thoroughly entered modern culture, without succumbing to the occasionally offensive repurposing of the works of Warhol, Kahlo, etc. It quite wonderfully fits into the 'What is there to be said that hasn't already' category. I got this after seeing an Escher retrospective at the Portland Art Museum, and this is a solid volume that is a great introduction to his work. It wonderfully captures Escher's mix of the artistic and the mechanical, but does lose some of the majesty in the shrinking down of the works. Particularly in 'Metamorphose' which in it's full size is truly extraordinary."
M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Reading Escher's commentary on his own work is enlightening and entertaining. His dry wit is a delight. Not a delight is the lack of initiative on the part of any publisher since the original 1967 printing (looking at you, Taschen and B&N) to move his comments to the same pages as the works instead of keeping them in a section at the front for the reader to flip back to from the plates at the end. It's also somewhat on the shorter side, so I'd recommend any Escher fan to read it as a supplement to a larger collection of his work, rather than as a single look at the artist."
M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"These are no ordinary paintings by an ordinary artist. They bend the rules or reality, and you have to regard them as puzzles to be solved. Twist your mind around them to see what they are and how they do it for full effect. There are several different types, combinations of abstract mathematical, mosaic patterns and pure fantasy, all united by the dreamy unreal logic. A real joy to the open mind."
M.C. Escher: The Graphic Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/276287.M_C_Escher/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I loved this book. Art in general doesn't really interest me unless it is obvious. I can appreciate a beautifully painted picture of a meadow, but I don't get abstract or art like that.

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I never thought much about Patti Smith. The images I saw of her never attracted me, and what I knew of her Rimbaud fixation turned me off. I always had a problem with the Beat and Punk appropriation of Rimbaud as more a figure of rebellion than a sophisticated poet. For me poetry is a phenomenon of the page, not an outfit you wear down the street. I also never got into Punk Rock. Going to college in the fall of 1983 I had probably only heard of The Sex Pistols, though I had never listened to them. Then when I got to college I was immersed in it, without my choosing to be. I loved some of it but just never pursued it as an interest or as a lifestyle, it was just the soundtrack to my experiences. At the time I was more into focused listening of Prince (and King Crimson and The Talking Heads) than Black Flag and The Dead Kennedys. And somehow, even during college, I managed to never listen to ... until a couple years ago. But what a great album! and I would say about it what I would say about other Punk I've gotten into since - such as Television and The Minutemen - that it is nothing other than simply great Rock & Roll. So I grew curious about Patti Smith and then this book came out and I snatched it up. It's a sweet and gritty account of her growing into maturity and how it coincided with her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There's a wise naturalness in how she grew into the woman we now know. There was ambition, but only on her own terms, and there was no striving to be part of a scene outside of herself (& Robert), though she ended up in one fascinating scene after another as the grimy and vibrant New York art/bohemian landscape tumultuously morphed into the previously unknown seemingly by the hour in the late 1960's and early 1970's. She portrays these scenes as the outsider she always felt she was, yet they're portrayed head-on, not through a scrim of self-consciousness or psychic distance: she was in the thick of it, even acting as a nurturing figure to many, yet she was also strangely apart from it. Throughout there's a focus on her intimate relationships and how their effects radiated out into the situations she was involved in, which gives the feeling of a real regardless of how crazy things were. But whoever she was with - Jim Carroll, Sam Shepard, a guy from Blue Oyster Cult - Mapplethorpe sill permeated her consciousness. In many ways they were alike, but in even more important ways they were very different, and part of the fascination of this book is pondering the duality they set up - Robert alienated from his family and erasing his past to find the future while Patti was always firmly bedded in her past and in her family, Robert's wild drug use and Patti's basically straight life, Patti's Victorian sloppiness and Robert's decadent minimalism, and of course the sexual complications. This book is not only entertaining but lovely and wise too."

If only I had been able to show up at the Chelsea in the early 1970s. I coulda been a contender, I could have lived for art. Oh yes, I would have been very naïve just like Patti had been at first. I totally get that. I don’t think I could have been as brave tho'. Art is a harsh mistress. What I loved about this memoir is how it communicates (in a rough, rambley sort of way) what it was like to be there. In that milieu. It almost seems irrelevant that they all became famous."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Hi Ho, the artistic life. I had very divergent feelings about Just Kids, Patti Smith's National-Book-Award-winning memoir about her friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There were times that I felt moved by the beauty of her writing, and others in which I found her to be nothing more than another spoiled, entitled kid who got where she got to, talented or not, because of connections. It is not that Smith arrived in NYC with a list of names and numbers. But she did have the good fortune to encounter a knight in shining armor who had a prodigious artistic drive and the good looks to attract a series of male gateways to the New York arts scene. - image from El Pais - photo credit - Cordon Press There is no doubt about the deep connection Smith formed with Robert Mapplethorpe, famed photographer to-be. They were not only lovers, but bffs. And that continued long after they stopped sharing a bed. Smith takes us on a journey through the gritty and some not-so-gritty portions of the New York arts scene, offering glimpses of the many, many people she and Mapplethorpe met. It is a veritable who's who, including bits and pieces on Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sam Shepherd, Andy Warhol, William Burroughs, and a cast of hundreds. I never got the impression that Smith was name-dropping. She was as amazed as any aspiring artist might be at finding herself among so many notables. One downside to this is that so many shining lights speed by like houses at night as seen from a train. I would have liked it had she gone into a little (or a lot) more detail on more of these luminaries. She certainly does reinforce the image of the Chelsea Hotel as a cauldron of creativity in its day. The story of her arrival in New York, meeting Mapplethorpe and struggling to get by is worth the price of admission, a real look at what it means to be a starving artist. And that is not just a glib turn-of-phrase, as Patti, at times, made use of the five-finger discount in order to eat. It is also fun to read about how she and Robert trolled discount stores for materials they would use to make jewelry or incorporate into other artistic projects. – image from Vanity Fair Despite the minimal physical mileage traversed here, is a bit of a road story. Instead of crossing continents, she and Mapplethorpe cross from obscurity to fame, from outsiders to insiders, from fellow travelers (in a very non-political sense) to lovers to soulmates I was surprised at a few things. Ok, look at almost any photo of Patti Smith and tell me with a straight face that she doesn't make you think of the Calvin Klein ideal of physical appearance. Yet, when she appeared in a play as a person with drug issues she was completely uncomfortable pretending to shoot up. Even her director was shocked at her lack of hard drug experience. A little weed here and there does not give one that lovely look. A diet sprinkled with stolen food contributed for sure, but nature sculpted that body, not dark substances. I was also surprised--having come to the book with no familiarity with Smith beyond her recording of “Because the Night”--about the diversity of her artistry, running from drawing to poetry, to playwrighting, to acting, and so on. I have read better memoirs, and I do not think this should have won the National Book Award. But there is no missing the real feeling she communicates, the love she and Mapplethorpe had for each other. Her writing is good, sometimes better than good, and you will not be disappointed. But for many, the lifestyles presented here might be discomfiting, the willingness to engage in hustling, thievery, and very open relationships make the artistic world Smith and Mapplethorpe inhabited a decidedly acquired taste.

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"There are some moments of real poignancy here and some very deft turns of phrase, but I was also just bored stiff for most of it. Clearly Smith has led a really interesting life, but she's just not a great writer. The great bulk of the book was a long series of ""Then this happened. Then that happened. Then Robert did this. Then I did that."" And while there is a lot of reflection about art, there is very little on the subject of her relationship with Mapplethorpe, supposedly the purpose of writing the book. How and why did she stick with him -- as a lover -- through his gay hustling? What did she feel about this? She is by turns squeamish about his homosexuality and also fully accepting of everything he does. There's nothing inherently wrong with either reaction but I'd like to hear a little more about them. Bottom line: had this not been Patti Smith writing about Robert Mapplethorpe, and had I not been in a book group where we were discussing the book, I wouldn't have kept reading past the 50th page."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I found this book to be quite boring, unfortunately, especially given the fact that Smith is arguably an artistic genius. It started off strong, but after a bit the writing style began to wear on my nerves (examples: using the word ""for"" instead of ""because,"" as in ""I went to the diner, for I was hungry"" and ""I hadn't any money"" instead of ""I didn't have any money"" and ""I lay upon the mattress"" instead of the simpler ""I lay on,"" which all felt somewhat pretentious). Then she goes on and on (and on) about Rimbaud. So much Rimbaud. And Baudelaire. So. Much. Baudelaire. Her sentences were also quite choppy and repetitive—I could essentially sum it up as: ""I met a boy named Robert. We loved each other. We hadn't any money. One day I bought a raincoat from a thrift store. I went to France and visited Rimbaud's grave and wore my raincoat for it was raining. Robert was a genius and we lay upon a mattress. One time I met Jimi Hendrix. Then he died. Then I wore my raincoat out in New York and I bumped into Ginsberg. He bought me a sandwich for I was hungry and hadn't any money. The end."""
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm not sure how to do this book proper justice in a review. Just Kids is a book that enthralled me, surprised me, and ultimately, a book that I have fallen in love with. Not only is it one of the best books I've read this year, it is one of the best books I have ever read. Knowing very little about Patti Smith or Robert Mapplethorpe going into reading this, I figured I would enjoy it but not quite appreciate it as much as someone who is a big fan of either. And while that might be true, I still came out of this book with the utmost appreciation for both and for those people living, breathing, and being artists today. Because, this book is about art. It's about art that you love so much that you make sacrifices like sleeping on doorsteps or eating anchovy sandwiches. It's about art that consumes you, that frustrates you, that makes you feel alive. Patti Smith is an artist through and through. And I am completely inspired by her story and her companionship with Robert. Hearing about their lives in 1960's and 70's New York City was incredible, meeting the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, William Burroughs, and incredibly talented artists, poets, musicians, writers, etc. For a short time I was transported into the mind of an artist, into the time of her creative birth, and came out of it with an experience that I won't soon forget. I am sure that I will read this book again in the future and each time take away something more."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is remarkably easy to parody. Here, I'll try: ""I was crossing Tompkins Square Park when I ran into a young man wearing a gabardine vest. He smiled at me and called me ""Sister."" It was a young George Carlin. Robert hated him because he frequently had flakes of rye bread in his beard, but I loved how he could make me laugh with his impressions of Mick Jagger. On this morning, though, we wept together at the news that Paul McCartney would have to sell his house in Cannes. It was a sort of paradise for us, even though we'd never been. George gave me a feather to put in my hair, and I took it home and pressed it between two pieces of crepe de chine, where it left a ghostly impression. Robert insisted on using it in a construction, and finally I relented, though I knew I'd never get it back. It was a sacrifice to art, the sort of thing Rimbaud would've done."" I think this parodic potential arises from the book's total and complete lack of irony. This is the most earnest, sincere book I've read in a long time, and that's what makes it so heartbreaking. Smith begins the book with an abundance of naivete, and in many ways, she never loses the idealism with which she begins her career. Written in a lyrical, elegiac tone, this is, at its heart, a book about the bond two artists develop. There's a remarkable amount of honest in the pages, and Smith's and Mapplethorpe's friendship is unique. They were lovers, collaborators, confidants, rivals...Their lives were the stuff of legend, and this book is a valiant effort to put that legend on the page. If you've ever held the romantic ""starving artist"" cliche in esteem, this is the book for you. Smith spends paragraphs talking about how hungry she was when she first moved to New York, and she isn't using the word as a euphemism for ambition -- she really needed to eat. Upon her return from a season in Paris, Mapplethorpe greets her in a feverish state, suffering from abscessed wisdom teeth and gonorrhea. And yet! They lived the lives of artists, staying up into the wee hours creating, writing, singing. They knew everyone. Harry Smith, Allen Ginsburg, Sam Shepard, Jim Carroll, Todd Rundgren, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin -- they all passed through Smith's life, and they all make memorable appearances in the book. It's a name-dropper's paradise, and yet, I didn't come away from the book feeling as though Smith was boasting or exaggerating her own life. I'm sure she's omitted some unfortunate moments on her rise to the top, but she seems honest about her own shortcomings (She freely admits that she acted like a jerk after her first big poetry reading, for instance). I knew nothing of Robert Mapplethorpe beyond his work and the controversy it had caused in the late 80s (I was too young to understand much of what he was trying to say, though I could understand the controversy just fine). The portrait Smith paints of Mapplethorpe is one of a passionate, wildly creative artist, and also of a man driven by his ambition to become famous. Her friendship with him was clearly the defining moment of her life, and reading about it was a pleasure. I often felt lost in this book, and I suspect that that's the only way to read it -- to just plow through it. I don't think I share all of Smith's ideas about art, but I respect her passion and her talent as a writer. Her prose is clear and direct and eminently readable. And maybe best of all, wherever I took this book, people would comment on it. ""I just finished it. It's heartbreaking."" Or ""I wish I had her passion."" I love when I read a book that inspires that kind of connection between people. It makes me feel, even if only for a moment, that I live in the kind of world that Patti Smith lives in."

Flower children raised their empty arms and China exploded the H-bomb. Jimi Hendrix set his guitar in flames in Monterey. AM radio played 'Ode to Billie Joe.' There were riots in Newark, Milwaukee, and Detroit. It was the summer of Elvira Madigan, the summer of love. And in this shifting, inhospitable atmosphere, a chance encounter changed the course of my life. It was the summer I met Robert Mapplethorpe.” *Warning: Slightly gooey, syrupy review ahead. Written on the eve of my daughter’s seventeenth birthday, with all the standard warm and fuzzy feelings you might expect and loathe.* This beautiful, magical memoir is an ode to art, to music, to writing, to New York City, to life, to love, but most of all to enduring friendship. True friendship that lifts the other up, affirming one’s worth and sustaining the soul. While this is Patti Smith’s memoir, I had the feeling throughout that it was really a tribute to Robert Mapplethorpe and his art. As it turns out, Patti made a promise to Robert that she would one day write their story. What a story this is! I knew little about Patti, other than a couple of her songs, before reading this. I knew almost nothing about Robert. To think that I could have missed out on such an inspirational life adventure! This is a quintessential tale of struggling artists, living in New York City, trying to make their big break. Smith’s writing is poetic, conversational, and candid. She talks about her romantic relationships with Robert and later with other men, as well as Robert’s relationships with his other lovers, including his most lasting with his patron and lifelong friend, Sam Wagstaff. She never apologizes or shows regret for any of their choices. Life was what it was, bringing the good with the bad. They lived the lives they chose, and there is nothing to be sorry for in doing just that. It makes one feel wholly nostalgic for a different sort of past. Naturally, in a book like this, one is likely to stumble upon some name-dropping. It didn’t bother me one bit. When an artist is making his or her way in the world, there are going to be others that come into their orbit and influence their lives. It seems to me that it would be impossible to write a story of one’s life without mentioning those persons that played a large part. Living for a time in the iconic Chelsea Hotel, Patti and Robert ran into a number of other musicians, artists, and writers. I’m not going to mention names here, but these were sometimes funny little stories, often involving misunderstandings. Many of these went on to become household names, while others never made it to the big leagues. Patti seemed very humble about all of it. There’s no affected swagger to her eventual fame. I don’t read a lot of memoirs, but I’m going to have to say this has got to rank up there with the best of them. I love to read about the creative process, what gives one the urge to share something sacred, something that reveals the stuff of one’s self. What does it take to succeed? Everyone has dreams, but only a select few actually realize them. I spent some time this past weekend listening to Patti Smith on Spotify and searching for Robert Mapplethorpe’s photography on the internet. I’m smitten by the two of them now, and I’m not ashamed to say I couldn’t close without grabbing a tissue. A genuine celebration of art and life!"
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I closed Patti Smith's book; my heart squeezed with emotion. The fusional meeting of two beings who recognize themselves at first glance is shared by a single ambition to devote their lives to art. This drive takes us to the heart of creation in the sixties and seventies in New York, with the periods of lean cows, the belly screaming famine, odd jobs, shoddy plans, and shabby piles to land but far from discouraged the total osmosis between Robert Mapplethorpe and the native of New Jersey, convinced of their talent. Patti Smith recounts this period with a tremendous narrative sense, with random encounters and an incredible cast: Janis Joplin, Andy Warhol, Allan Ginsberg, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Sam Shepard, and Bob Dylan. His loving poetry, Rimbaud, an unlikely pilgrimage to Charleville, recklessness of an era that many will pay with their lives in the eighties and the arrival of AIDS. A testimony to keep a promise made to his artistic double. Sincere, overwhelming, and full of modesty, the hope is held and in what way. Thanks, Patti, if I can."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Looking For You (I Was) I can see why some reviews detect white-washing or sugar-coating in ""Just Kids"", but I wanted desperately to believe the story Patti Smith was telling about her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. Patti admits to her naivete, but I don't think she was trying to hide stuff from her kids or anything. Nor do I think she closed off her emotions about her past. Ultimately, the book is a love story, only the love extended over a long period, and sometimes it was requited, sometimes not. Lots of things got in the way, sexuality for starters, drugs for main course, other partners for dessert. But the book is about a love that they shared, and a youth that they both retained the whole of their lives, no matter what happened on the inside or the outside and no matter how poor or successful they were. The name of the book asserts her belief that all that time they really were ""just kids"", those two kids that the tourists photographed soon after they first met. Although Patti reveals a lot about Robert, I think ultimately the book is her final expression of love for him. I think it's important that she express her sugary side anyway, rather than ""hide your love away"". The book might be relatively sugar-coated for our image of Patti Smith, but her sugar isn't as sickly sweet as most sleb love stories. One of the reasons I empathise with this book so much is my passion for Robert Mapplethorpe's photography (not to mention Patti's music, lyrics and poetry). In March - April, 1986, I was on the Board of the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane, at the time we helped to bring an exhibition of Robert's photos to Australia. It was a time of great political and moral conservatism in Queensland. The Board included artists and academics who feared the loss of their jobs, if they were involved in the exhibition of photography that might later be found to be obscene under our criminal laws. Many Board Meetings in the lead up to the exhibition debated whether we should not proceed with the exhibition or remove particular images (including ""Man in Polyester Suit""). I made some tentative preparations to deal with a potential criminal action against the Board Members, including getting expert evidence on Robert's artistic status. In the end, we decided to proceed with the exhibition in an uncensored form. All images were displayed in the form submitted by the artist and the curator. The exhibition was highly popular and no complaints were made to the Police. No criminal prosecution occurred. The important lesson is that we could have self-censored and lost our own freedom. Instead, we asserted and preserved our freedom in the face of fear. For me, Robert and Patti represent, not just the existence of freedom in the abstract, but the assertion of freedom in reality. They more than earned the right to their love."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I admire this woman. She writes a deft, deeply felt prose. She has a peerless memory. She remembers gestures, apparel worn thirty years ago, favorite objects, facial expressions, stretches of dialog. She can reanimate for us moments of deep emotional complexity. This was clearly a labor of love. The character study of Robert Mapplethorpe is disturbing, shattering. We watch Smith living with him as a veil is lifted from her awareness, as her empathy broadens and she carries the reader along with her. This is memoir as maelstrom, cataclysmic in its effect. There's more than sufficient foreshadowing. We know that Robert will die. Yet one still finds oneself grabbing futilely for the gunwales, whirling ever faster, ever downward and inward. The book reminds me of Jean Stein and George Plimpton's in it's New York setting. But Stein and Plimpton's book consists of transcripts of recorded conversations worked up into semi-confessional monologues. It's compelling, but it doesn't touch the nimble pairing of image and incident we find in , nor does it have the latter's exquisite verbal compression. Like , this book details an era of New York's art and cultural scene, but with a vividness I've never come across before. This intensity radiates from The Hotel Chelsea where Mapplethorpe and Smith occupied a room. The middle third of the book gets a little lost in name dropping. I suppose that's inevitable. There's less insight into Mapplethorpe, whom the author is growing away from. The sixties greats parade by: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, et al. Then the artists and then the poets and so on. The narrative dissipates under this welter of names. Smith dates poet and rocker, Jim Carroll (""People Who Died""). She dates playwright Sam Shepherd (, etc.) One begins to lose track. Who's Matthew with the 45s again? We watch Smith's astonishing evolution from visual artist to poet to rock and roller. If someone were to write this story as fiction, it would probably be criticized as unrealistic. The theme, one of them, is the artist being true to his or herself and doing the work. Fascinating is the level at which which both Mapplethorpe and Smith learn their art. They are huge talents but they have entered a talented artistic circle that beggars description. When Shepherd has to leave Smith to return to his wife, they pen a valedictory play which is later staged at the American Place Theater in midtown. Mapplethorpe falls in love with photography when curator John McKendry brings him into the Met vaults and shows him rarely exhibited works by Stieglitz, Strand and Eakins. Until then he was hesitant to do his own photography, though Smith had repeatedly encouraged him to; he worked in photo collages with images from male magazines. Smith in her turn is cajoled into poetry by Gregory Corso and into song writing by Bobby Neuwirth. Who can claim such mentors and so many of them? Most artists' develop in far less encouraging settings. Smith and Mapplethorpe have been incredibly blessed. Toward the end the author reaches for a kind of ecstatic prose flight that seldom works. Fortunately the attempts at woolgathering are few. We are soon returned to earth by way of Mapplethorpe's suffering. I was especially pleased to learn that in his last 15 years or so, he had found a partner, Sam Wagstaff, who supported him in all he did. Wagstaff was both patron and lover, and rich as Croesus. Mapplethorpe no longer had to hustle sex on 42nd Street to make the rent. Wagstaff bought him a studio on Bond Street, walking distance from his own flat. Smith herself no longer needed to work at Scribners bookstore either. She recorded which made her an international star. So when the end comes at least it is unmarked by the poverty and obscurity of Smith and Mapplethorpe's earlier years. Smith, living in Detroit by then with her husband, Fred Sonic Smith, drives to New York to see both men—Sam is sick, too—during their final illnesses.

To be honest, I did not know much about Patti Smith other than her music. When the book initially came out, I heard so many wonderful things about it. I thought I should give it a shot. But frankly, I was a bit tired of the 'musician' bio books as some were just so dreadful. I was so wrong to think that and hold off on this book. I decided to go with the audio. I was immediately enthralled with it. The audio is narrated by Smith and she does an incredible job. Who else to 'read' the story of her life other than the one wrote it and lived it. Just Kids tells the story of Patti growing up and following her desires to go to NYC and grow and become an artist. She tells of the wonderful life-long friendship that she had with the photographer, Robert Mapplethorpe. I had no idea how talented Patti Smith is - she's a poet, artist, writer, musician, singer, actress. She has been in photos, acted in plays, wrote lots of songs, wrote books on poetry and non-fiction. She came into contact with so many different types of artists that helped her grow - various notable musicians, poets, artists. There were a lot of famous people mentioned but these are the people that were in NYC during this time when it was on the cusp of art and artists coming alive. She talks of her time spent in the Chelsea Hotel in NYC which, at the time, was a haven for artistic folks. But out of all those mentioned, it was Mapplethorpe who pushed her and helped her find her artistic abilities and find out who she was/is. It's amazing that these two found one another and pushed each other. It's a beautiful story. I saw Patti Smith speak recently and she said that Mapplethorpe, before he died, asked her to tell their story. Just Kids is that story and a story that took her 20 years to write. I know why this book won the National Book Award and why it's #4 on the 100 best music books of all time. It reads like poetry. Link to this list of 100 best music books: I'm so glad I read this. A true highlight for me, my favorite of 2016, and one I plan to read again."

Just Kids should've been a perfect match and yet somehow I could never completely connect with the world and the lives of the people it chronicles. Don't get me wrong, Smith's wordsmith is gorgeous and she is a wonderful storyteller. Her account of how she and her lover/collaborator/friend Robert Mapplethorpe, met and ended up right at the center of New York's influential art and music scene during the 60's and 70's is nothing short of remarkable. reads like an emotional elegy to Robert Mapplethorpe and a love letter to both him and the city of New York, which was at the time the indisputable mecca of the rock and punk movements. Smith is sort of an oral curator as she recounts numerous encounters with an impressive group of artists, the city's rich cultural legacy and how she and Mapplethorpe became deeply ingrained in it. But throughout most of the narrative I had the sense that Smith seems to define herself and her claim to fame, in direct proportion to her proximity to other well-known artists. She and Mapplethorpe are never more than two or three degrees separated from the likes of Hendrix, Joplin, Warhol or Dylan. And she makes sure to remind us, over and over again. Her relationship with Mapplethorpe was complex and, at least from the outside, difficult to characterize. But it's obvious that in spite of his sexuality and his very conflicted attitude about it, they seemed to have found in each other a true soul mate. The final chapters, in which she describes Mapplethorpe's last months before dying of complications from HIV/AIDS, are very moving and felt to me like the most authentic part of their story. Maybe this memoir would've had a bigger impact on me had this been the musical soundtrack of my youth. My impression is that I lack both the cultural context and perhaps the creative sensibility to fully appreciate the contributions made by these artists. Nevertheless, this was an interesting read as I learned quite a lot about a fascinating and influential artistic period. Finally, I suspect that it'd be difficult to replicate the cultural and social atmosphere that allowed Smith and Mapplethorpe to blossom as such iconic figures. It's hard to imagine today's most prominent artists casually rubbing elbows like they did at the Chelsea Hotel back then. I think that's mostly a reflection of a more idealistic and innocent time in America. I read and simultaneously listened to the audio book, which I have to say is beautifully narrated by the author."

The summer of “Crystal Ship.” Flower children raised their empty arms and China exploded the H-bomb. Jimi Hendrix set his guitar in flames in Monterey. AM radio played “Ode to Billie Joe.” There were riots in Newark, Milwaukee, and Detroit. It was the summer of Elvira Madigan, the summer of love. And in this shifting, inhospitable atmosphere, a chance encounter change the course of my life.” It was that summer when Patti Smith met Robert Mapplethorpe. is a love story of these two young people who, against all odds, meet, fall in love, and cling to that love long after they’ve chosen other partners, other ways of life, and love. It’s a love story of the city where they fell in love, and perhaps even a bit of a love story to the art and poetry and music that was created in the course of their love story. They combined their meager possessions, but money was problematic, they barely made enough money for food – and frequently went without. Extras were out of reach. Books they had already owned were their prized possessions, as was their music limited to those albums they’d brought into this relationship. And still, they were able to enjoy some concerts just by virtue of being in the right place at the right time, or knowing the right person. There are a very few years that they were not in touch, Smith’s focused on her music career, her marriage to Fred “Sonic” Smith, and Mapplethorpe focused on his art, his partner. Time passes, children come along, and when Smith is expecting a second child, they re-establish communication. I knew very little about Patti Smith, I knew who she was, is, and that I’ve heard some of her songs, knew she was a musician… beyond that, nothing. So, when this book first came out, and my brother sent me a signed copy of this, along with a few other books, and I vaguely recall seeing it and wondering why he sent it to me. And then, years later, also sent me a signed copy of M Train. I was beginning to feel a little guilty. I loved this. There’s a bit of that raw energy and the grittiness of living in their early days together, the descriptions of the city, especially at night. The Romeo and Julietness of it all. Beautiful prose. Their story reminded me of one of my favourite poems, Edna St. Vincent Millay’s"

There's an oddly innocent tone to this all--for instance, the sexual relationship between the two of them is never really discussed, only accepted--when Patti gets the clap, we understand it's from him, but this is not a kiss and tell memoir. It's an opportunity to walk a mile in Patti Smith's head, in a less coded and more factual way than in her music or poetry, but no less poetic for having been a lived life. Patti Smith has always been my idea of an artist--that an artist is different from an intellectual. The artist's way of being in the world is not about mincing and dicing experience, but about allowing oneself to resonate with events, to be played by the texture of life, and seeing what one is naturally drawn to, and how that stimulates an artistic reaction. Her way and his way. I like the unselfconsciousness of this writing--in an odd way, unself-examining, a paradox in a memoir. I have read the Patricia Morrisroe bio of Mapplethorpe--admittedly for the Patti Smith/Mapplethorpe material--and it's a revelation to read Patti's take on that time versus the reportage of people who had known them at the time. I love the layering of experience that way, as anyone who's read my work will know--the difference between the lived life and the way it looks from the outside. If it were someone else, I would even question the simplicity of the tale-tellling, the innocence portrayed, say, if it were Dylan or other more manipulative figures--but having listened to Patti Smith for 25 years, I believe this awkward innocent visionary quality. This is what we need, what I need, in our pathetic, overfacebooked, overstudied 2010s. More living, more art, more innocence, more faith, more poetry, more friendship, more acceptance. ***********************************"
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"its dark no im wrong its dawn i have my shades on —‘Sleepless 66’ Patti Smith writes to us out of the great and endless narcotic American night in a language inherited from the Beats and refined across a lifetime of lines scribbled on journals and diner napkins and hotel matchbooks, carving out her version of the truth. Despite all her awed talk of Mallarmé and Baudelaire, she is much more in sync with her compatriots like Paul Bowles and Hunter S. Thompson, and when she walks through a New York crowd she sees, like Pynchon or a grungy Walt Whitman, ‘Boys on shore leave, prostitutes, runaways, abused tourists, and assorted victims of alien abduction’. Her writing is deadpan and matter-of-fact; reading this book is like talking to some hoarse, hungover stranger in the kitchen after an all-weekend party, someone in an oversized T-shirt chain-drinking coffees, exhausted but full of mysteries to relate. She never overdoes it, but the easy colloquiality of her tone disguises a faultless understanding of where the focus of her memoir should lie – when to skip through several years within a paragraph, and when to lavish pages on a single mesmeric afternoon. The time and place she is dealing with have passed into legend, and fortunately she is not averse to the pleasures of namedropping: Just another day at the Chelsea Hotel, circa 1969…. It must be tempting to overplay your involvement in things if you were around then, but Smith is all cool circumspection; ‘I was there for these moments,’ she allows, ‘but so young and preoccupied with my own thoughts that I hardly recognized them as moments.’ Instead, all her attention was given over to the one man who seemed to have dominated her emotional life and her artistic development, Robert Mapplethorpe. I didn't know Mapplethorpe's work very well, associating him mainly with the all the controversial 1980s black nudes, and it was strange encountering him through Patti Smith – he seems so unlike his image that for a while I was convinced I'd confused the name with someone else. Her descriptions of their often-grim early days together are among her most evocative passages, and show off her direct sense of atmosphere to good effect. I have to admit, I felt a little churlish about her obsession with him at the beginning of the book, having chiefly wanted a memoir of Patti Smith and not of Robert Mapplethorpe. But that feels very ungracious as the book goes on and she convinces you of his importance to her. What exactly drew them to each other is never made completely clear; a mixture of desire and support and artistic inspiration, but one that caused them both a lot of pain as Mapplethorpe started to explore his interest in men and in New York's S&M scene. Smith describes the two of them, in one of her many astute references to French literature, as being ‘irrevocably entwined, like Paul and Elisabeth, the sister and brother in Cocteau's ’. I was charmed by the sartorial nature of Smith's memory. Almost every scene is introduced by way of a run-down of what she was wearing at the time, and the details of her outfit are often much more vivid than any of the conversations; this is not reeled off in a label-conscious fashionista way, it's just clearly the way she sees the world. ‘I don't remember what I read,’ she says of one of the early poetry readings that would lead to her rock career, ‘but I remember what Robert wore….’ Sometimes whole anecdotes are built on this clothing recall: when at a party the designer Fernando Sánchez questions her choice of white sneakers with black jacket, black tie, black silk shirt, and ‘heavily pegged black satin pants’, she tells him she's in costume as a tennis player in mourning. And when she auditions guitarist Tom Verlaine, she almost treats it more as a test of wardrobe than of musical compatibility: Oh for a photograph. Patti Smith is – there's no getting away from the word – incredibly cool. While at the Chelsea Hotel, she talks about her fascination with all the legendary former guests, and writes about scurrying from floor to floor, ‘longing for discourse with a gone procession of smoking caterpillars’. It's hard to imagine that kids won't be longing for the same thing with her years after she's gone, and this raw and touching memoir of late-60s, early-70s New York is, if nothing else, a beautiful gift to them."

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Patti Smith's Just Kids is a rare little gem of perpetual bliss. This differs from other memoirs I have read, and it left me with deep feeling of simply being happy to exist in this world. Smith writes about her time living in New York with Robert Mapplethorpe while they were both shaking off the dull scraps of adolescence and trying to break out as artists. Strewn throughout the book are pictures of them as very young excitable artists-in-training. I rarely have come across two people in book that felt very much joined at the hip. Smith's prose reads like a soft-focus fairy tale. The sections set in the Chelsea Hotel, especially, have an almost Dickensian quality to them; they read as a quaint story full of larger-than-life characters, most of whom have hearts firmly of gold. Reconciling this wistful retelling of her youth with the persona I associate with her was intriguing to say the least. And obviously I am not the only one who found the disconnect between Patti Smith's presence and her internal life jarring - there are places in the text where she discusses how those around her took her for a lesbian and even a junkie. Her prose is wispy, light and airy, and her memories are wholesome, despite the fact that anyone who knows the history of that scene knows just how much death and self-immolation is happening just off screen. Patti Smith herself seems to have waltzed through it to my astonishment seemingly unscathed, and her writing dances along the edges of the darkness that her scene held. The book is structured superbly well, it opens with the moment Smith hears of Mapplethorpe's death, then jumps back in time before they have met. Smith discusses her teenage pregnancy and the process of giving her child up for adoption, her failure at teacher's school, and her time on a New Jersey assembly line in a brisk and somewhat sanitized fashion; again, there seems to be in her writing a distaste for discussions of the negative, of the hard and bleak moments of her life. From there, the book jumps forward to her first meeting with Mapplethorpe, their sweet and heartfelt romance which warms the heart so much, the little poverty-stricken life they build together, and how hard they worked to evolve their relationship with each other when their life trajectories began to diverge. There is a poignant nostalgia throughout, and she comes across as a wholly likeable person, regardless of whether you like her music. A most poetic of memoirs. The only thing that kept me from scoring a five, is that she sometimes distracts from things, and I also would have liked to have seen a greater description of the physical aspect of New York, which must have been one hell of place to be caught up in at the time."

Luxuriated in it. Drank deeply of my hatred. I didn't just find the writing clunky, I found it odd, troubled by an overfamiliar relationship with the passive voice (lots of things ""could be seen""), verbs (no one ever god damn says anything; they discourse, spiel, spin, regale, blah blah blah), and prepositions (why say ""on"" when you can add a syllable to get ""upon""? why use the mundane ""because"" when you can replace it with ""for"" and sound like a Victorian lady novelist?). You know in the beginning of the movie ""Labyrinth,"" when Jennifer Connelly is reading out loud from that book about the Goblin King? It sounds like that. I didn't just find Patti Smith kind of strange and off-putting in the way she explains that other people who were not as cool as she may have. I found her (or her portrayal of herself, which is not the same thing) actively frustrating. I'm not sure if she intended, as a writer, for her and Mapplethorpe's pursuit of fame to sound so damn groupie-ish. Lots of tracking down someone who is famous and following him around."

I didn't know much about Steinem, but her book made me see her in a whole new light -- not an icon, but a lovely dedicated generous person. I had a similar experience listening to the audio of Patti Smith's Just Kids. I didn't know much about her, but certainly wasn't expecting to be so charmed by her. The memoir focuses on her early adult years. She moved to New York, developed a complicated relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe and tried to figure out her place in the world. Rather than making herself sound heroic or tragic or dishing out tawdry gossip, she talks with great openness and generosity about her life, her family and her friends. Much of what she describes is mundane, but she recounts it with so much appreciation for small moments in her life that it's hard not to fall in step with her lovely sensibility. In many ways, I didn't find it easy to connect with the way she lived -- pretty gritty at times -- or her relationship with Mapplethorpe -- but I loved seeing it all though Smith's eyes. It helps that Smith writes really well -- occasionally veering into prose closer to poetry -- stark, simple and expressive. It all made me feel like slowing down -- appreciating what's there -- my family, friends and surroundings. A note on the audio: Smith narrates her own story. She has a slow droning voice. It really grew on me. You're going to love it or hate it. I gather the physical book has many photos."

Through the years these roles would reverse, then reverse again, until we came to accept our dual natures.” In this book Patti Smith tells the story of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. What starts off as a love story, shifts and revolves into a deep connection of friendship and understanding and that of maker and muse. Patti Smith has some of the most beautiful and lyrical prose I have read. She details her time in New York and the encounters that led her to Robert Mapplethorpe, their struggles as starting artists, lovers, friendship as well as shifting self-identities and questioning self-belonging. It was amazing to read their struggles together, their love for one another, exploring sexuality, exploring their art, and how each influenced the others art. Patti details all of the artists that she met along the way to her artistry and how these meetings influenced her as a person and her art. I knew of Patti Smith as the music artist but hadn’t known that she was a budding poet with a keen interest in writing her own poetry and displaying her own art. It details her life as trying to be a poet and to get recognised, the introduction of her poetry with music, and the eventual transition into lyrics and music with a band. This was an amazing biography dedicated to her time with Robert Mapplethorpe, a friend and previous lover who had such an influence on her life and vice versa. It was amazing to see their growth with each other and remaining by each other’s sides- even when they were far distances apart- how they each thought of the other despite time and distance. This was an intriguing and fantastic biography and I loved reading about this relationship. I had consistent songs of Patti’s playing through my consciousness while I read this book and loved reading through some of her poetry included at the back."

This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the 'creative temperament'--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."" This is exactly what is being expressed here on every single page: a heightened sensitivity to the promise of life. A romantic readiness such as we rarely get to experience today. A quintessential American love story."

Robert enjoyed being noticed, and he affectionately squeezed my hand. ‘Oh, take their picture,’ said the woman to her bemused husband, ‘I think they're artists.’ ‘Oh, go on,’ he shrugged. ‘They're just kids.’”—Patti Smith I was a little skeptical about reading this National Book Award-winning memoir of Patti Smith’s relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. I have “punk laureate” Smith’s collection of poetry, Seventh Heaven, I knew her Horses, and defended and appreciated Robert Mapplethorpe’s “obscene’ photography, and knew they were a special couple. I knew they were capital-A artists of the sixties and she still is going strong now. But they were not my people, exactly. Theirs was the NYC scene of the sixties, Warhol, Burroughs, Dylan, Corso, a kind of transition from folk to punk. Smith was an artist, a poet, and musician; Mapplethorpe an artist, photographer. The story she tells of those days is familiar to this 64-year-old self who lived in conservative Grand Rapids, Michigan in the sixties and pored over Rolling Stone and the Village Voice, wanting to be there. But I was a folkie, without the dark edge of this couple. Maybe I was skeptical about it being so highly awarded as some of you—not me—were skeptical of Dylan’s Nobel Prize for Literature. “Where does it all lead? What will become of us? These were our young questions, and young answers were revealed. It leads to each other. We become ourselves.” –Patti Smith I was shocked to learn how conventional much of their upbringing and even art world lives really were, in some ways. They were—especially when together; Mapplethorpe had a much darker side when he was not with her—irrepressibly positive spirits, living for their art and each other. I fell in love over the course of this book with Smith’s sweet and joyful attitude toward almost everything in that period, even as her friends die, Jimmy, Janis, Warhol, and even her Robert. Hers is not a tell-all expose of the time, but a loving elegy to a time of great spirit and imagination, and a testimony, a love letter, to a great relationship: “I imagined myself as Frida to Diego, both muse and maker. I dreamed of meeting an artist to love and support and work with side by side.” “What will happen to us?"" I asked. ""There will always be us,"" he answered.” “We used to laugh at our small selves, saying that I was a bad girl trying to be good and that he was a good boy trying to be bad. Through the years these roles would reverse, then reverse again, until we came to accept our dual natures. We contained opposing principles, light and dark.” And they saw themselves not as mirroring their time, as artists, but forging a new vision: “We feared that the music which had given us sustenance was in danger of spiritual starvation. We feared it losing its sense of purpose, we feared it falling into fattened hands, we feared it floundering in a mire of spectacle, finance, and vapid technical complexity. We would call forth in our minds the image of Paul Revere, riding through the American night, petitioning the people to wake up, to take up arms. We too would take up arms, the arms of our generation, the electric guitar and the microphone.” I loved the portrait of the Chelsea Hotel she paints, and indeed all of the bombed out places she and Robert lived in and nearly starved in: “The Chelsea was like a doll’s house in the Twilight Zone, with a hundred rooms, each a small universe.” This is a pretty conventional memoir/biography, told chronologically, pretty straight-forwardly, but it gains steam and power and pathos as we get to the inevitable end. The last hour had me in tears every five minutes or so. Listen to this book! Patti is speaking to you! “We promised that we'd never leave one another again, until we both knew we were ready to stand on our own. And this vow, through everything we were yet to go through, we kept.” “There were days, rainy gray days, when the streets of Brooklyn were worthy of a photograph, every window the lens of a Leica, the view grainy and immobile. We gathered our colored pencils and sheets of paper and drew like wild, feral children into the night, until, exhausted, we fell into bed. We lay in each other's arms, still awkward but happy, exchanging breathless kisses into sleep.” “We were as Hansel and Gretel and we ventured out into the black forest of the world.” “Patti, did art get us?' I looked away, not really wanting to think about it. 'I don't know, Robert. I don't know.' Perhaps it did, but no one could regret that. Only a fool would regret being had by art; or a saint.” I wept at the very end of this audiobook reading by Smith, recalling as one does at funerals all of the loves and losses and deaths of one’s life. But I also wept at the beauty of her simple and direct and clear writing, an expression of love for a loving creative time in our history and a loving relationship.

Before Robert Mapplethorpe died, Patti Smith promised him that she would one day write the story of their years in New York City. Now, twenty years after his death, she has made good on that promise. This is the story of a beautiful, complex, demanding and ever-evolving friendship between two young, hopeful, actively unconventional creatives. They alternated in the role of muse to each other as they felt their way through the New York City art/poetry/theater/music scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were struggling to find their special niches and become accepted as artists. In this process they were often also struggling for simple survival. They frequently went hungry and had no place to sleep, all the while bolstering each other's resolve and refusing to give up their dreams. I never really knew anything about Robert Mapplethorpe aside from a big flap in the 80s about how his work was offensive. Smith writes about him with such tenderness and honesty that I couldn't help weeping when she described his death as a result of AIDS. We should all be so lucky as to have a friend like Patti Smith---a friend who could remember for us our youthful, most hopeful, most vulnerable selves and memorialize us so genuinely."

I was in NYC for several weeks in the summer of 1966. (""Hot town. Summer in the city. Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty."" This song was released while I was there, and I thought ""Yeah man!"") Saw Dave Van Ronk perform at a coffee house with about a dozen other people. He was way cooler in person than his character was in the movie. But I wasn't hip enough back then to appreciate just how very cool he was. (If I could time travel I'd go back to that concert and give Van Ronk a standing ovation.) The section of Just Kids about The Village at that time was spot on. Back then I was just a kid too.

And in that folds of faded violet tissue a necklace, two violet plaques etched in Arabic, strung with black and silver threads, given to me by the boy who loved Michelangelo."" ( this and then read) Reading this was an interesting experience for me. Lately I've had a weird but insatiable urge to read memoirs by 1970's musicians. Why? Not really sure - maybe I just need to re-watch . But for whatever reason, I had a particular literary itch to scratch, and only Patti Smith's memoir would do. I had heard before reading this book, and I knew that Patti Smith was a musician. I had never heard of her lifetime friend and partner Robert Mapplethorpe, and most of the artists who get name-dropped in this book flew right over my head. For this reason, this memoir might as well have been pure fiction to me, since I had almost no frame of reference for anyone except the biggest names. But I think that, ultimately, this worked in my favor: instead of spending every other page thinking, ""oh my god, she totally knew [famous person] before they were famous!"" I was just focusing on the story. And it's quite a story. People who go into this book expecting to learn about Smtih's songwriting/performance career will be disappointed; her retelling of how she became a famous musician is basically ""someone suggested that I try putting my poems to music and people seemed to really like it, so that's cool I guess."" There's not much about her actual writing process, even. She talks a lot about Rimbaud, and tries very hard to write like him. Occasionally you find yourself rolling your eyes at her prose, but for the most part, her writing is quite lovely. This is, first and last, the story of a lifelong friendship. This is the story of people who sacrificed everything - home, family, comfort, security - in order to become artists. What makes it lovely is that you get the sense that becoming famous - at least, famous in the sense that most people would recognize - never even crossed Smith's mind. She wanted, purely and simply, to devote her life to art. She was poor and homeless and miserable, but she was happy. A true starving-artist story, occasionally overwrought, but always compelling. Patti Smith is cooler than everyone you will ever meet."

I remember being in bed and waking up, for example, to the sound of Guns and Roses’ November Rain, Don Henley’s The Boys of Summer or Patti Smith’s Because the Night. I liked but absolutely fell in love with and and (tried to) sing them all the time; while I was just playing around, did my homework or was waiting to fall asleep at night. I was eight or nine years old and fell in love with music. At the time I was already completely in love with books and became what my friends and school colleagues thought to be a very weird (and boring, aha!) companion. What I loved (love) the most about songs was the magical combination of words (poems/stories) with music itself; all blended together to create a work of art. I didn’t know it at the time but I was soon to be completely obsessed about lyrics and in my teenage years I’d read them whilst listening to a song until I got to know them by heart. This obsession was probably contagious because soon my brother was afflicted by the same “disease”. As the years have gone by, my brother drifted away from books and lyrics and became one of those casual listeners, just listening to music while driving to and from work. Even my neighbour, who will never know the part he played in my life, stopped listening to very loud music and became an alcoholic instead. But time had exactly the opposite effect on me and the older I got and the more I read and “analysed” song lyrics (and books) the more I felt myself falling into this spiral of words, sounds, imagery and feelings. By my early twenties I knew nothing would ever matter more to me than seeing and trying to turn my life (and everything in it) into a work of art. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that I’ve succeeded and became an artist in the clear sense of the word because (unfortunately) I don’t believe I did. All I’m saying is that I didn’t and don’t want to live my life away from art, and if I can’t create a work of art myself I’m at least planning on surrounding myself by the work of others till the day I die. The world and the life emanating from the pages of are the one’s I believe in and have been yearning for all my life. So, yes, I do believe ."

""longing. that desire. that tapeworm.a word I hadn't learned"".... (Seventh Heaven- ""Longing"") I really longed to LOVE ""Just Kids"", to go the whole hog with 5 stars. I had waited long enough to get hold of a copy & eventually when my library got it in some jerk kept it overdue 3 whole months and I was checking with them every 2nd day like a teenager. ""Is it back yet"". I wore out my welcome buying up discarded books and lurking near the door hoping to nab the overdue offender in their tracks. LOL. Now I'm confused, discombobulated..who is Patti Smith..where is the Patti Smith I thought I knew.. I've ended up only just liking it with 3 stars & my heart has sunk. Another idol demasked or re-masked again. It makes me feel little mean hearted since Patti was my adolescent heroine. Although truth be told on reflection I didn't know zip about her private past, only shadowy images of her with Robert Mapplethorpe. Mainly I knew her voice and her records, those I played over and over. Her poems in my original 1972 copy of ""Seventh Heaven"" was something sacred to me, some holy grail of truth if I could only decode the essence of, I could be like she, or something...such is the stuff of puberty or perhaps I had blinkers on then most likely. Maybe I have a wrong take on this but I feel she's sugar coated her early life with Mapplethorpe. I can't believe she was so naive. In the thick of all the action in NY, at Max's & the Warhol crew. Friends all around doing drugs and she being 23-4 didn't know anything about drugs. Oh come on. At that time I was 14-15 and knew more about the street than she purports to have known. My upbringing not that different or richer or poorer than hers. But she bangs on about how poor her and Robert were in the 70's in the book and I can't really come to grips with her take on things. She's all the ""SERIOUS ARTIST"" and in the world but not of it.?? WTF. Totally dispels any illusions she was all ""sex drugs and rock and roll"". I feel like she's writing this view of herself...""the goody two shoes naff poet"", for some other person.....her family or children perhaps. Maybe..... The early chapters alternate between her childhood and Roberts. The mid-secton is where I have trouble(as described above). She goes into fairly explicit details about Roberts homosexual adventures and loves, his art/porn and creativity issues and final relationship and death from AIDS. She talks about her trip to Paris and Baudrillard's grave, and she was distanced like I've never felt her distanced in her music or poems. Is that Baudrillard's Simulacra? Something's slightly skewed here because I just didn't feel her passion in ""Just Kids"" - EXCEPT when she was talking about Mapplethorpe's art and death - I didn't get a sense of connection when she talked about her marriage either, it's censored and distanced also.. I think in truth it's not about her it's about Robert. The book is littered with wonderful images of Robert and of her (taken by him). It's more his obituary. It's sad. Sadder than I can say."

At the start of this memoir Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe met three times by chance, once in Brooklyn and then twice in NYC when they were both young and literally starving artists. After the third meeting they never parted and were together for years, despite both of them having other love relationships, helping each other with money, food, housing, and supporting each other in their work. . The story shows the fascinating development of both of them as artists. They were so poor that they used found objects or very inexpensive things to make their art. Sometimes they would have to make a decision between eating and buying something they wanted for their work. What is so interesting in watching their evolution as artists is that neither of them became the type of artist which they initially set out to be. They eventually live in The Chelsea Hotel. It was fun to get an inside look at this famous hotel and the various artists either living there or visiting. Smith describes their lives there and the people they met, some who would become famous artists of one kind or another and others who would not. I loved the camaraderie of the people living there, helping and supporting each other in many ways. When Patti and Robert had to move out of the hotel because of his need for more space it was this camaraderie and the general atmosphere of this artist-occupied hotel that Patti knew she would miss the most. Patti writes this memoir with sincerity and earnestness. From the start, she believed that she and Robert would both make it as artists and, as we know, they did. This memoir is a fascinating look at the development of 2 artists and their evolving friendship and work over 20 year plus years."

I was embarrassed to admit that I really did not know who Patti Smith was. Curious me, did a google search and read a little bit about her book, Just Kids, and had to admit that I was interested enough to listen to the audiobook. After all, I had grown up during those wild and turbulent decades of the 60’s and 70’s. It turned out that I realized that I knew her song “Because the Night” after all. Robert Mapplethorpe, on the other hand, was a complete mystery to me. I had never heard of him and I was not aware of his photography work. I was so glad, though, that Elyse brought Just Kids to my attention. I listened to the audiobook that was read by Patti Smith herself. Her narration was perfect. I felt like I was in a trance as I listened to her soothing voice tell her and Robert’s story. Patti was a singer, song writer, poet, artist, performer, friend to many, lover to a few, wife and mother. Just Kids was Patti’s and Robert’s story. It was funny, sad, tender at times, intimate, riveting, and encompassing. It vividly portrayed the New York scene during the 1960’s and 1970’s. Patti Smith shared how a chance encounter changed and reshaped the rest of her life. That chance encounter was the day she met Robert. He came into her life at just the right time. Patti found herself without a place to live, she had little or no money and she was almost starving. That day in Brooklyn was the start of Patti’s and Robert’s journey that was surrounded by their love, devotion, art, poverty, friendship, sadness, happiness and pivotal challenges over many years. Patti and Robert were about to discover a mutual trust in each other, a beautiful and honest friendship, a love affair that lingered, strengthened and evolved over the years and a mutual respect for each other’s artistry. Both Patti and Robert were influenced by the artistic successes and friendships with artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Andy Warhol. The Chelsea Hotel was the backdrop for a good portion of their lives. They both eventually gained fame through their individual artistic talents. It was a long and hard road though. They struggled a lot until their talents were recognized. Throughout all their ups and downs their love and devotion for each other remained a constant. Robert later discovered his true sexual preferences. He was homosexual and ended up living with a devoted partner. Patti remained supportive of Robert as their love took on a more platonic relationship. Years later, Robert contracted AIDS and was dying. Patti was now a wife and mother. Despite their separate lives, Patti found a way to be by his side while Robert was close to death. Their love story was beautiful and sad and captivated my heart and emotions. I was so glad that Elyse recommended Just Kids to me. Thank you Elyse. What an incredible and beautiful book! It was so well written and I learned so much about Patti Smith and Robert Maplethorpe. Just Kids was the winner of the NationalBook Award in 2010. I highly recommend this book."

If I had any doubts that art is 99.9% about networking and nepotism, this book put those to rest. It weirds me out how Smith describes everyone as ""Occupation FirstName LastName."" Like, ""The painter Joan Smith"" or whatever. I feel like I'm supposed to know who everyone is, but many of them are random coworkers who never re-appear and seem tangential. Despite this, I'm finding it an easy, enjoyable read. Certainly a fascinating era, although I will admit to being baffled by the National Book Award banner on the cover. This somewhat blandly written telling of someone else's story is a National Book Award winner!? ""We had donuts. Then I worried I was a failure. And then Robert did a lot of socializing and got in with rich powerful people."" The era is interesting, but I don't think the book really is."

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book had a massive impact on me, so thanks to Steven for recommending it! I didn't know very much about Patti Smith, probably a bit more about Robert Mapplethorpe, but I certainly know a lot more now, and what I've learnt has re-shaped my understanding of success and fame. The book shatters a lot of myths in that regard. Famous artists or rock 'n' roll heroes/heroines are sometimes thought to have something (or to have something when they started out), perhaps a kind of aura or personal destiny, that sets them apart from the rest. Well, Patti Smith did not have anything that the girl next door couldn't have. She came from a relatively poor family who loved her and supported her (and above all, did not interfere with her life choices), but who could not give her an enviable education or connections. She was neither particularly beautiful, nor fabulously talented, nor even very very lucky. What she did have was enormous determination, a dedication to her art, and to a way of life that meant she had to sleep rough and eat whatever she could get her hands on, at least in the early stages. She took all this, and more, into her stride. She also had a loving attitude to the world, and related to people and to life genuinely, not like some others who are really wedded to an image of themselves. I loved Patti Smith after this book. I also loved Mapplethorpe, but could not relate to him in the same way, perhaps because religious imagery, esp. symbols of good and evil (Madonnas vs. Satans, for example) do not do anything for me. I can understand the originality of his photographs, but his images remain for me a more cerebral affair. It's different with Patti Smith; her personality speaks to my whole self. What she's given to the world is not a body of work separate from who she is but her own self, and I admire her for that. What Patti Smith was able to do, everyone can do, provided they put their heart and soul in it!"
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"oh go on, they're just kids I'm still trying to collect my thoughts about this book. I know it made me feel something, I know I have every intention of re-reading it, and I know many anecdotes from it will come up in casual conversation with my friends when I try to convince them to read it. Still, I am not sure what the emotions are I feel when I think about it. There's obviously a feeling of loss and grief; not just for Robert Mapplethorpe and Sam Wagstaff, but also for all the other artists, players, hustlers, and socialites in their circle who had tragic ends. They were all walking the same cusp, brushing shoulders with some of the most influential musicians and artists of the sixties and seventies. So many people in this circle must've thought they were on their way to achieving their creative dreams, only to be mentioned later on in the novel to have taken their own life, died of an accidental overdose, or other unfortunate circumstances. There was also hope, and optimism, and a feeling that anything is possible. There was certainly some magic, both light and dark, that people flirted with, and in some cases became lost. Personally, I felt the magic was strongest at the Chelsea hotel. There was humor, like Patti's first interaction with Allen Ginsberg, when he mistook her for a very pretty boy. And there were plenty of respects paid to the generations of the artists who laid the foundation for the next breakthrough. One thought that kept coming back to me throughout this whole memoir, were just how much the times had changed. She spoke of living in NYC as an artist selling books and scraping by. She spoke of how far fifty cents could get her and even at her worst she and Robert knew they would find a way. It's sort of crazy to think that if she and Mapplethorpe were born today, or were in their twenties today, they could not have taken that journey to NYC (or it would've been more complicated). It almost felt like the spirits of the city back then were encouraging them to succeed and based on my very limited knowledge of NYC I don't know how well this journey could be replicated today. I loved this book, and I look forward to further digesting it in the coming days."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I really wanted to love this book because memoirs is a genre that really appeals to me. I don't read enough memoirs because the good ones are hard to find, so when I heard about this one I was very excited. I think the hype may have ruined this book for me. I loved the beginning and I could feel the magic of Patti's poetic language and her vivid descriptions of her life in the 1960s. But gradually, during the book, I started losing this magic and I felt no connection with the book, the descriptions or Patti & Robert. I read because it was entertaining, but I wasn't as deeply impressed as I hoped I would be. I partly blame that for the fact that I thought I knew who Patti Smith was when I started reading. For some reason, I thought she was Lily Tomlin whom I really admire and would like to learn more about. But I quickly realised that I was mistaken and that I actually knew nothing of the woman I was about to read about. I recognized her name, but a quick search on the internet made me realize that I knew absolutely nothing about her. I think that kind of decreased the reading experience for me because I started out disappointed. I think that if I'd known who Patti Smith was, this book would've been so much better and more interesting in my eyes, despite the very beautiful language and magical transportation to another world."

Reading the story of Zelda Fitzgerald by Nancy Milford, I identified with her mutinous spirit. I remember passing shop windows with my mother and asking why people didn't just kick them in. She explained that there were unspoken rules of social behavior, and that's the way we coexist as people. I felt instantly confined by the notion that we are born into a world where everything was mapped put by those before us. I struggled to suppress destructive impulses and worked instead on creative ones. Still, the small rule-hating self within me did not die."" (PAGE 174) I don't know who the hell Patti Smith and what songs she even did. I know nothing of rock and roll or its start in the New York scene. I did not Google or YouTube her yet but I was drawn to this book by a fantastic review by Candi. I am loving this genre at the moment and decided this was worth taking a look at. This was written so good and was so interesting and engaging, to say the least. This is about Patti's life as a poet and the start of her evolving into a performer with Robert Mapplethorpe in the 60's and finalizing into the late 80's. Robert saved her from a bad date and after that they never lost sight of one another. Their young, very poor, love penetrated through the pages. The pacts they made always take care of each other was felt. But as we all know young love can trick us. Robert was a confused artist trying to imitate his art into an Andy Warhol style that took its own turns and twists. Robert was determined to make art his way. During this time he started questioning his sexuality and slowly their friendship, while still strong, was confusing for a young and naive Patti. She thought she wasn't woman enough to save him but she lets him be himself. This was their relationship in a nutshell. So much love, a bit of confusion and hurt feelings, but always letting the other person be true to themselves. I liked learning about Hotel Chelsea and the scene at the time. She talks about meeting Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and many others in the poetry underworld. She meets famous people that succumbed to vices and now have nothing and ended up forgotten and dead. One of her stories really made me feel sad. She was in a scummy drug infested hotel. A balding skinny graceful man sees she doesn't belong there and tells her his story. He was a famous ballet dancer that succumbed to meth and heroin; then told her about the Chelsea hotel. It was so sad the people she encountered during that period in her life. Her main goal was poetry but with that came song lyrics. She got lucky meeting people that helped her along the way. She talks about this luck many times throughout the book. She always had her family, which were super supportive and kind and gave her financial help, discretely. Robert had it differently. He couldn't accept the word homosexual for himself as his parents were ultra conservative Catholics and he was terrified of his father. This book was raw and gritty and honest. I will recommend it even if you are not into rock and roll music. It fascinated me through and through. I would not have read it nor picked it up if I had not seen such a great review by a great reviewer (Candi). Side Note: If you Google Robert Mapplethorpe you will either be fascinated by the work he was trying to convey or be repulsed. While Patti does a great job of explaining the why's and how's of his work I don't find it fascinating, in fact I am revolted he tried to do certain works. But I know art is for arts sake. What can inspire me to feel won't create that feeling in another person."

Whenever he said things like that, for a magical space of time, it was as if we were the only two people in the world. Right before his death due to AIDS in 1989, Patti Smith promised Robert Mapplethorpe to one day put their story into writing. is the fruit of that promise, a memoir chronicling their journey together as lovers and later as friends and collaborators, and importantly, as artists, from the time they first met in 1967. It is well known that the two served as creative catalysts for each other and that their unique emotional connection shaped their personal and artistic development in unshakeable ways; is an incredibly heartfelt and beautiful recounting of how they lived, loved, and matured into the mediums that they finally became known for: photography and music. In this memoir, Smith draws a brilliant portrait of Mapplethorpe as a boy and a true artist, down to the most attentive details of what he wore, said, and what excited or upset him. The writing makes the connection between the two almost palpable, full of adoration and support even as the latter struggled to stoically come to terms with his own sexuality as well as the sexual potency of his art. I couldn't help but admire Smith's lucidity and her honestly in talking about their problems and struggles together, but also the intensity with which she maps their individual trajectories while maintaining and eulogising their bond as birds of a feather: from being Monday's children and the battles that drew them to making artists of themselves — him, acid; her, giving birth at 19 — to the various friendships and loves built around their own blue star. is also a valuable memento of the artistic spirit of New York City in the 60s and the 70s, before gentrification and the glamourisation of artistic hunger were to take over. Smith's eloquent prose takes us through an almost mythical, larger-than-life moment in the history of art in America, where the likes from William Borroughs and Allen Ginsberg to Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin keep going in and out the doors nonchalantly, supportive and humble whether struggling or successful. Be it living at the Chelsea Hotel or socialising at El Quixote and Max's Kansas City or performing at CBGBs, Smith's memoir encapsulates some of the most memorable visions from a city as a confluence of influences — of art born from the rubbing together of great minds — and a vibrant artistic culture at the cusp of giving in to the wealth/fame oriented notions of stardom we know today. Lovingly structured and intimately written, this book allows the reader a rare glance into the sacred space that is the mind of an artist — throughout this book I felt incredibly close to everything happening in it, and once I started reading I could not stop. is a love letter to art, to love, to struggle, passion and reinvention, to New York City, and not in the least to Robert Mapplethorpe, whose eyes it seeks to make us meet. Incredibly touching and truly, truly brilliant."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It is difficult for me to think of an artist who illuminates pure positive affect in the way that Patti Smith does. For someone who always had a special place in his heart for Patti's ""Horses"" record, I can safely say there are moments where her music and her words have taken my mind and my heart to places I would have never imagined. For me, the record has a similar effect to Allen Ginsberg's, ""Howl,"" and Walt Whitman's, ""Song of Myself."" The passion, the energy, the blood-racing anticipation between her vocal crescendos... It is absolutely on fire. However, I have found that ""Horses"" is a rather polarizing record. People who are into rock and roll either like it or hate it. I love it. My brain chemistry gets perfectly locked into Patti's grooves, and I'm happy to know that I can revisit this amazing album throughout my life anytime I feel the need. When ""Just Kids"" came out, I realized that it had been quite some time since I had last thought of Patti Smith. My reading habits have changed a lot throughout the years, and I'm generally not a fan of biographies. However, I knew I would enjoy this one. I was simply waiting for the right time to read it. One of the many things that fascinates me about Patti Smith is that she was simply a naive and innocent child full of so much wonderful curiosity, a perpetual outsider who had no misgivings over the fact that life would be an uphill battle. Unlike many artists whose early lives were subject to torment and desperation, Patti came from a humble and loving home. Patti was not abused by her family, (she actually spoke very tenderly of her parents and siblings), nor did she express any excessive disdain towards those she encountered during her early struggles, (not even towards her factory coworkers who dehumanized her; thus providing the impetus for her song, ""Piss Factory,"" nor the prying and judgmental eyes during her teenage pregnancy.) And even though she arrived in New York homeless and hungry and would generally fare no better until the latter end of the '70s, Patti's enthusiasm and diligence completely outshined her hardships. Patti was in love with life. She was intoxicated with the freedom that came with being a young artist in a city of the world; finding inspiration and friendship during the unlikeliest moments, and holding onto these moments until they became the core of her being. One of the things I adore most about Patti Smith is her ability to live simultaneously inside her own head, completely losing herself within a sanctimonious inner world of books, dead poets, and philosophers, while also living very much in the moment. All of her encounters with '60s rockers like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Grace Slick, along with her introductions to future celebrity artists, like Jim Carroll, Sam Shepard, and Tom Verlaine among many others, excited her, energized her, and gave her a great sense of fortune. She never took any of these encounters for granted and she continues to keep these people close to her heart to this day. Patti also never denied nor shied away from the influence of those who came before her, (particularly Jim Morrison and Arthur Rimbaud). I particularly enjoyed the passage in the book where she visited both of these young men's graves in Paris. The only thing I haven't mentioned yet is Patti's friendship to Robert Mapplethorpe. What a sweet, sweet thing. Their bond was beyond friendship, beyond physical love. These two were soulmates in the classic sense. Robert and Patti completed one another, challenged one another, and guided one another throughout every course in their lives. Even her descriptions of their simplest outings and everyday musings came across as life-changing journeys. She pulls this off without being overly dramatic or grandiose because the love these two had for one another was complete, endless, and beautiful, and it was perfectly captured in this book. I was a little surprised that Patti didn't delve more into the lives of her bandmates, her children, or her husband, the late, great Fred ""Sonic"" Smith. But then again, as she firmly stated, this was she and Robert's story, and she promised him that one day she would write it and share it with the world. That's precisely what she has done, and I'm very thankful for her doing so. This book was a glorious experience for me."

I keep second guessing myself, because by all rights I should've enjoyed it. Though I'm not a fan of the 2007 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, I am a music fan, and a fan of many of the musicians who've proudly listed her as one of their biggest influences. I also (back in the days of my living near MOCA, LACMA and the Getty Museums in Los Angeles) consider(ed) myself an art asthete (and if I still lived there, would almost certainly have checked out Ms. Smith's friend, partner and collaborator Robert Mapplethorpe's monster 2016 retrospective of his photography), but this book (while movingly capturing Ms. Smith's grief following Mapplethorpe's death in 1989 at the height of the AIDS epidemic) didn't quite do it for me. The one thing I think she did do well was capture the ""Starving Artist"" scene in late '60s-early '70s New York City, but the never-ending name dropping and overblown writing (with dozens of non sequitur references to her obvious poet-idols Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire) served as distraction to Ms. Smith's depiction of the oft-stormy relationship between Smith and Mapplethorpe. Just when I was really getting interested (in their stories), she'd wheel out the cavalcade of names that she'd attributed to their success, and I'd be bored insensate. Also, in her descriptions of their ascendancies to fame, I never truly got a feel for they were so successful (other than their association with all the famous people (many of whom I'd never heard of and had to take her words for it as to how influential they were). The few poems of hers that were included here (with the exception of the two in memoriam of Mapplethorpe at the end) simply weren't very good; and the photos sprinkled throughout never really gave me a feel of Mapplethorpe's talent. (Had I not seen a few of his photos in LACMA's permanent collection, I would just have to take her word for it that he had an artistic gift.) But, again, I'm sure it's me: most of my friends loved this memoir. I'm still glad I read it, as I learned a bunch from the NYC art scene, but just wasn't quite what I'd hoped for. I'm not sure her later-released will be either, alas."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"There are a lot of books in this book! The selling point is that it's a a pleasantly gossipy book about the 70s NYC scene. She knows we want to hear about the time she hung out with Hendrix and she'll indulge us. And she's open about how exciting that sort of thing was. But she tones down the fact that she and Mapplethorpe were at the center of their own very exciting circle, eventually - which is good, because she'd sound like an asshole if she didn't tone it down. It's about art, too, And she does talk about art lucidly, which is difficult. Lots of authors suck at talking about visual art or music. I'm thinking of Margaret Atwood's which is a great book but when she describes her paintings I roll my eyes: those sound super wack. Smith seems to really get what Mapplethorpe's up to, and she talks about it in a way that makes me get it too. That's very cool. She doesn't describe her own work nearly as well. I suspect that's modesty. She's willing to acknowledge that she got famous, but she doesn't dwell on it. And it's also this love story, it's about what it's like when you and your partner slowly realize that one of you is gay. She's very kind about it, which makes her sorta draw the veil over parts - I mean, I'm sure there was some drama along the way that she's choosing not to dredge up. But it's still beautiful and insightful. Her relationship with Mapplethorpe seems like it was a special thing, and as a book-long tribute to him - which is the book this is more than anything else - it's very lovely. I'm not a ginormous fan of Smith's music. She can write very good songs ( off her first album Horses is my favorite) and her lyrics are dependably great, but the music itself is very Velvet Underground, by which I mean very ""This isn't a song, it's art!"" and you're like ""...but I songs?"" She's often not crazy accessible. When she does condescend to give you a chorus you're like wtf, this is great, why don't you do this all the time? ""Because "" Well shit. But I'm a big fan of her writing."

Satisfied that this has been made clear to me, I have given the book three stars. Being written by Patti, it tells more of her thoughts than his. By this I am not implying that his views would differ significantly from hers. Their friendship was deep. The whole reads as a eulogy. I believe this book will appeal to those who have themselves memories of the sixties and seventies. It evokes nostalgia. Keep in mind though, it draws —poets, authors, songwriters, musicians and artists. Free love and drugs are part of the scene too. It is not a happy book. I liked learning more about life in the so often spoken of Chelsea Hotel. To those not from this age, names will fly by in a whirl. People are not introduced; it is assumed you know who they all are. The couple’s earliest years together, before either had become acclaimed artists, were for me the more evocative. Mapplethorpe’s demise to AIDS is heart-wrenchingly told. The book recounts her career and their relationship. There is much less about his career. The fact that I don’t have a whole lot to say, says in itself why I cannot give the book more than three stars! Patti reads the audiobook. I find her tone too dreary, level and unmodulated. I cannot say I enjoyed her manner of reading. All I can manage to give the narration is two stars. It’s OK; I easily heard all that she said."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book has remained unread on my shelves at home since it won the National Book Award for non-fiction in 2010. I meant to read it, but when one of my book clubs picked it, I finally had the push I needed. ""In my low periods, I wondered what was the point of creating art. .. I craved honesty, yet found dishonesty in myself."" I knew vaguely of Patti Smith because of her music, and went into this thinking that she would be writing about it. It's in there slightly, but this is really the story of her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which if you believe her narrative, she met on her very first day in New York. Do I sound a bit skeptical? I guess ever since feeling like was a bunch of shenanigans because of too many spectacular events and otherworldly coincidences (and was proven right), I have a healthy dose of the critical eye when it comes to memoirs where the person writing encounters everyone. It's convenient that most of the people she mentions died before this was published. Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, William S. Burroughs, Andy Warhol (okay she admits she knew the people who knew him mostly), etc., etc. So the stories are amazing and strange in the way that all these people are normal humans living at the poverty level within this larger movement. And maybe that is the crux of most major artistic moments in time - right place, right time. And if it's all true (and nobody has ever said it isn't), Patti Smith really hit the jackpot. Much of the happenstance occurs around her, but just as much of it happens her. She seems to fall into art shows and stage productions, even performing music. It's like the people around her are pulling her out because they sense something she doesn't. Or she's being humble. It was hard to tell. Patti writes with great idealism about this time. I'm not sure if she's trying to capture her naivete at the time or if she still lives in that mode, but the beginning and ending of the book, since it starts and ends with Robert's death, gives a rather large punch in the face to the era. AIDS really moved in and destroyed the people who had been creating and interacting so freely in the previous two decades. It was a stark contrast to the open and endless feeling of the time period most of the book focuses on. I enjoyed reading it, even with my spidey sense tingling a little. Getting to know this part of the New York world in the 60s and 70s was very interesting, as I feel like I've read works coming out of it but not much about it itself. But that's the backdrop; is a story of creative soulmates who are sometimes friends, sometimes lovers, but always in each others lives, pushing them to be greater."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I've always been taken by Paris in the 1920s, specifically the nebula of artists and writers brought together by a city that was affordable and spawned many cultural gifts to the world. Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast, for instance, gives us not only unreliable narrator Ernie, but also F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound and James Joyce and Ford Madox Ford and umpteen others. Reading brought that to mind. I was naive at the start, having never known Patti Smith was a singer or artist. I also never knew she was a pair with Robert Mapplethorpe. In any event, what I immediately took to: one, how this is a type of ""Lost Generation"" moved to New York City in the late 60s and early 70s. Though a lot of name-dropping was lost on me, I did recognize many others like Andy Warhol and Sam Shepard and Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and Allen Ginsburg and Jim Morrison. And two, Smith's voice. In no time at all, she had me with her voice. I felt like confidant, friend, sympathizer. All of which amazes me because this book is around 95% narrative, almost no dialogue to be found. How did it work, then? I would say the level of detail. Patti Smith must have taken terrific notes to come up with all of this and carry the reader from start to finish like she did. Soon enough, the reader wishes and some lover were a magical part of NYC in those revolutionary days. As the Lost Generation would have it: ""Hunger is good discipline."" Meaning: In the rearview mirror, all hardship looks Romantic if it comes to a good end. And, for both Mapplethorpe and Smith, it does come to a good end career-wise. Each is catapulted to success by mixing with the right people in the right place at the right time. Place them in Oshkosh and none of this would've happened. As for lives, not such a happy ending for Mapplethorpe. Instead, a rather gruesome one. After putting this down, I picked up my complete collection of Rimbaud and started thumbing through. That's how often the French poet is referenced by Patti. She adores her some Rimbaud, that's for sure, to the point of making a pilgrimage to his French grave after a trip to Algeria, where he also lived, comes off as impractical. The narrative lost a bit of steam and broke up a bit at the end. This may be because Mapplethorpe and Smith went their separate ways and Smith's pledge was to write ""our story,"" per RM's request on his death bed. But, overall, a happy find and an enjoyable read."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I think this book reads beautifully whether your a fan of Patti Smith or not. The beginning of the story I found a slight disconnect of emotion for me as parts that I deemed important are quickly glossed over or skipped quickly, but she can write and I like her style so I don't hold it against her. I admire her stance to stay true to her artistic sensibilities. Her rise from humble beginnings although many times self imposed especially when she first lands in New York for the first time, really without a plan, money or a place to live, she really lived the starving artist at its truest sense. Her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe is the main focus of this book as it's as much about his rise to stardom and notoriety as is her climb to fame. It is a homage to their relationship and unwavering deep love and devotion. A true partnership of support and a true love story of every essence although completely unconventional. Patti shares many of her starstruck moments in and around her stay at the now infamous Chelsea Hotel, with plenty of name dropping along the way. She really climbed her way out of obscurity and poverty and positioned herself around people who were able to take her to the top. She claims it happens mostly incidentally and proclaims she was there more for Robert's sake but I don't buy it, she's savvy and smart and knows what she's doing. She is genuinely talented and the book showcases her many array of talents, her art, poetry, acting, singing and performing. She is incredibly articulate and well read and has a lyrical tone to much of her writing. She exudes effortless cool. It was a privilege to enter her inner sanctum and view her life and their shared love of art and her honouring Robert's dying wishes through these pages. By the end of this book I was completely emotionally invested in their love story and I believe she honoured it beautifully. This book is not perfect it has it's flaws but to me it's raw and unpolished and so very rock and roll."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"music: Durutti Column - ""Finding The Sea"" This is a picture of a friendship, a picture of the start of two careers, a tribute to friend that has died, a picture of a time lived (late 1960s to mid-1970s), a picture of that period New York - a ride all the way to the end, and several rides to Coney Island, some flights to Paris, and development of finding the right art form for oneself. Just the right length to read, makes you laugh, makes you sad. Patti's talent appears early as she wishes she could put more words in for a bird that is called 'swan', and Robert's shows in jewerly-making. Different homes, with Patti's being quite normal while Robert's is a place where emotions are hardly shown, though it's not a place completely empty of love. They meet when Patti moves bravely to New York without certainty where she will stay (and she does spend some time homeless). There is instant connection, and it keeps through all the ups and downs that follow. We get glimpese of other cultural world throughout the story: of seeing the Doors, Velvet Underground, Television. Visits to Max's Kansas City. Meeting people like Janis Joplin, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, Todd Rundgren, William S. Burroughs, Johnny Winter. All the events of those days, the deaths of Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, the four student in Ohio, etc. It's also interesting to read what Patti's visits to Paris (and visits to Rimbaud's burial place) are like. The move to the Chelsea Hotel, while no doubt distressing at first, turns out to be a good move for both persons' career: they meet useful people and develop friendships (and more) that lead to other things. It's also interesting to read how Robert gradually, painfully, finds his true self, though one gets a sense of danger (especially felt if you know how his life ends). On taking the picture for the cover of her album: "" "" Some lovely scenes stick to mind, like all those Coney Island trips, the night they play 100 singles in a row, dancing. The picture of a postcard made out of a target practice board. All the poems and pictures suit the story well, and move it on. The most moving part is, of course, the end. There is the last days of Robert, from 1986 to 1989. His struggles, her frequent visits to him, the last picture taken, ""our last picture"" (shown in the book). Going through his things after, not feeling good enough to buy things at auction... the best visual picture is when she visits a beach, watching the sky and contemplating their friendship - death doesn't stop it. """" You read and get to learn more about these two kids, and to love them. Death comes but feels just like a change in the viewing angle. There's always something out there, and you can read this book again like a good movie. You see two friends, hands held together."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I finished this one last week and have been thinking about it, debating my stars ever since. I picked this book due to the awards it received and also because it was one of the highest rated reads of 2010 by many sources including my library colleagues across the country. I'm not certain what I was expecting but it did not live up to the hype for me. And yet, I liked it. I could identify with the times as Patti Smith and I are just a few years apart in age. She and I shared many same experiences right down to earning $65 a week at our first real jobs. But then, somehow she lost me and I just couldn't relate to her life or style or poetry or song. All right, I'll admit I didn't even know who she was when the book was written but was an early follower of Robert Mapplethorpe and this, in the end is what redeemed the book for me. If not for my interest in him I think I wouldn't have even finished. I think I would have done better to read his bio. I honestly liked the story of their relationship and how these two, just kids, supported each other throughout their turbulent lives. Some would call them lovers, others soul mates; to me they were just two good friends. Friends who stood by each other for a lifetime. Who could ask for more?"
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Patti Smith is a legend. This memoir is a delight. Absolutely crucial for anyone interested in New York, the 60s and 70s, punk, art, music, poetry, and life. I had previously read the punk oral history tome of Please Kill Me, which had many interviews with Patti Smith about her seminal time at Max's Kansas City and CBGB's, and I thought I had a decent impression of her. I was aware of her music, and that she came from a poetry background. Little did I know how much heart and talent in writing she held. While Please Kill Me often aimed to shock, her own memoir Just Kids is full of soul and beauty. It is unapologetically sentimental, nothing wrong with that at all. There is the gay sex and occasional drugs and that sort of thing, but it's all told in such beautiful prose as simple parts of life. It's not about extremes, just getting at the root of what truly happens in one's love-filled memories... Costar of this memoir is photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. They were famously friends, starving artists together struggling (and by struggling it was really bad in those early years indeed) in New York until they made it big. Their first meet-cute as she was running away from an older man trying to take advantage, their shy courtship, adventures at the Chelsea Hotel, the path he took as he explored BDSM and became such a controversial artist which she wasn't even into. Though ultimately he wasn't her orientation, they truly seemed to be soulmates throughout their lives. The story jumps around, filled with so many precious details about New York in the 60s. When the punk era 70s come around, and Patti finds success, the stories then rush on by. Aside from a few excellent vignettes about how her most memorable songs were written, this particular part of her life is not really the point. She relishes in what made her an artist in the first place, rather than reliving the whole rock star life. In fact, the story if anything then kind of skips far away to the late 80s when Robert sadly contracted HIV and eventually passed. It's not fun, but it is what happened and that's the story to focus upon. These deep truths are what it's all about. This is the Patti Smith aesthetic, her writing craft, and it is a valid powerful work of art. Note: I listened to the audiobook edition, read by the author, which leaves me with such an impression. So anyway, throughout it all, from beginning to end, they were ultimately just that: Just Kids And as so eloquently said, one hopes, Paths That Cross Will Cross Again..."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"There are two reasons to read a memoir: 1. You know who the person is and are curious about them/their life story. 2. The person may be unknown to you, but their experiences are interesting and worth reading about. As a relatively sheltered person, I’m far more likely to read a memoir for the second reason. This is the case even when the memoir is written by someone famous and most people are reading it for the first reason. So I picked up “Just Kids” without any prior knowledge of Patti Smith or of Robert Mapplethorpe, figuring that a book which won the National Book Award, had a high average goodreads rating, appeared on Amazon’s Best of 2010 list (famous last words; I have now been disappointed by at least one out of every two books I read from that list) would be worthwhile in its own right. Sadly, this was not the case. Although a part of me enjoyed this foray into the world of being artsy and not caring if you know where your next meal is coming from, overall I felt very distanced from both Patti and Robert throughout the book. I never got a sense of Patti’s attraction to Robert or of the relationship dynamics. They basically starved while she worked to support them and they both devoted themselves to art. Okay. Now she needs some distance from him. Okay. Now he’s experimenting with being gay. Okay. Now she’s back with him. Okay. Now they’re living in a fleabag motel and his health is failing. Okay. Now he wants to be Andy Warhol. Okay. I got a lot of details – what people wore, what they ate, what they did, who they saw – but never a sense of what Patti was thinking or feeling during this time. I mean, I guess she loved Robert but I couldn’t really see why or how. Maybe I needed to know who Patti and Robert were in order to care about them. Certainly the book itself was not sufficient to make me care about them as people or engage me in learning about the course their lives took."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This may sound lame, but I read this book having very limited knowledge of Patti Smith. I picked it up as it got rave reviews and I needed a book by a musician for a challenge prompt. I picked up the audio version and Patti herself narrates it, which I always find a treat. I appreciated the candor of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe and the details of her life growing up as a young woman in the streets of NYC, her trip to Paris with her sister stands out and there were small vignettes that she writes so beautifully that the reader can't help but savor over the words. Interspersed with stories threaded together are photos of Patti and Robert that perfectly capture their bond. This felt like Patti's love letter to Robert and I enjoyed it. Ultimately, it lands right down the middle and this may just be attributed to the fact that I don't have context for this relationship. I think if you're a fan or aware of Patti and Robert this would be highly recommended reading. For me, it just felt like a story about some people that I should know, but don't. I feel like I need to do some research to prop up my investment in this title."

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The runaway artist is a typical phase of adolescence, and the true measure of one’s devotion to a creative life is the ability to sustain the kind of drive that can keep you going through the hunger, cold, loneliness and (perhaps worst of all) the disillusionment of adulthood. Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe had this drive in spades, although the route they used to reach their final goals can be seen as both fortuitous and questionable. The last thing an artist wants to be is a “sell out,” but then again, how do you get to make a living from art if you don’t meet the right people at the right time and make a name for yourself? Where is the line drawn between security and freedom? How much of one do you have to give up for the other? doesn’t necessarily answer any of these questions, at least not directly, but I kept thinking about them as I was reading. Although it is a memoir, I read for the same reason I read fiction: I wanted to experience something out of my reach, to use my imagination to enter a world that is not only closed to me, but in many ways may never have existed at all. Sorry to sound so enigmatic; what I mean is, though Patti Smith takes you on a trip to the early 70’s in New York, it is 70s, New York, and she is often rather oblique in her self-examination, and excessively generous in her descriptions of others. No one ever seems to do anything wrong, and even when they do, that’s ok because it’s all about freedom and art. Never mind sexually transmitted diseases or treading on anyone’s toes, it’s all about the elusive fame and fortune hovering just an exhibition away. I like Patti Smith, though coming into this book I knew very little about her. I knew she had been friends with Robert Mapplethorpe (who I knew a bit more about, thanks to my own time in art school), and that she was a proto-punk songwriter who had been one of Mapplethorpe’s original photography subjects. Her style is clear if a bit overwrought at times, and her devotion to Mapplethorpe while he struggled with his sexual identity, and later with AIDS, is very touching. I think the book is at its best when it describes the little moments of intense friendship between the two, and at its weakest when Smith finds it necessary to attribute so much of their success to fate and signs. Yes, there are often moments in life that seem fortuitous or somehow preordained, but Smith is a bit heavy with the symbolic meaning of little things. I really did like this book a great deal, as it allowed me to experience the kind of life I used to fantasize about when I was younger (and still think about now). To learn about the times or even Smith and Mapplethorpe themselves doesn’t really seem to be the point of this memoir; rather it is a memorial to a beloved friend and a tiny capsule capturing an intense and influential relationship between two great artists during a wildly exhilarating time in New York City, when Andy Warhol and Pop were on the way out, and Robert Mapplethorpe and punk rock were taking over. Good times."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"A few months ago, my husband asked me if I had any Patti Smith in my music collection. It made me laugh because I have A TON of Patti Smith in my music library. But it had fallen out of my regular rotation at some point, so I dug it all back up, and as I introduced Jason to the work of the high priestess of art-punk, I re-immersed myself in her weird, incantatory, hypnotic songs. Jason became a huge fan really quickly, and the flames of my love for this amazing lady were rekindled. I bought a copy of “Just Kids” as a gift for him, but ended up sneaking it off his shelf one evening when he was out with friends. Oh, Patti… When I thought I couldn’t love you more than I already did… She is eccentric, romantic, disarmingly honest, and while this book is dusted with a bit of sweet nostalgia, it was in no way saccharine. Just the story of two kids who met and fell in love in New York, when it was THE place to be for misfits and artists. ""Just Kids"" chronicles Patti's early years: her late teens and when she decided to leave the family home in South Jersey to go be an artist in New York. As she was wandering the city looking for a place to sleep, she met a young artist with wild curls and big green eyes: Robert Mapplethorpe. The pair quickly fell in love, in an almost fusional relationship, and teamed up to make a place for themselves in New York's prolific art scene. I knew Robert Mapplethorpe's photography, but I didn't know anything about his life: Smith paints a loving memorial to the man she describes as ""the artist of her life"", a man she was had an unwavering loyalty for, and whom she supported through both artistic experiments, as well as intense self and sexual discovery. While the pair loved each other very strongly, the sentiment evolved from romantic into an incredible bond of friendship and camaraderie; an intimacy that would survive drugs, many different partners and all the things you'd expect to happen to someone who lived at that exact time and place. Because a story like that really could never have taken place anywhere else, at any other point in history. With a simple but gorgeous prose, she makes the bohemian squalor of broke artists' living situation sound romantic, and she candidly acknowledges that in their youthful exuberance, they often didn't consider the potential consequences of their actions, and that they didn't think much of some irresponsible behavior. You can shake your head at her stories, but it is impossible to judge her. As the title reminds us, they were just kids, being artists and trying life on until they found a way to live that fit them. This is a beautiful story of friendship, peppered with some anecdotes about the New York art scene you just can't make up, all written in Smith's erudite and sometimes whimsical style. A must for any fan of the great lady. I need to read “M Train” now!"
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I perhaps came to this book from an odd direction. I wasn’t a fan of Patti Smith’s music, poetry, or art, and I honestly had not even heard of Robert Mapplethorpe beforehand, much less seen any of his photographs. Instead, I picked up this book because I have been reading about New York musicians, and Patti Smith certainly fit that description. It is a great testament to her writing, then, that I found this memoir entirely compelling. On its own terms, simply as a story, this is a beautiful book. Though Smith does narrate her own artistic journey—from drawing, to poetry, to music, and eventually to fame—the main focus of the memoir is her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. They begin as lovers, though it is an awkward fit for many reasons (Mapplethorpe’s sexuality among them). Yet the basis of their relationship is never sexual, but artistic. The two of them are born artists—people who know that they want to create, even if they don’t know what, or how, or why. Mutual admiration, coupled with deep affection, are what tie them together as they develop their artistic voices and scrape by on odd jobs. The artistic Bildungsroman is, of course, a classic story, told and retold ad infinitum. Likewise for the coming-of-age in NYC story. What makes Patti Smith’s version great is her writing. Unlike Bob Dylan’s memoir, which is about as guarded as the genre can be, this book is intimate, personal, and loving. She loves the people, the places, the memories, and takes care to do justice to each one. And she is expert at conjuring up images of the past that take you back in time—details of clothing or decoration, descriptions of knickknacks and dirty apartments. No part of the book overstays its welcome, and it is written with perfect ease. By now, I can say that I am a Patti Smith fan."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"After discovering the arts at a very young age Patti dreamed of not only becoming an artist herself but to find a partner to share inspiration with. At age 20, on her first day as a New Yorker she found just that. Patti and Robert immediately hit it off and were soon living together, working side by side. Patti and Robert were your typical young, starving artists, creating nonstop and earning just enough to scrape by. Money may have been sparse but they had all they needed in each other. “One cannot imagine the mutual happiness we felt when we sat and drew together. We would get lost for hours.” Together they made a vow to never leave the other until both felt ready to stand on their own. Over time their relationship would begin to shift, but their bond remained strong. Robert began to explore his interest in men and while that initially came as a shock to Patti she always supported him through that journey. “His drives toward men were consuming but I never felt loved any less. We kept our vow, neither would leave the other. I never saw him through the lens of his sexuality. My picture of him remained intact. He was the artist of my life.” Patti also began to date others and had memorable relationships with fellow writers Jim Carroll and Sam Shepard. In those early years when Patti and Robert weren’t busy working in their tiny apartment at the legendary Chelsea Hotel one could find them downstairs at the El Quixote or in the back room of Max’s Kansas City, mingling with fellow artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Bobby Neuwirth, Todd Rundgren and the Warhol Crowd. Neither had yet found the medium they would become most known for, but each seemed to be able to sense where the other belonged with Patti constantly encouraging Robert to pick up a camera and take photos and Robert trying his hardest to get Patti to perform her poetry onstage. They never gave up on their art or each other and soon each began to find success. Robert finally did pick up that camera and started getting shows at galleries while Patti began to perform at poetry readings with Lenny Kaye on guitar beside her. Not only did that lead to Patti getting her poetry published, she also realized the stage is where she belonged and officially formed a band. Each came into their own and succeeded in their vow. The night before Robert passed away Patti made one last vow. “I told him I would continue our work, our collaboration, for as long as I lived. Will you write our story? Do you want me to? You have to, he said, no one but you can write it. I will do it I promised.” In 2010 Patti fulfilled that promise and Just Kids was published. It is an incredibly touching, beautifully written love letter to Robert and their time together.

Of Mapplethorpe and Smith's relationship, I'll only say that I found it sweet and sad. Other things interested me about this book more. I have to agree with Yahaira, it was both annoying and great. The starving artist / wannabe might be a phase lots of kids and young people went through before they turned into responsible adults, but it is one I skipped entirely, so yeah, while I found some of the writing and the subjects irritating, I thought this was a fascinating portal into the successful incubation of a couple of artists who may or may not have been remarkably talented, but were undeniably successful. Like No Direction Home, the documentary about Bob Dylan, Just Kids left me thinking that maybe the most important factor in this kind of artistic / commercial success is being in the right place at the right time. It's not that I think Dylan or Smith or Mapplethorpe were not talented, but I'm just not convinced that in their natural state, outside of that environment, any of them possessed much more genius than anyone else--or at least not as much genius as is attributed to each of them today. Other contributing factors: the related factor of meeting the right people, and time, lots of time for ideas to incubate, which means not really having a job or the overwhelming (and middle-class) sense of obligation and responsibility that drives some of us to feel that we have to eat or have a roof over our heads. It did surprise me how materialistic (and I don't mean that in the yuppie sense) Smith was - a total magpie. It was also interesting how much she recalled and wrote about what she or Mapplethorpe wore. Both she and Mapplethorpe reminded me a lot of those characters in Sartre's writings who were meant to be foils for existentialism: people obsessed with creating ""situations,"" seeing life as one big performance. Now, existentialism is one phase I *did* go through. Maybe it's the wannabe phase for hyper-rational, hyper-analytical kids like me. In a way, it pushed me to become a teacher after college, to want to *do* something in the world. As much as I've always wished I had the talent to be an artist, it's possible that I never could have been one anyway, for having the wrong philosophy."

I have never heard of Patti Smith before learning about this book. After finishing it, I really want to go check out her other works (books, music and drawings). She's a fascinating person! She wrote a song for Janis Joplin right before she passed away, Met Jimi Hendrix, did a song with Bruce Springsteen. Like, she has accomplished A LOT in her lifetime, and those were just SOME of the examples. This book really tugged at my heartstrings. It is evident that Smith wrote this book with unconditional love and passion. This book is dedicated to not only how Smith grew up and how she accomplished fame, but it also chronicles her relationship with the first person she made a genuine connection to when she moved to New York: Richard Mapplethorpe. It tales their ups and downs, their trials and tribulations, their love for each other and love for each other's work and art. I caught myself tearing up at some points. Patti Smith's writing is like nothing I've ever experienced. It's lyrical and beautiful, but it contains some raw and gritty elements as well. Emotion just pours out of every sentence. It seems like Smith had a meaning for every word that was used in this book. It was just beautiful! I genuinely don't know what else to say haha. You really just have to go out and read this book. This did take me while to get through, but I enjoyed every time I picked it up. Patti Smith is officially in my top writers club now!"

Here's a story about all the famous people I met during my climb to fame as a poet/rock musician. A story of me living in my own head as a struggling artist. A story about my philosophical ponderings over the purpose of art. Oh by the way here are some more famous people I bumped into in the beautiful wild craze that was New York in the 70s. Here are 101 other excuses that all point to me using my youth as an excuse for not taking responsibility for my actions and hurting people. I am a beatnik. Of course it's safe to assume that you already know all of this because I am so famous, which is why going into the book I will provide no direction or introduction to the broader context of what was going on in my life or to the various famous people I will frolic with. If you're lost throughout the book that's your own fault you cultureless ninny. OR WAIT!?! Perhaps you are not well affiliated with white american culture from 5 decades ago? To hell with you anyways, my life needs no explanation. -_- I really liked disliking this book if that wasn't clear. I used google a lot and not in a good way I think and I gained very little. I can appreciate art, but I think my science brain couldn't stand a lot of the spiritual meaning seeking that was underpinning the whole vibe of the book."

I read the greek translation by Aleksis Kalofolias*, translator, bassist and vocalist of the legendary greek punk rock band The Last Drive, whom I had the pleasure to see live at a festival in my town a few months back. I think there could hardly be a more suitable person to take over the task of introducing Patti Smith's work to the greek audience. Not only did he do a hell of a job, he also provided a plethora of information on pretty much every name mentioned in the book. Great, great work! As for the book itself, it's an account of Smith's progress in becoming one of the most acknowledged figures of rock art, focusing on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorp, the photographer who influenced her art and personality more than anyone. Her prose is flat most of the time, with sudden outbursts of lyricism and sentiment that seem to leak from the pages. Does she sugar-coat her relationship with Robert? I think it may look like she does but she practically doesn't. Yes, it all looks taken out of a romance novel but we're talking about the 60's and 70's in New York! What's more, don't we all tend to sprinkle fairy dust on our most precious memories? Besides, she doesn't hesitate to analyze the turbulences caused by Robert's sentimental instability. All the references, the poetry, the wild atmosphere of one of the wildest periods in modern history and, of course, Smith's prose made this book a perfect read for me and a thesaurus of knowledge on many subjects. *Ο Αλέξης Καλοφωλιάς έχει επίσης αναλάβει την μετάφραση για την επανακυκλοφορία του Fight Club, καθώς και την μετάφραση του M Train της Patti Smith."

In this treasure, Patti recounts her chance meeting of Robert as soon as she arrived in New York in the late 1960s. In less than 300 pages, she composes a beautiful love letter to the man who would immediately become her best friend, muse, protector, lover and, in many ways, soulmate. In the memories she shares, readers get an intimate glance into deep suffering that sometimes transmutes into brilliant and luminary artistry. The stories are so fantastic that she even compares their adventures to those of Hansel and Gretl, full of mystery, danger and a desperate need for freedom. Along the way, readers get fleeting glimpes into fated encounters with the likes of Andy Warhol, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix, essentially lining the path of Patti's and Robert's rise to fame with crumbs of stardust. Beautiful and inspiring, Just Kids reads like fiction; and while the stories are all true, it is indeed the stuff of legends."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This spare, elegiac memoir about Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith has something of the Christian iconography about it: if words were installations, one can imagine an altarpiece with the Virgin Mary and perhaps a crucifix surrounded by velvet, feathers, bits of lace, and little skull beads…not kitschy, but strong, puzzling, edgy. Patti Smith is a force, though perhaps one might say she is the negative to Mapplethorpe's positive in the first part of the book: the black negative to Mapplethorpe’s clear clean photograph. In the last half of the book, Smith herself is the positive and lighter image, and entirely clear. And what an unforgettable picture it is. Smith and Mapplethorpe were soulmates, and she accepted him unconditionally. That closeness and lack of criticism gave them both room to develop in a environment of mutual trust. Even if Smith didn’t agree with, nor completely understand, the impulses that ruled Mapplethorpe she was his first proponent. She grew into her own art even as it grew in her. She was often unsure of the work, but not of the path. By now she might be considered a swami for the equilibrium she exhibits in writing this book. is the first song on her new album, , out in 2012, and in it she says “they called us Caribe, which means men of great wisdom…” Perhaps only now can she say that, but she has earned it. I loved reading of those moments when one change (in appearance, friends, or piece of art) made an enormous difference in how Smith or Mapplethorpe were perceived. She makes it sounds like a chemical reaction–that moment a salt solution becomes crystal. Her sound is even better for my knowing her history. A life in the pursuit of art is something extraordinary, and this telling of it is breathtakingly lovely and clear and spare. Not the life, especially, but the telling of it. Perhaps Mapplethorpe and Smith were destined to meet, but imagine for a moment they did not. Smith was perhaps the less fragile. We can’t help but wonder at the path they took and how, necessarily influenced by externals as we all are, things would have been for them in a different constellation. Great read."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I've been looking at this book with interest for probably over ten years, but never got around to it. I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and there was nothing interesting to listen to over a holiday weekend, so that sent me looking for an audiobook from the library. I chose (finally) this one. Honestly, the only thing I knew about Patti Smith is her song ""Because the Night"" from the early eighties. However, she seems to be respected in the artistic community and an intriguing figure, so I delved in. I had presumed the picture on the bookcover was her and her brother because of the title, but it was Patti and her best friend/lover/inspiration...Robert Mapplethorpe. I had a vague notion of that name as being a controversial artist in the NYC area. Apparently, these two souls met up on the streets of NYC in the late sixties while she was working at a bookstore and barely surviving. Their union wound up being a cataclysmic event, as they inspired each other artistically and shared a profound bond with each other. They lived together, sometimes as friends, other times as lovers, but always vowing to be there for each other as they struggled to make it with their art. I loved hearing about their survival skills in acquiring living/working spaces to persue their art, making the most of such meager finances. I also marveled at what Patti always referred reverently as ""their work"", as it could be most anything...poetry, drawings, jewelry making, photography, acting, songwriting. It was quite by accident that Patti found her fame fronting a band, but she was always going to be an artist no matter what the spectrum. Patti's narration lended such authenticity to her prose, with her enduring love and admiration for artistic mentor Robert Mapplethorpe, who died in 1989. Patti had promised Robert she would tell their story, and she succeeded with making it a touching and meaningful remembrance."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I cried on the subway this morning. I didn't care who saw or what they thought. Why did I cry? Because Robert Mapplethorpe died. And yes, I'm aware that this happened years ago. I'm even more aware that his death is the opening scene of Patti Smith's spectacular memoir . But by the time I got to the end, after reading about their lives together and apart, about everything they endured, attempted, pushed for and strained to grasp throughout their long friendship, I'd felt like I'd lost a friend too. Smith's beautiful prose leads you through her twisted path, starting in New Jersey and stretching through Paris, New York, and points other, ranging from the late sixties to the late eighties. She may drop names of celebrities, but if I was lucky enough to have traded tales of heartbreak with Janis Joplin or stories of shyness with Jimi Hendrix at the Chelsea Hotel, I'd write about that, too. Every so often she gets a little bogged down in recounting small details, but that's very rare. The small details, the day-to-day regularities, and unglamorous moments are what make . At the end, you feel like you knew them, maybe just a little. She holds just enough back to make you wish she'd written more. I live in hope for another memoir. Until then, this is heavily recommended."

They were very young when they met, they sought for the way to express the artistic nature they both had. Having New York as the third main character, this was the most beautiful part of the book. Then they grew apart (""We become ourselves"") but stayed connected until Robert's death. I have never thought much about Patti Smith. I listened only to ""Horses"". Now I am impressed by how natural and wise, how intuitive and genuine she seems to be. She became mature on her own terms and no matter how artistic she's been, she has led a rather straight life. Her prose might be conventional but her insight is remarkable."

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Wow. What a fantastically written and compelling book. True confession time: I honestly didn't know much about Patti Smith, save her song ""Because the Night,"" and I didn't know much about the artist Robert Mapplethorpe, except for the controversy much of his work generated. I also had no idea that Smith and Mapplethorpe had a more than 20-year friendship that inspired both of their artistic careers to flourish. But I had heard wonderful things about Smith's memoir, Just Kids (it recently won the National Book Award), so I thought I'd give the book a shot and perhaps learn something new as well. Smith is a tremendously gifted writer. As she unfolds the story of her friendship with Mapplethorpe and her struggle to find herself and realize her place in the artistic community, her narrative has an almost poetic quality. This was a relationship that flourished in the early 1970s, a very creative, wild time, and Smith truly evoked imagery of that era, empathy as both she and Mapplethorpe struggled to find their artistic footing (while finding the money to survive), and both beauty and anguish in her description of their relationship. This is an inspirational and heartbreaking story about a way of life that really no longer exists, and the story provides insight into two true icons. Don't be put off if you don't know much about either Smith or Mapplethorpe—you'll find yourself drawn to the narrative that Smith has woven."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm sad to learn that Patti Smith's artistic background is largely that of an aesthete, not the indelicate, androgynous, full throttle-but-poetic mother of punk that she is in my head. She and Robert are pre-millenial hipsters and this book is as much an ode to the lifestyle of mingling among big name artists of the late 60's and early 70's as it is to their friendship. Though I suppose those two things are heavily intertwined. My co-worker's 21 year old daughter also read this book. She loves Patti Smith too. And I think she's the ideal audience for : people who are also going through the time of their life when beautiful objects have mystical, absolute significance and are worth the spending of your lunch money and starving for a day; when it's not kinda grating to want to converse about ""Rimbaud, archaeology, and abstract art""; when you're at the age where you can still make friends by running down alleys with semi-strangers to escape a bad date. I appreciate her earnestness, but this is not a book that resonates very much with me. I still love her music."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I must confess I'm very immune to a poetry - usually it doesn't touch my stone cold heart and I keep away from it. Not like I can't appreciate it, yes I can. I just don't give a damn. That's one of the reasons I didn't ever care much about Patti Smith as of a VIP of some sorts. I knew there was Patti and her poetry and her music. So what? But a friend recommended this book to me and I got curious. I'm glad she did. I was reading it almost non stop since I started and I feel like I lived through it, a little bit. There must be something powerful in between those lines, if it's not a poetry itself, then it must be magic. Before the last chapter I checked a lot of Robert's photography and then, when reading that last chapter it hit me with a new strength. It was almost too painful too read. Patti gave such a beautiful and honest tribute to Robert in this book, it's really hard to explain the bitter-sweetness of the experience of reading. So I will leave it like this. Smoke and mirrors."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Just kids is essentially a diary that divulges Patti’s early 20s that explore various themes regarding art, friendship, lovers, and innumerable encounters during her 20s. It’s an ode to the bygone revered poets, a love letter to chelsea hotel, and an elegy for her ex-lover/ a lifelong companion, Robert Mapplethorpe. Patti shares her experience as a 20 something in nyc, contending with poverty and feeling lost. In some ways, i could resonate with young Patti, grappling to navigate life faced with countless obstacles. This memoir is imbued with hints of nostalgia and poignancy, but it’s not a sad story. It’s rather an inspirational story about the beautiful souls she’d met during the 70s’; her unwavering passion towards rock and roll and ultimately, unfiltered accounts of her youth. If you haven’t had the chance to read this impeccable memoir, i highly suggest it!"

You drew me from the darkest period of my young life, sharing with me the sacred mystery of what it is to be an artist. -Letter from Patti to Robert This is dually an autobiography of the adult life of Patti Smith and a biography of that of Robert Mapplethorpe. The two met in New York (when New York actually meant something) in their early 20s; they didn't know they were looking for each other, but it happened, and they never separated, not really. It's basically what every young person wants in their life, even if they don't admit it. There's something really romantic here, and Patti does a wonderful job of expressing what their relationship meant to her. For a poet and a songwriter, I actually expected more from her writing. This was not really a good example of quality writing - it was sort of disjointed in parts, and all of a sudden there are people mentioned that weren't previously. But the more I read these sorts of books (musician autobiographies, specifically), I'm beginning to realize that this is par for the course. In many cases so much time has passed and the memories may not entirely be intact; or the memories may be intact, but viewed through rose-colored lenses now; or the bad parts are downplayed to protect the innocent and/or deceased. But as I read along, I decided that I really didn't care about any of that. I enjoyed the story. I fell in love with Smith's account of her bohemian experience in New York in the late 60s throughout the 70s. I wanted to know her and Robert Mapplethorpe, together, the way they were when they were just puppies. I for one forgot that they seriously puppies when they first fell in love. The pictures Smith chooses to share throughout the book illustrate that very well. These are young faces. And it's heartbreaking in a way because they so young here, and you know they will never be together again in this way, not really. But beyond that it actually makes you realize that will never be that young again. You will never have that feeling of being a young 20-something again when everything is so fresh and exciting and these sorts of relationships are the most magical and important things in your entire life. I don't mean this in a condescending way at all; we've all been there, and we can't go back, but it's okay because this is a good age too, whatever your age is. I'm saying all the ages have all the pros. (And cons. Let's not get too overly sentimental here, shall we?) I loved this. I really did. I felt it all, everything Patti wanted me to feel. I am happy that she had Robert in her life, and that he had Patti. They needed each other in a not-entirely-codependent way. I mean, this sounded relatively healthy. They grew together, they grew apart-together, and no matter what happened or where they went, they continued to grow and they never stopped loving one another. There's something pretty admirable in that alone, because it ain't easy. I'm sure there are things Patti didn't share with us, and that's cool because she is the Godmother of Punk and she can do whatever the fuck she wants. Oh, and there's some stuff about art and music too. That stuff was interesting as well. But seriously, they were the hottest."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Just Kids is rock stark/poet Patti Smith's memoir of her early days with Robert Maplethorpe in New York City. After a relatively brief descript of her growing up, Smith moves (literally and metaphorically) to NYC. It's the late '60s artist/musician world, the world of Max's Kansas City and Andy Warhol, of William Boroughs and the Chelsea Hotel, and just about every famous poet/musician of the time passes through these pages. For me, the book was both a nostalgic trip to a time long-gone that I remember so well and a revelation of the people and their work that were a major result and creators of the art and culture of that time. Smith meets Maplethorpe soon after her arrival and the two immediately become friends and lovers. Their's is a relationship that survives his discovery of his true sexual identity to become, sometimes painfully, friends and supporters of each other's work. I could barely put this book down. I found it mesmerizing and wonderful. I recommend it to anyone interested in the 1960's-1970's, the New York art scene, downtown culture, rock 'n roll, and good writing. So, I think, to everybody."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I think she's really good at writing about intimacy. Other things she's not as good at. But there were some truly magical moments in the first 100 pages or so. That said, there is something of this personal myth-making that makes me uneasy... it is both sincere and totally constructed at the same time. Something about how she retro-actively makes everything seem so fated, with all the right coincidences and people coming in at the right times (makes for a great story though). So many things are romanticized here, not just the love story, which would be obvious, but also the art scene, New York City at that time, the Chelsea Hotel, and the many artists that came and went. This isn't really a complaint, since that is the reason most of us are reading this book to begin with, me included, i.e. we want our romantic notions reaffirmed. It also satisfied my voyeuristic side to read about what books she was reading/music she was listening to/films she was watching at different stages of her life. Probably if a book were published of interesting people and what media they've consumed at different stages of life, that would be endlessly interesting to me."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Let’s get the autobiographical details out of the way first, shall we? When I first began to get into punk music back in 1978 or so, Patti Smith quickly became one of my favorite artists. She was most certainly one of the main drivers of the New York scene, and yet she was more than that. She had met Hendrix, had been fascinated with John Cale and Nico and the rest of the Velvets, she sauntered around with Lou Reed, and she ended up getting married to Fred “Sonic” Smith, one of the members of the proto-punk-metal band The MC5. Smith was THE link between the bohemian and art-driven late ‘60s and the DIY ethic of the punk scene in the mid ‘70s. Equal parts singer, poetess, and performance artist, her work was challenging and not easy to categorize. Hell, her first radio hit was a cover of “Because the Night,” a Bruce Springsteen jam. Her presence elevated punk rock beyond its inherent limitations and gave the burgeoning musical form some much needed legitimacy and commercial appeal. “Just Kids” was originally published in 2010, and it won a slew of literary awards including the 2010 National Book Award for Nonfiction. It’s not an autobiography in the strictest sense, though Smith does detail a lot of her experiences growing up and finding herself as an artist. “Just Kids” is instead a reflection on and a love letter to Robert Mapplethorpe, with whom she had a personal relationship with for a period of about five years from 1967 to 1972. Mapplethorpe would eventually become a famous and very controversial photographer on the New York and world scene. His later works would become a lightning rod for obscenity cases in numerous jurisdictions both in the United States and overseas in England. Mapplethorpe’s depictions of the nude female and male bodies could be both beautiful and disturbing, though it was his pieces that depicted the gay and BDSM cultures of New York City that would gain him the most attention. Robert Mapplethorpe died in 1989 of complications from the HIV/AIDS virus. You can read more about his life and works on his Wiki page: “Just Kids” is a beautifully written book, and Patti Smith does an excellent job of evoking what her life was like when she was attached to Robert. She first meets him when she was working as a clerk in the uptown branch of Brentano’s, a New York bookstore with two locations. She meets him again not too long after when he rescues her from a disastrous date with a science-fiction writer. They run off into the night together and it isn’t long before the stars begin to align for the couple. He shows Patti his art, his sketchings. They soon move in together, all hippie chic and beads and candles and shredded dungarees. But it isn’t long before trouble hits the new couple. Patti moves from her job at Brentano’s to the better paying and more prestigious Scribners. Robert quits his part-time job and eventually makes a move to San Francisco for a time, where he reveals his homosexuality to Patti in somewhat awkward fashion. They ultimately reunite and remain friends and a marginal couple as his career begins to take shape at the hands of various lovers and patrons. I surely cannot capture the evocative turns of Smith’s prose-poetry in this book. She brings her artist’s eye to the entire affair, and the stark black and white photography within is an added bonus, allowing the reader to have a visual reference for the subjects at hand. Smith’s chiseled beauty herein cannot be measured by traditional social standards, her body and frame itself a canvas on which she displayed her art in subtle and not so subtle ways. The lazy reviewer often resorts to quotes from books to fill space, but as I cannot hope to match Smith’s beautiful writing style, I will defer to her for a bit. “There were days, rainy gray days, when the streets of Brooklyn were worthy of a photograph, every window the lens of a Leica, the view grainy and immobile. We gathered our colored pencils and sheets of paper and drew like wild, feral children into the night, until, exhausted, we fell into bed. We lay in each other's arms, still awkward but happy, exchanging breathless kisses into sleep.” “We were walking toward the fountain, the epicenter of activity, when an older couple stopped and openly observed us. Robert enjoyed being noticed, and he affectionately squeezed my hand. ""Oh, take their picture,"" said the woman to her bemused husband, ""I think they're artists."" ""Oh, go on,"" he shrugged. ""They're just kids.” “Yet you could feel a vibration in the air, a sense of hastening. It had started with the moon, inaccessible poem that it was. Now men had walked upon it, rubber treads on a pearl of the gods. Perhaps it was an awareness of time passing, the last summer of the decade. Sometimes I just wanted to raise my hands and stop. But stop what? Maybe just growing up.” And perhaps my favorite quote, and the most haunting in the book….. “So my last image was as the first. A sleeping youth cloaked in light, who opened his eyes with a smile of recognition for someone who had never been a stranger.” Yeah, I hate to rely too much on the “quote tactic” when I’m writing a review, but I seem to do that sometimes when I am faced with trying to bring my meager talents as a writer up to par when it comes to describing a book. “Just Kids” begins and ends with Mapplethorpe dying in 1989. Smith follows his career all the way to the end with love and sympathy, always there for her friend and former lover, even as he veered from turmoil to turmoil in the latter days of his existence. Some of Mapplethorpe’s work will always be seen as obscene to some, but his talent could not be denied. Even his still shots of flowers evinced an air of eroticism and beauty that stood out and made them speak on a level that few other photographers could ever achieve. I mentioned earlier in this review that this might be less a book and more like a long form love letter to a lost lover, and I think that is a pretty apt description of “Just Kids.” Mapplethorpe made Patti Smith promise to write their story when he was on his deathbed. This she agreed to, and here is the result. Memorial Poem: As there is strength in blackness a deep control a calla flare trumpets grace corporeal there is a steady hand adjusting child lace and bravery’s face in veil inviolate there is a steady hand adept in heavens skin spending into black where pure hearts are kin.

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What a sweet little book this is! About friendship, art, rock and roll, love, the 60s, youth, poetry and so much more. I know Patti Smith, the musician and I was yet to be introduced to Patti Smith, the storyteller, the poet, the art lover, the artist, empath, the friend. And I was. It was pleasant meeting her. Not face to face but through this book which acted as a time capsule of sorts of a place and moment in history, during the 60s and 70s when rock and roll was still finding its footing, new possibilities in regards to sexuality were emerging and the key players of a generation such as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Allen Ginsberg, Candy Darling, Andy Warhol are given their fair share of the spotlight. But at the heart of this book, are two young artists who came from nothing but from sheer force of will were able to make something of themselves. To become the voice of a generation whether they intentionally wanted to or not. They etched their names in our culture's zeitgeist through their work that was rife with youthful rebellion and artistic reinvention. Culture was shifting and they were shifting right along with it. And Patti, the writer is documenting every second of it. Both the artist and the muse of her sometime lover and friend, Robert, her memories of him are at their sharpest and explore the complexities of what it means to be a human, most especially the need to be understood and validated by your peers. I really felt something tug at my heart every time she wrote about Robert Mapplethorpe, the artist and the person. She humanized him as well as mythologized him. Even though after reading this, I may never really know Robert Mapplethorpe as a person, I still feel grateful that he was seen for who he really was and what he represented to those who loved and admired his work. I will end with some of my favourite quotes from the book: ""The artist seeks contact with his intuitive sense of the gods, but in order to create his work, he cannot stay in this seductive and incorporeal realm. He must return to the material world in order to do his work. It's the artist's responsibility to balance mystical communication and the labor of creation."" ""We feared that the music which had given us sustenance was in danger of spiritual starvation. We feared it falling into fattened hands, we feared it floundering in a mire of spectacle, finance, and vapid technical complexity. We would call forth in our minds the image of Paul Revere, riding through the American night, petitioning the people to wake up, to take up arms. We too would take up arms , the arms of our generation, the electric guitar and the microphone."" ""In my low periods, I wondered what was the point of creating art. For whom? Are we animating God? Are we talking to ourselves? And what was the ultimate goal? To have one's work caged in art's great zoos-the Modern, the Met, the Louvre? I craved honesty, yet found dishonesty in myself. Why commit to art? For self-realization, or for itself? It seemed indulgent to add to glut unless one offered illumination."" ""It is said that children do not distinguish between living and inanimate objects; I believe they do. A child imparts a doll or tin solider with magical life-breath. The artist animates his work as the child his toys. Robert infused objects, whether for art or life, with his creative impulse, his sacred sexual power. He transformed a ring of keys, a kitchen knife, or a simple wooden frame into art. He loved his work and he loved his things. He once traded a drawing for a pair of riding boots-completely impractical, but almost spiritually beautiful."""
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I feel kind of bad about how much I disliked this book, mostly because the friend who recommended it to me could not say enough about it. I enjoy writing (as a hobby, not professionally), and have taken many writing classes, and this memoir for me was a very good example of bad writing and what to avoid. I have no doubt that if Smith were not famous, and if she had not written about her relationship with Maplethorpe, she would never have sold a single copy of this book. Just Kids is appropriately titled, as Smith writes this book the way a teenager would, in a very clunky and immature way that doesn't really enlighten the reader about its characters or compel one to read any further. In the beginning of the book, Smith talks about giving up a child for adoption in a time when it was scandalous for a teenager to give birth out of wedlock. I wanted to know more about how that made her feel and how that drove her or how she used her grief in her work, but she offers next to nothing in that regard. She drops that story and never returns to it, not even when she mentions the birth of her future children with her husband, Fred. I do not know most of the names Smith was so happy to drop left and right, most of whom seemed insignificant, as she never really explored her relationships with them or offered anything about them at all (with the exception of a short fling with Sam Shepherd, that I definitely wanted to hear more about). I do not get a sense of who Smith is from reading this, and her narrative voice is so passive and dull, that I wondered how she could have ever become famous for art or poetry or music. I had never listened to her music and so I downloaded Horses and while I did not enjoy listening to the music, I could see that it might be appealing to watch in a live performance, as a lot of it sounded very angry and passionate. Perhaps if she had written this book with the same passion and anger, with the voice of the woman who wrote those songs, I would have enjoyed it a lot more, and found the work relatable."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm sure, were I to put the microscope to this, that I might find something to grouse about; perhaps wonder aloud why I would want to read a memoir by a singer-songwriter that barely says anything about her years as a singer-songwriter; that during its course has a certain repetitive feel and not a little mawkishness; that might make me feel compelled to down a shot every time Smith reminds us that she is an artiste, thus becoming bloody well smashed. However, that would be petty, and a denial of the author's purpose. It's a lovely book, and it's best read as a heartfelt love letter to a lost soulmate; appreciated further as a vivid history of the arts scene in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. You read the book and you can feel the leather that Patti and Robert wore and smell the must in their artistic bungalows. You feel the pull that young Jersey boys and girls from the Brill Building era felt for that mesmerizing array of stars otherwise known as the lights of Manhattan. It's interesting to read a book about the 1960s and 1970s that's largely apolitical, that describes the mostly mundane world of the starving artist divorced from the usual aquarian context. Somehow, that makes it feel more real. Smith, as in a good deal of her young life, does not strive for epic significance. She strives for poetry, and I think she succeeds."

That's probably why I googled something every five pages or so: artists, musicians, poems, Robert's art, Patty's album covers and lyrics a.s.o. I never wished to be an artist of any kind, but if I did, I wish I had their courage, innocence and commitment. And that wonderful and deep friendship."

Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"2.5 stars Most of this book is basically a series of lists, told and re-told and then told again, in great detail: 1. The people they met 2. The food they ate 3. The clothes they wore 4. The places they lived 5. The things they owned 6. The progression of their art, and how they were influenced by each other and by other people. The first five categories are of little interest to me; this caused huge swathes of the book to feel very tedious. (“Usually he got the hot dog and I got the sauerkraut, but this time we had enough money for two hotdogs!”) Don’t get me wrong, this is an invaluable record of a unique part of American history and music, and should be read by anyone studying this time. But for someone like me – a casual reader who happens to be a fan of Robert Mapplethorpe and who loves excellent memoirs – this did not fall into my wheelhouse. I can’t believe this won the National Book Award for non-fiction in 2010. I’m beginning to think that any book prize is a sign that I should NOT read that book! The story as it’s told leaves me with the impression that Smith just sort of fell into her career, which I find hard to believe. She drops out of college because of an accidental pregnancy, and then she moves to NYC without any plan in place or even any place to live, and she picks up odd jobs while couch surfing in friends’ apartments, with no particular goals; gradually she finds steady (minimum wage?) employment, and she and Mapplethorpe live in one dive after another (with head lice! Don’t forget the head lice!), aimlessly creating drawings and collages, and they just sort of happen to meet the right people and end up successful. If I had to boil it all down to one sentence, it would be: anyone can become a successful artist so long as they don’t mind head lice and they don’t overdose. This is frustrating, because Patti Smith is an iconic figure, and I can’t believe she just sort of fell into that role. Despite the tedium of the endless lists, the thing that bothers me most about this book is that it doesn’t seem to know what it wants to be. Is it a memoir of Patti Smith’s early life? A book about the relationship between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe? A book about Mapplethorpe’s early life? A book about the NYC music and literature scene in the early 1970s? A book about Rimbaud’s legacy and effect on 20th Century American music and literature? (I know that seems like a reach, but read the book and note all the Rimbaud references – not such a reach.) It bounces between themes and characters as it goes from chapter to chapter, paragraph to paragraph. I never get a good feel of Mapplethorpe’s inner thoughts and feelings, so if it’s meant to be about him, it falls short. And, while Smith does talk about her own feelings at times, I never really feel like I get to know her, I don’t understand her goals or her motivations. So even as a memoir it falls short. Smith is appealingly honest, and incredibly detailed (see mention of tedium, above), but I never really felt like I was there with her. I thought listening to the audiobook would be an exceptionally vibrant experience, but it really is not. For a singer and a poet, Smith’s prose-reading style is remarkably monotonous. (She sings a song at one point, and that was breathtaking! The rest, very humdrum.) I don’t find the prose to be especially lyrical or luminous, it has no flow, it is just, “I bought this unconstructed rubberized silk raincoat and this hat and packed this necklace and we ate this grilled cheese,” and wow, I could use a little more insight into how all these things connect, and what it really meant to her, and how she felt about it, and how it affected her. I doubt she went through life in a daze, but that’s how it feels when I listen to this. This book in no way let me know how it felt to be there at that time; on the contrary, I felt like I was out on the sidewalk looking in at a display in a department store window, because I felt both removed from the scene, and as if the scene itself was no longer real or vibrant, but just a facsimile. And that’s fine. I in no way deserve to know Patti Smith’s inner life. But if I’m going to read her memoir, I don’t want it to feel like it’s a department store window display. It's only in the last section, which leaps forward in time to after Robert is diagnosed with AIDS and is dying, that I really sat up and took notice. It is vibrant, engaging, and deeply emotional. This section was far more powerful than I was expecting. Here, we learn that Robert asked Patti to write their story. Here, Ms Smith's voice loses its oddly monotonous tone. Here, she dispenses with the tedious lists of objects, and instead really describes the people, their feelings, their interactions and motivations. This is what I thought the entire book would be. I'm left to wonder if perhaps Ms Smith wrote this last section first, and then, in an effort to fulfill her entire promise, she wrote the rest of the book, but her heart just wasn't in it (or, perhaps her heart was TOO MUCH in it, and she needed the emotional distance to complete the task). And – this is really my own quirk, no fault of Ms. Smith’s – any reference to the Hotel Chelsea in combination with the 70s and punk makes me think: Nancy Spungen. Ms. Smith remembers it as an idyllic place, but I think of it as a murder scene."

They were in New York in an exciting time for art, music, etc. finding their way to living in the Chelsea hotel, hanging around in places where Andy Warhol people hung out, book shops, art galleries, CBGB.

This claim holds true in Patti Smith’s memoir Just Kids; the story between her and her life-long best friend Robert Mapplethorpe. I was immediately blown away by Smith’s ability to recount every moment like it was only yesterday. Especially seeing how this book served as a type of bildungsroman; a series of moments before you knew they were moments. is so perfectly written, it sounds like fiction. The way it captures the aura of the 1960s-70s in New York City is unparalleled to any other work I’ve read. It is incredibly fascinating how much history Patti Smith has witnessed first hand. From conversations with Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix to hanging out with the Beat poets to having dinners with Andy Warhol, all while these people were still on the rise, it felt like a dream. I also love how Smith marked the passage of time. Nothing ever happened on just a sunday afternoon or on an evening in July, but rather on the night Andy Warhol was shot, the day Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy, or during the . Aligning Robert’s life and declining health with some of the most important dates in pop culture made the that much more immersive and display just how significant and fleeting their youth was."

Nothing seemed more romantic to my young mind. I imagined myself as Frida to Diego, both muse and maker.” Take two driven young artists in a truly remarkable relationship, add a capturing of the spirit of the late 60’s/early 70’s, throw in New York City and Paris and artistic geniuses living and dead, put it all in the hands of an exceptional writer, and what do you get? This masterpiece. I was never a fan of Patti’s music, but I read her small book about writing, , and just knew I would love everything she wrote. But I think this book is very special, and I’ll give three main reasons. First, it’s written to fulfill a sacred promise. Before he died, Patti told her once love and lifetime friend Robert Mapplethorpe she’d write the story of their life together. A deep love and respect comes across on every page. Second, it’s a fascinating story. I think my favorite part was the beginning, where she tells us about each of their childhoods. We get to see how two artists were made--creativity coming to life. For example, when Patti graduated from saying the “Now I lay me down to sleep” prayer, she turned her prayers into which she says led to her She tells a beautiful love story about how she and Robert met and got together. She gives details of their life of struggle, their devotion to art, and the magical time and place where they were becoming themselves. She takes us to the often tiny rooms where they lived and tried to create, and we feel the constraints but also the freedom. And we get to see a new side to Andy Warhol, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Sam Shepard, and so many others. Third, she has taken the messiness of these extraordinary real lives, and turned it into a work of art. The ending of this reads like the best of novels. I cried like I usually only cry over fictional characters, because Patti made them real to me in the way fictional characters are real--that way that makes them feel close and known and whole. I left this in awe, and greatly inspired."

Some years later, I'd put Easter on the stereo myself, and sit on the living room floor, marveling at the cover photo of this skinny androgynous lady with such a powerful, raspy voice, presenting her hairy armpit to the viewer while wearing a silky, translucent blouse that showed her nipples. That's how my love for Patti Smith started. And it was left at that, until, in my teenage years, I discovered her debut album for myself, a glaring hole in my mother's collection. It opened up a whole new world to me; then I saw her live, which just cemented my love for her. And , shortly after I moved out on my own, she released . Our paths are as different as can be, but I can't help but fondly remember my nineteen year old self (the same age Patti was when she set out for New York City on her own), flipping the pages in a small and scantily furnished apartment—nowhere near as bohemian or resplendent as late 60s/early 70s New York City, but the feeling of a new chapter begun, and of a sea of possibilities brimming inside of my heart was the same. This memoir chronicles her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, born from a chance meeting that blossomed into a lifelong friendship and occasional romance. Before they reached critical acclaim and international success in their chosen art fields, they were two scrappy young dreamers, fueled by a shared passion for art more than food, often choosing to go hungry and spend what little money they could scrape together on art supplies instead of a proper meal. Patti sings, speaks, and writes in poems—it's in her DNA. Her worshipful fixation with Arthur Rimbaud (the next time I'll read this, I plan on keeping track of how often his name is mentioned) is reflected in the way she expresses herself, and it would be easy to dismiss her writing as vapid or pretentious... if it weren't so candid and passionately sincere. As far as a pure memoir goes, it might be innocent, naive, or even sugar-coated to a certain extent, and the middle section is often confusing, with a string of meandering mentions of an increasing cast of acquaintances passing through, but the book's magic and impact lie elsewhere; in her snapshots of moments with Robert rendered in minute detail, and her reflections on what it means to devote oneself to art with body and soul. If I'm honest, gives the strong impression that is was Robert that gave her her break--through; not just by being the one to encourage her to sing and create, but by being the more obsessively driven of the pair, willing to sacrifice everything for art; the one who had the vision and confidence in his abilities, and who ultimately managed to break into the Warhol-circle—connections within the art-scene that Patti benefited from as well. Some mentions are only fleeting, but the middle bit does get a little dense with ceaseless name-dropping. The New York art and music scenes at the time were colliding and collectively thriving; Patti and Robert moved with people who broke through and went down in history, and she brings both the grittiness and glamour of this Zeitgeist to life through many anecdotes involving people of the caliber of Jimi Hendrix, Salvador Dalí, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Sam Shepard, and poets of the Beat Generation. starts out as a love letter and ends as an elegy; a deathbed promise to tell their shared story, kept. They'd ultimately go separate ways and find romantic love elsewhere (his acceptance of his sexual orientation causing the first rift), but there is no doubt that they were kindred hearts; true soulmates. I don't think I'd ever feel lonely if there was someone in the world with whom I shared a kinship this profound, and you'll probably fall in love with Robert a little yourself, flaws and all; such is the power of her writing. All of this plays out in front of a stunningly vivid NYC backdrop; her words conjure a time capsule of a perpetually changing city, and paint a poignant portrait of two young artists and their deep commitment to art, and to each other. Her emotionally affecting prose will transport you there, and you'll feel like you're in the foyer of the Chelsea Hotel, scavenging for rare first editions in a bookshop, or eating a Nathan's Famous hotdog at Coney Island... but most of all, you'll have the understanding of what it was like to be a part of that luminous creative scene."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"3.5 What makes this book so moving is Patti's deep love for the brilliant and controversial artist and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and her (evidently) still unassuaged grief for his death from AIDS in 1989. The best parts of the book are the beginning, in which Patti and Robert are penniless lovers who lived together in various places in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and the end, when he dies. They remained genuine friends, in spite of Robert's discovery of his homosexuality and the fact that they broke up and both had many other partners. I wasn't crazy about her poems for Robert, but still Patti's voice and her love and grief for him come through so strongly that I was very moved. The stuff in between---the CBGB years, her affair with Sam Shepherd, her interaction with the Warhol crowd, and her meetings with various famous people like Hendrix and Janis Joplin--were appealing, but less interesting than the connection between Patti and Robert. I think this part of the book could have been shorter. But---as the silly doggerel poem (not written by Patti) goes: ""False friends like autumn leaves are scattered everywhere; True friends like diamonds are precious and rare."" Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe found true friends in each other. And the book is worth reading just for that."
Just Kids,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Superb memoir by an iconic figure. I would rate this highly with Bob Dylan's excellent memoir. Patti Smith focuses on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe in the late 60's and early to mid 70's - just before she made her first album ""Horses."" Again, it is not always the narrative that pulls you through, but the writing itself, and Smith is a fantastic writer. Also life in the Chelsea Hotel really comes to life in her hands. I can smell the front entrance just by her writing of the location, time, and the essence of 7th Ave and West 23rd Street. This is also a beautiful portrait of Manhattan in its last grasp of importance to American culture - which I believe is the re-birth of punk rock and the budding start of hip-hop. I don't think Patti Smith likes to think of herself as a rock n' roll writer for say, but nevertheless she is part of a generation of artists who came from the music world and have merged into literature with no push or pain. Dylan of course comes to mind, but also Richard Hell's novels are fantastic as well. Not only is this a classic rock n' roll memoir of sorts, but it is without the image of rock - and this is a classic piece of work that I think will be seen as a great American memoir."

I saw Patti live in the mid-1990s and was, I'm sad to report, a bit bored. I thought she was destined to be one of those artists who, whilst I have a special affection for her, are no longer relevant. A few weeks ago (Sept 2012) I saw Patti play live at the End Of The Road festival and she was magnificent. Relaxed, passionate, funny, inspiring. That's not all, she's recently released a great new album called 'Banga'. And then there's this book. I bought it for a friend when it was published, and he told me it was good. Seeing Patti live inspired me to finally read it. In short it's a wonderful memoir by an interesting artist. If you have any interest in women in music, Patti Smith, punk, the seventies, then you would almost certainly enjoy it. The majority of the book chronicles Patti's relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. Together they evolve from penniless arrivals to New York city and into a pair of celebrated artists, via the Chelsea hotel, Max's Kansas City, CBGBs and much more. The book is a beautifully written delight. I heartily recommend it. 4/5"

Since I have had great trouble seeing the art in monocolored canvasses, pointless performances of dancing anorexics flinging about with dead animals, poo sculptures and many of the abstract futuristic installations in public space, all supposed to elevate the minds of us unknowing creatures living unimaginative lives, unconscious of our desperate need to break free from our daily rut and look at the world from a different and fresh perspective, the Great Goal of all modern art, well, I thought I seriously needed to read a book about it and see if that could somehow make me see dancing anorexics from a different and fresh perspective. I am still struggling... Some thoughts: 1. I love Duchamp´s urinal as a strong and funny ´in your face´ note to the established art community. Point made. I admire Cézannes serious quest for portraying the world the way we actually see it. Everything after that made with the same or similar goals seems a mimic to me. 2. I understand from the book that the value of a piece of art is to be found in it´s wider e.g. historical context, so that a totally white canvas can be put in a minimalistic tradition and can be traced back to whatever, like Picasso or Monet and we can understand it better and value it more. Context does add meaning to art for me. But it does not validate millions of dollars to be paid for a couple of bricks or whatever they like to call art nowadays. 3. The type of art I find hardest to consider artistic, is sometimes put into context by Gompertz in such a way, as to actually confirm my notion of it being incomprehensible or ripe for the trash. They are made and promoted my megalomanics and psychotics such as Malewitsj, Mondriaan, Breton and Yves Klein. Artists should imo look at everything a bit differently than most of us, but allow us to see it their way at the same time. They can only shift our perspective by connecting to it, by guiding us onto a different path. They, neither the gallery owners and museum directors, cannot expect us to jump right to it. Without guidance, we are lost, missing the point, if there is one. Usually context helps to find this path, Gompertz did in some cases, especially with impressionism, expressionism and dada. In other cases, context made it even more ridiculous, like speculating about the meaning of a canvas with a cut in the middle, or describing the fucked up inner monologue of Mondriaan. 4. I have found my own criterium for art: If it can be considered art outside of a museum or gallery context, it is art. That makes anorexics jumping around with dead animals a bunch of idiots. 5. I have found my own criterium for good art: Good art is art that is worth money or/and interests people because they could not have thought of it and made it themselves. 6. No art is worth more moneywise than a couple of thousand dollars, unless the costs of materials exceed the price. Everything can be used for art and every art should be allowed to be exposed, but a white canvas should never be sold for more money than a Rembrandt. But hey, it was an entertaining read."

Beginning with a short overview of how art as investment increases for both living and dead artists, the author begins with the story of how Marcel Duchamp rocked the art world with his ""Fountain,"" a urinal turned upside down with some drilled holes. The point? What do you see? The artist would say to keep looking and then the layers of meaning may unfold for the viewer - or - perhaps it's just a urinal which elicits a variety of responses from the viewer. Is Gustave Courbet's ""The Origin of the World"" pornography or much more than its surface physicality? These flagrantly different conceptions are comic yet also a window into the world of contemplation and artistic creation that spans 150 years, that which is called ""modern art."" The text then covers multiple schools of art, beginning with pre-Impressionism and Impressionism which is much more than many viewers perceive of as ""just dots"" and really convey the first time artists wanted to paint outdoors, carefully watching how light and shade created beauty in nature's everyday scenes. It also describes how the artists of this period risked so much and even started their own schools to rival the prevailing ""Academy"" system, speaking for the passion of creativity that they felt deserved a larger, appreciative audience. So this story continues with coverage of Cezanne, Primitivism, Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, Neo-Plasticism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Conceptualism, Minimalism, Post-Modernism, and Art Now. Making art three-dimensional on a flat surface, variations of color expressing how one views reality with more vivid colors creating emotional appeal, art with two simple colors that viewed long enough brought the viewer's unconscious into the perception, and so much more. What Are You Looking At?... is a fascinating, intelligently written, very readable look into similarities, differences, and new concepts in the modern artistic world quite frequently seen at the Museum of Modern Art as well as other museums and galleries throughout the world. It's a must read for every person who wants to understand and appreciate great art! Superb and highly recommended!!!"

He takes us on a tour of modern art that is chronologically arranged, but focused on the question of what constitutes “art” and how that idea has unfolded over time. He includes a lot of fascinating gossip and background about the artists of the “modern” period, and very informative vignettes about how they influenced one another. The competitive Picasso, in particular, responded to the achievements of his artist friends first by being mesmerized by them, and then trying to better them. (And succeeding time after time!) The author shows quite clearly how each movement in Modern Art segued into the next, as the artists - often working together - tried to solve problems that arose, such as, for example, representing three-dimensional subjects on a two-dimensional canvas. What he writes of Braque and Picasso during the Cubist period could apply to other groups of artists as well: Even if you just go through the book to note the evolution of how artists defined art, you can get a sense of its general development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The concept of ""what is art"" changed from skill in exact representation, to getting to the ""heart"" of what was being seen, to excelling in design rather than illusory deception, to conveying concepts rather than materiality, to making an immediate and memorable connection with the viewer, to focusing on insight rather than sight, to prompting us to pay more attention to the everyday and the overlooked, to trying to create order out of chaos, to getting us to see that the viewer is as much a part of the work of art as the work itself. And what about art that is totally abstract? Just lines and squiggles and colors? Gompertz maintains: He explains how each generation of modern artists removed more and more traditional details in their paintings so as “to capture atmospheric light (Impressionism), accentuate the emotive qualities of color (Fauvism), or look at the subject from multiple viewpoints (Cubism).” Eventually, of course, the details were removed altogether. Artists came to see themselves as not in the business of “reproduction” at all, but rather of exploring new ways to represent truth “that might provoke previously untapped thoughts and feelings in the viewer.” My favorite chapter (that is, the one from which I learned the most) is the one dealing with Pop Art. My reactions themselves could have been transformed into a pop art canvas: “Wow!” And “I never thought of that!” And “How devilishly clever!” A recurring theme in the book is how advances in the other arts (especially music), the sciences, and even politics echo, reinforce, and reverberate with, changes in art. Sometimes abstract art is meant to be like music; sometimes it is meant to be like the mind; and sometimes, it is meant to suggest sociological commentary and/or change. And similarly, giants in the fields of music, psychology, science, and politics have been stimulated in their thinking by ideas they gleaned from artistic trailblazers. Laudably, Gompertz also lets us in on a rather disappointing fact about modern art. He writes: He includes a section on the marginalization of women artists such as the great Freda Kahlo, while noting that this situation continues even today, in an art world still largely dominated by white men. Gompertz begins and ends the book with musings about Marcel Duchamp, the artist whom most contemporary artists cite as an influence, and whose seminal work “Fountain” is, according to the author, “the single most influential artwork created in the twentieth century.” The author concludes that whereas Picasso may have been the dominant force in the first half of the 20th century, “there is no question that the second half has increasingly been played out against a backdrop of Duchampian mind games.” The subtitle of the book is “The Surprising, Shocking, and Sometimes Strange Story of 150 Years of Modern Art,” and this is so apt. I must have said “who knew?!!!” at least twenty times while reading this. (Moreover, Jim’s occasional challenge of details in the book sent me off to google many times as well, finding not only that in every case that the author was indeed correct, but also thereby exposing me to even more fascinating bits about the item in question.) (FYI, the biggest question was about the feasibility of the production of 100 million porcelain individually hand-painted sunflower “seeds” by Chinese artist Wei-Wei and 1600 assistants, a brilliant exhibit as explained by Gompertz, but also one requiring that each artisan had to have produced 62,500 seeds. How did they do it and how long did it take? Read an interview with the artist, .) Gompertz is excited and passionate about his subject. He wants us to love and appreciate art, and his enthusiasm is infectious. His prose is animated and entertaining. (In fact, this book was an outgrowth of the author's standup comedy show in the UK about modern art.) There are a gazillion fascinating and eye-opening (both literally and metaphorically) concepts presented. Since most of them have to do with visual communication, however, the book clearly would have benefited from more illustrations. Even the few full color plates included are helpful that it’s a sin there aren’t more! It is not a book once can (or should!) scan or race through. Rather, I think it should be sampled and savored and contemplated, bit by bit. I could see it as a text [non-traditional in the sense that it is not academic in tone at all] for a delightful evening class on art that meets once a week, and during which we see many slides while discussing the salient points of each chapter. (And then we break for wine and cheese and fruit, artfully arranged on a tilting table….) 4/5 (I would have rated it higher had there been more illustrations, although in truth, there would have had to have been so many, it would have trebled the size and cost of the book. Maybe it would make a better online book, with hypertext links….?) Highly recommended!"

Entirely unpretentious in tone and form; I learned very much from this easy reading book. On the back cover it says that Gompertz is the world's first self proclaimed ""art-history stand-up comedian"". After reading that I thought that maybe this book would be too digressive, structurally disjointed, and perhaps even unlearned: which all seemed unappealing to me at the time, since I was looking to find a more comprehensive survey. My fears were extinguished nearly from the start. Sure, Gompertz does use a casually jokey and light hearted approach in his writing, but it's not overdone, and he has a real knack for explaining concepts in a way that is extremely easy to understand. He readily acknowledges the fact that this is not an academic work of history and admits he could pull no such thing off. Even so, his approach to artists, movements, and certain unique incidents is always concisely presented and informative. He separates the movements chronologically by chapter, and his chapter progressions are tied in nicely with each other. For a book who's task is to talk about paintings it's obviously important to have pictures of the stuff your discussing included. Gompertz for the most part does this well. He includes 29 colour plates separated into its own corner of the book, these are the most important images he wishes to show. Other than this he occasionally sprinkles black and white figures throughout the pages if they're necessary to see or if their just too hard to describe verbally (and he does this quite a bit), for the rest of the time you're probably gonna have to hop back-and-forth between his descriptions and Google to get the full picture. Overall, a very enjoyable and informatively constructed introduction to Modern art (and even a little Contemporary) if you're in the market for such a book. If it didn't have as many jokes within I could see this being used a college textbook."

That goes for this book and for art movements of the last 100 years. I found it interesting his explanation of how Degas differed from the other impressionists. He did not work rapidly, he preferred the studio to plein air, and while the others were focused on ever-changing light, his focus was on the illusion of movement. He also was an outstanding draftsman, which the others were not. I knew that about this time, art dealers began to become more important making the all-important salon less so for the sale of art works, but Gompertz explains this in more detail. Paul Durand-Ruel was key to the continued work of the impressionists and instrumental to the evolving role of art dealers and galleries. I read a lot about art history and artists, but I've never seen such a short and clear explanation of this change in the business of art. Gompertz gives a short biography of Vincent van Gogh and then tells about his work. I thought it unfortunate that within that very brief bio, he insisted on the myth that Vincent shot himself when Steven Naifeh and Gregory White's biography of Vincent made a very convincing argument for the fact that he was shot by someone else and that biography was published a year before this book. A good discussion of Cezanne where he makes clear how important he was and how much other artists valued him. I was disappointed to see that Gompertz left out Catalan (Spanish) art nouveau. He mentions France (Art Nouveau), Germany (Jugendstil), Austria (Vienna Secessionist). And Spain? Catalonia had an active decorative art movement called Modernism. There were painters, and more famously, there was the architect Antoni Gaudi whose Sagrada Familia and Parc Guell most people have heard of, even if Gompertz hasn't. I appreciated the observation about Matisse, ""...his ability to make a simple mark on canvas that makes an immediate and memorable connection with the viewer elevates him from the good painter to the great artist. The balancing effect of his contrasting shapes, and the coherence of his compositions have been matched by very few artists in the history of painting."" I won’t go into all the contemporary artists (of the last 50 or so years). Just Tracey Emin. Among other of her works, Gompertz talks about My Bed (pg. 382) and describes it as ""just that: Tracey Emin's bed, unmade, and dishevelled with stained sheets. It was surrounded on the floor by the detritus of her life: empty bottles of booze, cigarette-ends and dirty underwear."" He goes on to say that ""Tracey Emin's unmade bed 'made' her. She became notorious, a love-to-hate character for the media, which she manipulated expertly, becoming very rich and very famous along the way."" Thankfully, I never heard of her until now. On the back cover of my copy it says, in glowing affirmation of this book, that it ""explains why Tracey Emin's unmade bed is a work of art, and why yours is not."" I beg to differ. Mine is better because (1) I make my bed each morning, and (2) my dirty underwear is hidden away. In a very poor argument, Gompertz says that ""a lot of people knock Tracey Emin, say she is a fraud. History will judge the quality of her art, but she is not a fraud. She has a first class degree from Maidstone College of Art and an MA from the Royal College of Art. Her work can be found in the collections of the world's most illustrious modern art museums (MoMA, Pompidou, Tate); etc. Well, la dee dah. How sad to resort to making your point by begging the question. The Impressionists had to hold their own exhibition because the establishment didn't like their work. Vincent van Gogh only managed to sell one painting in his lifetime. The art establishment can be wrong either way. The argument for Emin, with her art degrees and acceptance by the Tate doesn't prove a thing. What Gompertz has convinced me of is that art has become a commodity and the art establishment the center of a big business."

And, trust me, even that is an overstatement. Being educated since birth in the sciences as an Indian kid you often lose touch with that side of yours which could possibly be beyond equations. And the slowly murdering bitch that time is, I just let go a desire to even appreciate or bother myself with the question 'Is this art?'. After moving to Amsterdam, my inquisitiveness about art remained superficial despite having all of Europe's art at disposal to look at, contemplate, tilt head - left and right, think, diss/admire. But recently I went on a weekend trip with one of my friends who has had her education in the arts and has a passion for it. After a few discussions, I believe she realised that I want to learn about art, but I just didn't know where to start. As a result, she recommended me this book. And boy did she nail it. This book is like the art parallel of 'A short history of nearly everything' or 'Sapiens'. It's the 'summary about art' book we both deserve and need. But the reasons why I liked it were pretty personal....... as art is (whaaaaaaaaa). - It's actually funny. Art for me often used to conjure up images of men and women dressed in eye blinding white with wine glasses in all of their 13 hands whispering things to each other in a low voice as if they were cautious about spilling out the secrets of the greatest orgasm to basal folks like me. But this book took a new angle and tried to make the origin story available for the 'proletariat'. - It's chronologically sensible. This book starts with Marcel Duchamp and ends with Banksy. There is a timeline of reasoning that the author derives while meandering through the whole lot of Impressionism, Cubism, Minimalism, Post-modernism and the historical innovations hitching them together. - IT'S SENSIBLE. This perhaps is the biggest win of this book for me. It dejargonized art for me. The author literally combined history with art and made it fun for me. For this feat alone, a special place in heaven should be designed for the writer - that land slot beside the one Bill Bryson shall move into. For anyone who has deeply pondered over questions like 'Dafuq is that? Why is it art? What is art? Am I art? Is a tart art?', reading this book will involve a lot of 'Oh! That's why!' moments. So enjoy :)"

Because the way art works today is influenced by the first ever artistic revolution. What Are You Looking At? is mostly a history of painting because it's the first art form to ever be institutionalized and taught in academies, which is an important aspect of the book. There was a certain way artists were taught to paint because at one time in history, painting was a technical skill. When you didn't have cameras to take photos, you needed a specialized worker to capture your essence in visual form. Not everyone could do it. But like everything stuck in academia, it went on for way too long and at some point, young artists called them out on it. The impressionists lived in the era of early photographs and didn't want to offer just an equivalent. They wanted to paint what they perceived and not necessarily what was just there. They would blaze the path for everyone. Will Gompertz traces the legacy from impressionists to performance art, but it really is broader than that. It applies to every art form. Take pop music for exemple. Boys bands from the 90s were a corporate response to the monsters of the eighties (Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, etc.) The industry thought they could systematize the success and they kind of did. But the kids reappropriated themselves the music and pop became indie again. Billie Eilish, Lorde, Harry Styles, etc. Transformations were caused by social and technological changes, which lead to different art forms. That is what the lessons from Will Gompertz are. Modern artists were just like our celebrities before our time."

I have the stories to go along with it - riding a Rothko down on top of a billionaire's freight elevator, meticulously drawing sketches of 76 Tracey Emin polaroids to show if they have any scratches, taking the glass off a couple of Francis Bacon paintings, I could go on. I'm the person that will try to convince a friend that Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is in fact genius, but is also a joke. Even with all that experience, Will Gompertz's survey of art history from the mid 19th century until (almost) today was full of interesting facts, connections among movements, and a bit of humor. This is the kind of book that is really aimed at those skeptical of modern art, but willing to put in a little work to try to understand it, even if they don't like it. He does an excellent job of it. I already have one friend I'd love to give it to. My biggest BIGGEST criticism is the almost nearly entire exclusion of women. He even makes a comment about the erasure of women from art history, with a few outliers, but is just as guilty of that exclusion himself. While he talks about the boys clubs of Abstract Expressionism, early American Modernism, Minimalism, etc, there were no mentions of Grace Hartigan, Sonia Delaunay, Eliane DeKooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Lee Krasner, Agnes Martin, Joan Mitchell, or even Georgia O'Keeffe. Why talk about the exclusion of women, without an attempt to help correct that? It irked me. I am really excited to take my young niece to MOMA for the first time next week, and this book was an excellent refresher of the interesting interconnected stories that make up modern art history."

I have spent the last few years trying to self-educate on art and art history, secreted away in art-gallery bookstores poring over coffee table books, artists' biographies and compendiums on modern and contemporary art. I've been three valiant attempts at Gombrich's momentous work, The Story of Art, but Gompertz' book has been my breakthrough. He commands an extraordinary scope and breadth of knowledge beginning with the Impressionists and ending c. 2008 (with a movement he bravely terms, ""entrepreneurialism""). All of this, mercifully, is transmitted without academic waffle but rather with clarity, humour and charm. Some of his discussions leave the reader feeling a little unsatisfied (Mondrian's neo-plasticity is just as incomprehensible to me as it was before he explained it) and a few of his other chapters are a little anti-climactic (the truncated section on the Futurists stands out here). However, this just opens up avenues for further exploration for the reader, equipped with a solid introduction and reference points. With the reasonable exception of Gauguin, Gompertz jumps to the defence of almost every artist and movement in the book. He should be applauded for this. Especially in the later chapters where the movements become increasingly abstract and the lay-reader's incredulity begins to rise he defuses this with aplomb. Overall, Gompertz' book is an excellent and absorbing discussion of the fantastic and fascinating world of modern and contemporary art."

I really liked the parts on how this or that movement in art further influenced advertisement, industrial and home design, and more broadly our perception of a visually appealing thing. First half of the book (roughly until WWII) is somehow better organized, to my taste. The closer the book got to the 2000s, the more questions arose in my mind about the relevance/value of this or that piece of art/artist. I was left with an impression that the author struggled more with explaining art which came after postmodernism. He partly does acknowledge this himself explicitly in his attempt to find a suitable name for the art movement(s) since the 1990s."

Having no prior knowledge on Modern art, I have always been so confused by it; why is a urinal considered art? Why are these grids art? What is Warhol's deal? Writer Will Gompertz breaks down modern art wonderfully, starting with Impressionism and its early rebellious stage, and with each chapter, he teaches us about how each art period influences the other, how fauvism leads to cubism, and later rejection of seriousness in dadaism. Gompertz writes in a colloquial, and often humorous manner; he cites his attempts at stand-up comedy as inspiration, and it shows. While there are sometimes some cringey aspects, such as his reliance on recreating a ""day in the life of"" of some famous artists, Gompertz delivers in succinctly explaining the many periods of modern art. I walked away with a greater understanding and appreciation of modern art, and dare I say, I am even looking forward to visiting one now. I recommend this book for anyone who wants an entry-level means to understanding modern art."

Going through the book is like a rollercoaster faster and crazier the closer it it coming to the present time. I didn't love the style of writing because of a lot of unnecessarily obscure vocabulary and references. Still, it is somewhat falling short of explaining clearly a lot of pieces in their intentions, background and execution choices... Which I should not complain because it is already a pretty long and complicated book; as for the decipher of a lot of art work in this book - reviewing and commenting on art is a wildly subjective behavior, it's totally normal that I have a lot of different opinions regarding some of the perspectives the writer takes on some art pieces. That being said, it's still a very helpful book, I can see myself coming back to it a few times after finishing...but I would also need to keep looking into more accurate and systematic descriptions of art history to build on this one."

I read this book with the intent of gaining some basic familiarity with the major players and movements of art in the last century, and it certainly succeeded in that respect. I can now trace the line of artistic innovations that led from the Cubism of Picasso and Braque to the Minimalism of Judd and Andre, and am no longer completely perplexed by Damien Hirst's pickled animals (see his work above) or Takashi Murakami's statues of disconcertingly pornographic cartoon characters (actually, I'm still pretty weirded out by them.) Unfortunately, a bare-bones summary of modern art is all that provides. Gompertz is mildly amusing and to be fair to him, does try to prevent his book from becoming too dull, occasionally incorporating interesting anecdotes from his career working at the Tate. But overall, the book comes across as a slightly hapless attempt by a man without experience writing about art history to try and convince hoi polloi that no, their five year old really couldn't do that (this is a point that recurs several times throughout the book.) But despite the book's faults, it does do a very good job of making an extremely abstract (pun intended) subject accessible, which is an achievement in itself. In the end though, you can do a lot worse when looking for an introduction to modern art. But I'm decently sure you can do a lot better too. 2/5 stars"

What Are You Looking At?: 150 Years of Modern Art in a Nutshell is a perfect mix of both. 435 pages of insights, historical context, and interesting discussions. The book starts with a deconstruction and context of the iconic Marcel Duchamp's readymade sculpture , which immediately caught my attention, and then goes through each significant modern art movement. From Pre-Impressionism to Postmodernism and the art after that. Overall, the book provides an excellent explanation of modern art and the main ideas behind each movement. Also gives a quick intro to the significant works of art and the artists behind them. I also got introduced to some new artists like Robert Rauschenberg and his , as well as the works of Sarah Lucas and Tracy Emin. Super cool. I recommend this book to everyone who loves art and who's interested in diving deeper into the ideas and concepts behind art. All in all, a very entertaining and easily readable book. I'm adding it to my 'Favorites' and will get back to it before my next visit to MoMA."

The best thing about it is that it lets readers appreciate art works based on the originality and ingenuity of the works in reaction to 'what came before'. A metro-like map is added to see how different art forms are influenced and how they flow into the next. This is essential and rewarding, in that - for me - it spills over to other cultural forms and beyond. For example, in 2018, many people find it difficult to appreciate movies, literature, or music from X years ago. The kind of argument that goes: if you've seen Avengers, why would you like Star Wars? This book shows that 'works of art' (in the broad definition) cannot and should not be judged on quality only, but also on ideas, on originality, on how disruptive the artist has broken with his own influences - or how much he/she has borrowed from others. Straight onto my recommendation list."

Few paintings move me to tears, though I do enjoy them. And I've never really understood modern art. I don't know if Gompertz' book has changed either of those facts. But it has given me a new appreciation for modern art. I may never see the fuss in Pollack's paintings as stand-alone objects. But I understand their importance to art history and the development of art. And that brought me a new appreciation for them. Gompertz' writing style is approachable, fun, and easy to parse. He doesn't get high-handed and he even pokes fun at a subject matter that is often treated as too serious to mock. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator's voice is wonderfully nuanced while his pacing is slightly slower than conversational. Which is great for people who like to just sit back and sink into an audiobook. I sped the recording up to 1.25 speed and felt like I was talking to a friend who just happened to be an expert on modern art. The narrator is just that good."

To say it bluntly, this book deserved a far better reader than me. I’m a visual person who very much feeds off plot and character and with this being a non-fiction book, my brain just refused to absorb, visualise and process it. And that’s not the fault of the author at all because it’s truly great, I’m just not a girl who does well with non-fiction. The author did a great job and it’s a book I would truly recommend to anyone looking to educate themselves on modern art a little but I really struggled to get through this as a solid Fiction Bitch. The fact that my boyfriend let me borrow this on our second date (to an art gallery 🥺) in September and I’m only just finishing it now speaks for how much I just don’t have the right brain for non-fiction.

Structured as encyclopedic entries on the various isms of modern art, it presents art as a dialogue between generations and groups of artists who sought to add something new, in their own unique voice, to the conversation. I found the chapters on post-impressionists, Cubism and Dadaism particularly fascinating as they very effectively convey a sense of the enormous influence that Van Gogh, Cezanne, Picasso and Duchamp had on subsequent artists. The journey from abandonment of perspective to total abstraction is presented as very logical in the context of history and almost bound to happen. Very, very interesting. Perhaps inevitably the book came across as somewhat uneven in places: there is an entire chapter on Cezanne with a detailed account of his influence on the Cubists and Suprematists, but in comparison much less is said of the significance of Pollock and Rothko. I am not sure if that was intended as implicit commentary on the relative standing of these artists, but I was eager to find out more about many names which were only briefly mentioned. Which, I suppose, is a reflection that the book succeeds in its main goal."

It affects, inspired, and disgusts equally and differently for everyone involved. But until the mid-1800's there were some generally accepted rules that artists followed - but since then that idea has been shot down utterly and completely by modern and contemporary art but not before completely offending and confusing the entire world. This book is an attempt to explain modern art to anyone and everyone. It's not meant to be academic but approachable. And it has some fabulous passages that do just that. It educates and yet surprises. It turns modern assumptions about modern art on their heads while explaining why we made these assumptions in the first place. One of my favorite passages from the book that does just that is the following which discusses Impressionism... Another fantastic part of this book is the connections reveals between different art styles as a result of modern and contemporary artists being influenced and inspired by those who have come before them. This book is also helping me to understand why I have liked these works all along anyways! For instance I have always enjoyed Edgar Degas's ballerina paintings and bronze sculptures as I danced for a large portion of my life. Whenever I would see one of these works or even a poster of a painting I would always be drawn to its edges, and basically try to peak under the frame or edges for the rest of the scene. I was desperate to know what was being hidden from me. What I was missing out on. You see Degas would severely crop his work taking the action all the way to the edge of the canvas and beyond even cutting dancers in half and hiding more outside the realm of the canvas. Turns out he was inspired to do this by Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints who exercised the same method. I had no idea this connection existed between Impressionism and Japanese woodblocks and love that art can be so universal."

I literally fell in love with it from the 1st pages. It combines both the historical facts from the biographies of different artists in a storytelling form, also the author provides historical context (what's highly important as it directly influenced the direction where the art was going) and describes some of the works of those artists giving deep explanation connected both to the style and personality of the artists as well as to historical events which could have inspired these pieces of art. The book is not just broken into parts telling about these and that artists or movements it's told as a complex story so the reader gets to understand which famous artists worked and lived at the same time, how they cooperated or rivaled, who influenced each other and so on. As well, the book allows us to understand how art evolved and why it changed that way, how one movement transformed into another, and so on. I think it should be a must-read for people who don't understand contemporary art and call it silly or too weird. I always was a fan of contemporary art but now I can easily distinguish whether the artwork belongs to impressionism, expressionism, cubism, or other movements. I wish there were more books like that not just about art!"

I have it on Audible and within a very short time, also bought it in paperback (to flick through) and for Kindle (for the links and notes facility). Gompertz, who I knew only as a film and theatre critic (who was not inclined to be pompous or obfuscating about it), writes with a refreshing lack of reverence for the art history schtick that so turns me off; and while he claims not to be entirely accurate (because he's expressing opinions just like everyone else) his humorous gallop through the basics of modern art is just what I needed. Suddenly, names mean more to me, the reasons behind the almost limitless movements make sense to me (at least insofar as they make actual sense at all), and the politics and machinations of the (overwhelmingly) male makers of the art makes sense to me. With Gompertz to hand, I can tackle some of the less welcoming tomes because I have a touchstone. Of all the art books I've bought, this (and Henry Moore's sheep sketchbook with no writing in it at all) is my absolute art undergrad life-saving favourite. Did I say it was a good read? It's a good read, a very good read. Update: I've read and re-read this book, or listened actually letting the information seep in while I do practical things, and it's beginning to stick. I recognise names and references, associations and movements. It's become an invaluable staple."

Obviously one could go more in depth on any one of these chapters, but Gompertz does an excellent job of hitting the highlights and has an engaging style that manages to neatly avoid being boring--a sadly common problem of many art history books. More illustrations--particularly more full-color ones--would have been nice, but those likely would have made the book prohibitively expensive. One complaint I do have regarding the illustrations is the image quality of some of the B&W ones. There are several cartoons making humorous points scattered throughout the text, and the reproduction on them (as well as some of the B&W photos) is terrible with visible pixilation. They look like third generation faxes. It's the sort of image quality one would expect from a pre-publication copy, but not from a finished text. If this really was the best quality that could be obtained, some disclaimer to that effect would have been nice. That said, the book is still excellent and it certainly wouldn't be much of an effort to use the internet to track down some clearer photos if one really wished to. Highly recommended."

Knowledge rarely impacts one's tastes! However, this very-readable book did an outstanding job of telling the story of modern art: why it started, how it progressed, and how we ended up where we are today. The author did introduce some fictionalized conversations, but he was right up-front about that: the people were where he placed them, when he placed them there, in the company in which they appear...but the words and actions may be somewhat imaginary. Most of these seemed to occur in the first part of the book. It got a bit tricky trying to keep all the names sorted out, and as the book progressed I was a little overwhelmed with names and dates. In addition, I found it very helpful to have my computer or smart phone in hand to look up images of the referenced works that didn't appear printed in the book.

I'll just say that it's brilliantly written and sometimes even hear touching stories and colorful anecdotes about specific paintings and artists. Will Gompertz took the impossible mission of covering so much of modern art history and he did it impressively well. this book is an absolute must.

That did not happen. Instead, this book is an introduction of all the -isms that made up the 150 years of modern art, plus the brief period afterwards we call postmodernism and also where are we heading to from there. I'm not complaining because I think this books does a good job explaining the transition of each movement and what the artists of each movement try to achieve by doing what they did. Prior to this, when I heard about modern art I immediately thought of Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup cans and those weird sculptures made from basically trash. That was about it. I did not even know that Van Gogh was also part of modern art, in his own post-Impressionist movement that people later dubbed as Expressionism. That I am enlightened about Gauguin, Pollock, and Rothko after reading this book means that the author has achieved something, in me. But whether or not this has increased my appreciation of the modern art, or rather of certain subsets of modern art, remains doubtful. I still cannot understand abstract art and no matter how accessible the language used by Will Gompertz, a piece of black canvas will always remain just that to me. No amount of staring at a Pollock's drip painting will elucidate me as to how significant his works are in the movement that is modern art. I find it ironic that despite a number of artists in the past attempting to make art accessible to the general public, as modern art progressed, art became even more obdurate and opaque. At least when you look at old masters' paintings and even an Impressionist painting, you can see what the subjects are, without having any prior knowledge about art history. But what are you, a regular person with no degree in art, is supposed to know when confronted with a piece of canvas showing a number of boxes and circles? Or a painting with lines and curves which, if not for the title 'Apple Tree', you would not have guessed was showing the picture of a tree? That you need to know something about a certain movement before you can make sense of what a painting or sculpture is about only serves to remove Art, with capital A, from the hoi polloi. Still, Gompertz did a good job introducing and rationalising each movement, I did not feel like I was being talked down from a pedestal (and that is important because who likes a know-it-all), and if anyone ever needed a crash course on modern art, this is the book I can recommend hands down. That his explanations sometimes just garnered a smirk on my cynical face was all due to my lack of understanding and appreciation rather than any fault on his part. As the saying goes, there is no accounting for good taste and I just don't have the cultivated taste for appreciating modern art. But I'm fine with that because I would rather be scruffy little me than any billionaire with too much money who had ran out of idea on how to spend it so instead they bought a banana with duct tape, because it was Art."

It's another Art History book. Maybe more engaging than some, if you have the same sense of humor as the author. But it still 1. focuses on individual artists and, even more tightly, on individual works 2. does not have nearly enough illustrations or even concrete descriptions to help us actually *see* the works, and 3. has an awful lot of speculation and personal interpretation, not enough grounded objectivity. (re #2 - I have been lucky enough to see Van Gogh's ""Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun"" and let me tell you, never mind a b&w photo in an art history book, or even a coffee-table book - the real thing blows me away like nothing else.) Gompertz's creation would make a good app on the tablet. An image of each work should be linked directly to the text, Each work should be reproduced in a manner that shows the reader the brilliance (or lack thereof) the color, should be zoomable to show texture, and should have a standard figure of reference to show size. Each work should also be linked to related works, vocabulary, and the timeline. I'm frustrated because I still can't see, in each work, that which Gompertz and other popularizers & experts say I should be able to. The pointillist ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte – 1884"" by Georges Seurat is supposedly not a moment captured in time, but a surreal frozen tableau. I understand Gompertz' reasoning: Seurat took a lot of time and care precisely creating this scene, and yet there's no way that the models would be anywhere near so still and chill for anywhere near that long.... but Gompertz connects this to David Lynch. Huh? And Gaugin's ""Why are you so Angry?"" still makes no sense to me, even after Gompertz tells us the story of the brothel on the island paradise. Does anyone see anger here? Does any member of the general public even see a brothel, or anger? How does a viewer like me have a chance of appreciating art *without* knowing the story behind each piece? (And it isn't just modern art. Traditional art is full of religious allegory, symbolic iconography, classical allusions... It's frustrating. I read and study with an open mind, and have for years, and I took art history classes in college, and I'm not stupid... and I still feel excluded, or at least as if there's a code I can't break. Is most art created for other artists, for art experts, and for the status seeking wealthy patrons?) I'm still looking for an art book that will help me actually figure out what I'm looking at without someone like Gompertz holding my hand through each and every piece. Art appreciation hasn't addressed this question, nor has art history, nor have books aimed at children (though they are generally the most helpful) ... do *you* have a recommendation?"

One of my great regrets (among many!) is not having taken full advantage of my alma mater William College’s excellent Art History department & Museum of Art. The folly of youth, I suppose. Later in life, I developed a love for art, going to art museums in every city/town I may be as well as dedicated fairs such as Art Basel (unfortunately Vienna Biennale not yet, it’s on my bucket list). Having said that, I am far more of an admirer of art & less of a collector. Preferring modern art over the Grandmasters (ancient Greek, Roman, Italian Renaissance, etc.), I also developed some ad hoc knowledge of the various artists, their signature work etc over the years, but had never really put it together. In this book, art journalist/critic & former director of London’s Tate Gallery, Will Gompertz describes the groundbreaking movements, influential artists, and the seismic moments that have shaped the trajectory of modern art. The timeline, how the major movements are related as well as their historical & social contexts, why certain pieces of artwork are considered seminal, & how the artists themselves interacted with each other are all described not with pompous intellectualism, but chatty commentary. The chronologically ordered separate chapters are dedicated to Impressionism (e.g. Monet, Degas, Manet, Renoir), Post-Impressionism (Van Gogh, Gaugin, Seurat, Cezanne), Primitivism/Fauvism (Matisse, Modigliani, Giacometti), Cubism (Picasso, Braque), Futurism (Boccioni, Jacob Epstein), Abstract Art (Kandinsky, Klee), Suprematism/Constructivism (Malevich, Tatlin), Neo-Plasticism (Mondrian), Bauhaus school of Germany, Dadaism (Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp), Surrealism (Miro, Ernst, Dali, Frida Kahlo), Abstract Expressionism (Pollack, William de Kooning, Rothko), Pop Art (Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg, Warhol, Lichtenstein), Conceptualism/Performance Art (Yves Klein, Fontana, Joseph Beuys, Francis Alys), Minimalism (Donald Judd, Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt), Post-Modernism (Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger), and finally the art of today, where there is no unifying movement, including the artist-entrepreneurs (Hirst, Murakami, Koons) and street art (Shepard Fairey, Banksy). While the book does include some pics, I found it helpful to simultaneously look up the artists & artwork on the internet (try Wikiart.com) while reading. After all, art begins with visual stimulus. Having read this book, I appreciate the artwork far more, and can’t wait to go to the world’s leading museums again. Enlightening, witty, easy to read. Most highly recommended."

And it does a splendid job explaining expressionism, pointillism, Duchamp, surrealism, and so on. However! I had already been a fan of all of these art movements, and it's not hard to see for example what Duchamp was doing with his urinal. What Gompertz doesn't succeed in doing is to explain the really modern art to me in a way that is persuasive. OK, Tracey Emin is smart, she has humour, and knows how the art establishment and the gossip press work. So, does that make her art good? My bed, which is basically just Tracey Emin's bed placed in an art museum, managed to outrage people. Fine. Jackass can also cause outrages. But is it really art because she says it is? Look, I'm not opposing that her bed can be art, but I'm questioning it because Gompertz didn't really give a good answer to the question. Why would a bed looking the same that you walk by in a hotel not be art? There, you would just think ""oh fuck, a dirty, unmade bed, lets move on"". You wouldn't react like this if you saw the Venus de Milo suddenly at a hotel - you would stop, stare, and be amazed. But is it art because it causes a certain reaction in the viewers who have to frame her bed into what they know of what should or shouldn't belong in an art museum? Perhaps, or isn't that just a prank? What if Jackass did the same, i.e. exhibited some of their stuff in an art gallery or museum? Is that art? I don't know, and I'm not much the wiser after having read Gompertz' book. In my opinion, the biggest challenge for artists today is to deal with beauty. Beauty is somehow passé, it's old, it's boring. But that's what makes beauty into such a difficult yet challenging subject today! It's easy to annoy the British press, but it's harder to make something that is both beautiful enough to please and amaze the museum goers, and interesting enough to be considered art and not just random illustration or photography. Challenging, interesting beauty, is there such a thing? Yes, but it's very rare in our society. It's easier to keep a distance to your work, be ironic (since irony works as a shield against any criticism). I find modern art often too safe in its irony, gore, and ugliness. I want something new that we can build on, that can rise up from the dust heaps of post-modernism. Entertaining book, up until minimalism and pop art, where the explanations started to become less and less compelling. I give it four stars for its entertainment value!"

All art derives significance and aesthetic value from its social, cultural and historical context. But this is especially true of modern art, as it moves farther and farther away from the allegorical and representational objectives of its more literal forebears. This can make modern art seem impenetrable, even vaguely fraudulent, to the contemporary layperson who looks at Cy Twombly's blackboard scribbles and thinks that their 5-year old could do it (to be fair, I think this actually holds true for Cy Twombly). Will Gompertz is here to tell you that the story of modern art is an interesting one, and if he can give you a broad overview of the broad themes guiding the evolution of modern art, you will be able to understand how modern art got to the point it is and appreciate the intentions of some of its more recondite practitioners. And it starts off really well and interestingly. The first on the scene were the French Impressionists, epitomised by Monet and friends, whose sketchy, light-focused paintings of the ordinary (as opposed to the mythic-historical or religious) represented a genteel rebellion against the oppressive aesthetic restrictions of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Impressionism led to post-Impressionism, represented by Van Gogh and Cezanne and their attempts capture the feeling of a place, rather than its faithful representation, through the liberal experimentation with color and perspective. Cosmopolitanism and a hint of orientalist exoticism crept into the scene with the advent of Primitivism and Fauvism, in which artists like Paul Gauguin borrowed or stole from exotic cultures to fuel their art; but this synthesis only spurred modern art into new directions. Cubism, led by Picasso, drew from the studies of perspective undertaken by Cezanne and represented a significant break from representational art, in its attempts to introduce new ways that painting could represent the ways in which people perceived the world in its full, multi-faceted dimensionality. It was around this time - the 1930s, that politics intruded into art, with movements such as Futurism arising that took shape from ideologies of strength, action and supremacy, that cast in another light could almost be taken for Fascism. And indeed, many of its proponents, like Marinetti, were dyed-in-the-wool Fascists. If Futurism represented an attempt to break from the strictures of the past, then it also ushered in an era where artists started to realise that art need not be representational at all; it need not depict the real world, but instead could celebrate the media with which it was created on its own terms. Movements like Orphism and Kandinsky's Blue Rider group were the vanguard of this new form of abstract art, which favored the materiality of the piece and the feelings it instilled in the viewer, rather than what it purported to depict or represent (which, often, was nothing). In this regard, art was supposed to mimic music in how it could evince emotion through the pure painting, much like music could elicit frisson through the arrangement of notes in a pure, abstracted melody. Later still, many started to see art as a tool for achieving social objectives, or to mobilise people towards some end. This was the time of Constructivism, pioneered by the Soviet artist Vladimir Tatlin of fame, of art that sought to influence peoples and start movements. But this was not limited to Communist agitprop, but percolated over to capitalism as well - Bauhaus and similar movements which sought to introduce into production, to use technology to mass produce beautiful yet functional products for the betterment of consumers. After the ruination visited upon the world by the First World War, it was understandable also that many movements started out of rage and a desire to mock and destroy the very structures that had allowed such devastation to occur in the first place. These included Dadaism (exemplified by folks like Duchamp and his irreverent passing off of a urinal as high art), and initially, Surrealism. But Surrealism became something more - a way for artists to tap on the unconscious, dreams, and alternate mental states to generate their art. And from that, we get masterpieces like Dali's and a great deal of Rene Magritte's weird but wonderful paintings. The development of techniques to tap on the unconscious to paint was brought to a head by the Abstract Expressionists, whose art had lost all semblance of representational intent and instead used techniques like action painting to translate the unconscious impulse onto the canvas, to make the viewer feel the emotions that the artist felt when painting it, to overwhelm the sensoria with creations that seem to bleed from the canvas into reality. Pop Art, in contrast, was the total opposite - the impulse, in an age of renewed consumerism, to reflect that state of affairs in art, through mass production (or the facsimile thereof, cf Roy Liechtenstein's hand-painted matrix dots), found objects, and the feeling of crass advertising, sexual desire, and self-promotion common in such works. Finally, in the past decades, art has taken all these developments and produced contemporary movements like minimalism - which take the abstraction of traditional media and sculpture to logical extremes to produce simple, elegant forms that are meant only to evoke pure feeling in the observer; Fluxus and conceptual art, in which the boundaries of what constitutes art are pushed to the limits, with emphasis of the process of art over any actual piece - indeed, performance art is all about the process and often the product, captured on tape, is only a shadow of the actual experience, more so than usual. And finally, the world of today, where Art is more popular and accessible than ever before, but also commoditized by the rich and gawked at by the masses, having reached a point where so much is required to even begin understanding it that most people throw up their hands in futility. Gompertz gives it a valiant go, and is mostly successful at really trying to create a compelling historical narrative of how we got to where we are today. But, in a sense, he still speaks from a position of the insider, trying to get people to understand what the big deal is. He's the art world's great proponent, but his enthusiasm for the art that he describes sometimes feels misplaced - as if he's reading too much into the art, or perhaps he is so inured to art criticism that he sees things in the art that the layman will not. Either way, there is still a kind of perceptual divide between book and reader, and without an open mind, many who open this book may be enthralled by Gompertz's flair for describing the broad currents of art evolution and the larger-than-life personalities that shaped it. But many may, perversely, feel that continuing disconnect, and as a result see the book as only reinforcing the notion in their heads that, indeed, art isn't really their thing. I give this book:"

For those who have taken art history courses before (but are rusty, like me), this is a perfect light read --- not academic and overly detailed, but a refreshing narrative of the time, along with some fun anecdotes from the artists' perspectives (pseudo-fictional) and some readings of specific pieces by Gompertz that gives a nice framework for approaching new art. He is also, thankfully, candid about where modern art -- and curators like himself -- often slip into presumptuous, academic language, and the book is a good faith effort to avoid this. There are only two main drawbacks to the book. The first is that the number of pieces discussed vastly outnumbers those presented in figures or plates, meaning that my reading of this book was spent next to an open computer so I could look things up. His written descriptions of the pieces are accurate to a fault, but for anyone but an expert, you really need to see the piece to get it. I didn't hugely mind this, but I would honestly pay for a ""coffee table"" version of this exact book but with every substantively discussed piece present in at least a figure. The only other drawback, narratively, is that a degree of favoritism is definitely present throughout. It's less present in the book's first half, which does a thorough and even job describing the impressionists up through cubism, etc. But for more recent works, he digs much deeper into the artists he seems to aesthetically prefer, and gives little space or quickly rushes through all others. In particular, the Abstract Expressionists get short shrift compared to the Pop Art artists who followed (and derided) them. A shame, since I love both and especially AE. Still, for a book packed with a ton of raw information and art history, I tore through the book like a thriller, and making that subject matter that engrossing at a public level is a considerable achievement. I'd highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in the last 150 years of art!"

Will Gompertz writes an engaging, informative layman's introduction to modern and contemporary art (think late 1800s to today). It was fascinating to trace the rise of modern art in conjunction with the modern camera. With lenses to capture reality, artists no longer had to focus just on what they saw; art spread to philosophical concepts that deliberately deviated from familiar ways of viewing in order to direct the viewer's focus to other aspects of reality. Art started interacting not only with philosophy, but also with music, psychology, and the color wheel. Gompertz includes a fascinating discussion of how photography can limit art's effectiveness compared to the infinite perspectives of the human eye, which has fascinating applications for our current debates over using AI in visual and performative arts. While not every art form seemed worthwhile, I appreciated tracing the journey from the seen to the unseen, back to a more recent obsession with the seen. It's also interesting to see how contemporary swung from art like Warhol, which sought to remove the artist from the piece, to even more recent art making the artist themselves an integral part of the piece. As a side tangent, It was also interesting to hear the repeated cycle of establishment censure as each new art movement surfaced, followed by their eventual acceptance and understanding. Last night in a discussion with a friend, I was drawing some correlations between art history and the current refrains of censure in religious circles over fresh theological movements (e.g. sexual assault reform, social justice, and psychology) that will hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of Scripture. All in all a very thought-provoking book. It's harder to multitask and get the most out of the audiobook so I had to repeat sections, but it's well worth the time. I'm excited to go back to my local art museum and view more pieces with a better appreciation."

Lately, I have been seeking out accessible texts about modern art in an attempt to broaden the horizons of my own work which has largely skewed towards the naturalistic and representational, as most film and television does. Gompertz is the perfect guide for such a journey because he is both a former director of the Tate Modern and currently an editor and presenter at the BBC. Thanks to this background he has an uncanny, charming ability to distill the complexities of art history into digestible yet still thoughtful passages. ""What Are You Looking At?"" begins more or less with Manet and brings us through to more or less present-day with Ai Weiwei and Banksy. Gompertz dedicates a chapter or so to every major artistic movement of the last century and a half, but also takes time to pull back and introduce the reader to central ideas around the conception, creation, display, and perception of modern art. Though I deeply enjoyed every chapter, the sections on Jackson Pollack and Mark Rothko were probably the most illuminating because those are the two artists perhaps most maligned by detractors of modern art in the broader culture. Though the work is extremely accessible, Gompertz never talks down to you, challenging the reader with the complex ideas of some of the greatest modern art in a way that will leave you chewing on them after you finished the book. He also never lets you adrift, making sure the anchor his chapters in clear examples from each movement and major artist that you can pause and go appreciate on WikiArt before returning to the text. I would recommend ""What Are You Looking At?"" to anyone who wants to gain a firmer grasp on the various movements, artists, and ideas the comprise modern art. Though the book left me realizing I have a lot more to learn, I know now what direction to look in as I try to learn more."

'What Are You Looking At?' is virtually ideal for undertaking such a task. Firstly, it's important to make the point (as Gompertz himself does), that this is not an academic work, and as such, it is entirely possible that there are both factual inaccuracies and incorrect conclusions throughout a book that is primarily designed to provide an introduction to modern art, rather than a thorough dissection of the philosophies underpinning such movements as Dada, Bauhaus and Abstract Impressionism. That is not to say that it doesn't touch on all of these things, because it does, but not in any great depth, or in a way that is in any way critical of the motives and ideologies of the key players. As essentially an idiot's guide to the history of modern art, commencing in roughly the mid-19th century, as (in part due to the advent of photography), Impressionism started to diverge from the idea that art had to be an aesthetically pleasing representation of an image or person, and more of an embodiment of the human emotions within, as well as providing different visual perspectives that lie beyond the realm of photography. Where the book succeeds, is in drawing a fairly clear thread from the light-obsessed works of Monet and Turner, through such monumental cultural figures as Picasso and Van Gogh, and then through the conceptual art of the 20th and 21st century, which allows us to understand that in many respects, modern art is simply a continuation and development of what in pre-modern times was simply art. It has certainly heightened my appreciation of the works that I feel drawn towards, now that I understand where they sit in relation to each other, as well as identifying some fascinating connections that I had never really considered - most intriguingly the influence of the work of the wonderful Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcut prints of artists such as Hokusai and Hiroshige on European artists such as Van Gogh and Gaugin. If there is any major criticism of the book, it is surely that (outside of the Japanese art discussed above), it is a very Euro-American history of modern art. While there is some discussion of the influence of African art on Impressionism (now rather uncomfortable because this influence was in part due to the racist idea that Africa was home to savage and primitive people lacking in sophisticated culture, quite apart from any issues relating to cultural appropriation), one assumes that outside of initially Western Europe, and later Eastern Europe and the US, there wasn't simply a void of artistic expression, just a void of that story being told. And in fairness to Gompertz, these stories are not particularly in scope for a book that avowedly looks to help its readers to understand what they see in the Tate Britain or the MoMA, something which it does generally does exceedingly well. Perhaps the criticism should be reserved for the dealers and gallery owners that are ultimately responsible for an art world that marginalises certain types of art, because they don't fit into the grand Western tradition that all of the above artists now sit fairly comfortably within. Something to investigate further now I at least have a working knowledge to build on perhaps. Overall, Gompertz's book is a highly readable and entertaining starting point to a world that has so much to offer, and I definitely look forward to increasing my understanding in the future."

If you would like to go in any modern art museum and not feel stupid or be dismissive of the seemingly puerile art works, then this is the only book you need to read. It takes each of the major movements of what constitutes modern art, explains what the idea was behind it, presents succint biographies of its most important representatives, while also telling a short, interesting story. You get to know what these people were like, what the connections between them were, who they knew and who influenced whom. You also get to understand the socio-political realities that shaped these movements. In the bigger picture, you get to see how we got from majestic, realistic paintings of naked fat ladies to squiggles and colored rectangles that look like they've been made in Paint, and why these latter ones are just as interesting and valuable as the former. And I could test the value of this book first-hand. I can already tell what movement a certain painting belongs to, and even with contemporary art, I've frequently seen many references of the works mentioned in this book. I could make connections and understand all the factors that went into a movement, I could now see a work of art with different eyes. I could know why it is considered an important work of art in the first place, and I could also figure out what the artist was trying to achieve, even though all I was looking at was some globs of paint splashed against the canvas or a weird-looking sculpture. Finally, when someone goes ""Bah, my child could have done this!"" I can reply ""Well, actually..."" If you only have room for at most one book on modern art in your life, this can be it."

With versatile experience in modern arts, including as a former director at London's Tate Gallery, Will Gompertz guides you through the jungle of art movements since mid-1800s. Movement after movement and artist after artist he explains the artistic and intellectual fights and thoughts behind the artwork that many of us saw but could never really appreciate. The objective of the book is clear: to help us see what people paying millions of dollars and Euros for something that ""a four-year old could draw"", as well as art critics, see. With me, though, ""What Are You Looking At?"" accomplished a totally opposite result: it helped me realize that modern art is decidedly not my cup of tea. My idea has always been (and will always be) that art is something that I find beautiful. I will never be able to see beauty in maggots feeding off rotting meat (""A Thousand Years"" by Damien Hirst, 1990) or a white piece of paper, which is an artist's painting erased by another artist (""Erased de Kooning Drawing (1953) by Robert Rauschenberg, 1953)-just because they are universally thought to represent a vision of art. And thanks to Mr. Gompertz, I now know it for sure. I accept that he finds it beautiful (and he does, judging from the admiration he explains these and many other works with), and that someone wants to invest millions in them. I don't, and I won't. I believe, a book is great if the author makes the readers think and impacts them at least in some way. ""What Are You Looking At?"" made me think and helped determine where I stand on an area, which have always been important within my view of the world. It took a lot of passion, explaining, and details, and Will Gompertz is excellent at all of it. That's why, a resounding 5 of 5 from me."

It's the type of rare art book I've always wanted to read but didn't know existed — until now. What Are You Looking At is Will Gompertz's attempt to explain and summarize 150 years of modern art. The book spans over 450+ pages, but don't let the page count daunt you. It's split into 20 chapters, and every chapter rotates around different art movements/ideas, starting from Pre-Impressionism up until Post Modernism. One of the best highlights of the book, in my opinion, is the storytelling. Most art books I've read over the past tend to be analytical, which is a good thing for art connoisseurs but not for me. Gompertz found a way to explain art ideas interestingly for general readers, and he would occasionally question the readers about the basic underlying philosophy of certain art movements/ideas. Additionally, Gompertz also succeeds in writing about art from a holistic point of view — for example, the advent of Cubism was possible because of the 20th-century scientific revolution (Einstein, 4th-dimension, Wright Brothers). The book not only examines the lives of painters but also poets, curators, and scientists. And even though I was already familiar with some of the topics, I found several ideas or art movements that I've never heard of before. I can't think of a single bad thing about this book, to be honest. Maybe if you're a hardcore Art Conneiseur/Historian you'd barely learn anything at all. In summary, What Are You Looking At is an excellent modern art introductory book meant to be read by general readers. It's how an art book should've been written: exciting, informative, and inspiring."

As an open-minded newbie that wants to learn about modern art, this book surely is a very good start. The chapters build up chronologically, and read quite easily. The author nicely varies facts & concepts with anecdotes. Some of the works mentioned are illustrated in colour in the book. Most useful, but I strongly recommend checking out the Pinterest board of Krahn Fugel, containing references for *all* art works mentioned. Usually, I limit my books to be less than 320 pages. This was an unplanned exception of 430 pages, but I never had a feeling the book was dragging on. On the subject of modern art itself I'm left with mixed feelings. On one hand, I better understand the unique background of some of these art works, letting me appreciate them more. On the other hand, some more recent works feel to me as nothing to do with Arts but the more with the excesses of nowadays capitalism: a small group of plastic chosen ones, a pyramid system sold with an excellent marketing system and a snobistic elite. As the author mentions in the closing chapter, far more of my appreciation than to street artists like JR and Banksy who feel and nail today's issues (like climate, inequality, fundamentalism & polarisation) without the self-glorification of a Koons, Warholl, Murakami or WeiWei. Before starting this book, I had the intention to visit a modern arts museum once. Haven't done yet, but I'll try to avoid expositions I'd classify more in the pyramid system."

It was nice to have an overview of Modern Art, but the book left much to be desired and so does a lot of (modern day) Modern Art... I didn't get a sense of the deeper reasons why these art movements progressed. One quote in particular by Gompertz was enlightening: ""The French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard described Postmodernism as 'incredulity toward grand narrative,' meaning that Modernism's constant quest to find a single, all-encompassing solution to humanity's problems was considered silly, naïve and delusional by Postmodernists. They thought any new Big Ideas were as doomed to fail as all the other twentieth-century ""grand narratives"" had, like communism and capitalism."" I think many people (including myself) are turned off by today's Modern Art because the underpinning narrative is that everything is meaningless, nothing matters, and there is no true Truth. I think that this is naturally deeply disturbing to many people, even if we can't articulate it. And let's be honest, some of it is just rubbish. Will Gompertz never says that and has an ""everything thing is great and valid"" stance (at least in public writing). With all this said if you would like to pay a few million for a piece of ""performance art,"" you may... I have a ball of newspaper wrapped around a stick and I have a match. I light the match on fire and then light the newspaper wrapped around the stick on fire with the match and they both burn. I call it, ""Match Burning."" Deep, I know..."

It divides up modern up by different eras and dives into each one of them, from Pre-Impressionism from 1820 all the way to Conceptualism in the modern day. It uses an easy-to-digest manner to explain these art movements and their significance. # 🎨 Impressions The book was very difficult to keep my attention at first, but after going to many museums where I glanced over the painters that were mentioned in the book. The book became much more intriguing to me. I felt that the dots were connecting in my brain and that I was eager to learn more about those paintings that I have seen in the past. Although the book does not deep dive into every single artist, it gives a brief summary of their significance and provides me with a pointer on what I should be looking for in my own research. ## How I Discovered It An art school student recommended it to me. ## Who Should Read It? People who go to MOMA and ask “what am I looking at”? # ☘️ How the Book Changed Me - After reading the book, even though I am not 100% convinced about all of the art forms, I grew an appreciation for a lot of them and have developed my own taste in the recent art movements."

Gompertz writes in an approachable style without a lot of grotesque and meaningless art jargon and he makes a strong argument for the work he loves. I still think that much of modern art is essentially a scam being perpetrated by artists, galleries, critics and collectors and that it is basically a financial bubble like the Dutch tulip mania in the 1830s or crypto and NFTs today. (There are billions of dollars locked up in ugly, stupid, and often forged art . . . that bubble just has to pop one day, doesn't it? Anything as overvalued as modern art has to come down eventually, doesn't it? Ah, I can dream.) Nobody will ever convince me that de Kooning's work isn't fundamentally repulsive and lame, but through this book Gompertz has drawn my attention to a lot of interesting art and won me over to some of it. I wasn't bored for a moment. I listened to the audiobook, which is obviously the wrong way to do it because what you need when you are reading a book about art is lots of pictures of the art in question. So I listened to this over the course of a few weeks while out on walks, that way I could google the works in question and at least see a phone screen's view of them."

Gompertz provides a systematic, clearly explained (though slightly oversimplified - but that is to be expected from a ""popular"" book) history of modern art and mentions all the most notable names, movements, dates, and works. But all of this is integrated into a series of stories which make the book fun to read and the information in it just so easy to remember. I would definitely recommend reading it rather than listening to it even though all the works are easy to visualize the way Gompertz describes them. You can always look them up, but this is just an unnecessary complication and gets in the way of really enjoying the book. Even though the book is quite basic, which is to be expected from something that covers such a broad range of subjects, I think a good number of professionals (art historians, art history students, museologists, gallery-workers, etc.) could definitely benefit from Gompertz's simple approach to art and, more importantly, his uncomplicated way of writing about art."

I would expect: a lavishly illustrated photo book with some descriptive text. Instead, this is a text-heavy work of nonfiction with 68 small pictures. The text consisted mostly of written descriptions of artworks not shown! I wouldn't have persisted except that it was a well-organized overview of artists and art movements. When the author (a Tate director and art writer) wrote about artists and ""isms,"" I liked the tone. Maybe it was partly due to my interests, but I found all of the chapters on post-WW2 art much more interesting than the chapters on earlier eras. I looked up all the not-depicted art works on Google, which is why I laboured over the book for 6 months. Ultimately it was a good jumping-off point: it highlighted lots of art I want to explore further. If someone has a new interest in modern art, I'd suggest - after going to as many shows as possible - to browse lots of photo books, and visit the web sites of artists, galleries and museums. After that, delve into the stories of selected artists and works."

It is interesting, but lacking in visuals. After a while, it becomes tedious to read about art pieces that are only mentioned but not shown in the book. I used to read it with my phone by my side to google the art, but reading with your phone near is never a good idea, so I had a really hard time staying focused. The writing is good but as any mainstream art storyteller, not much is said about female artists without making emphasis on their sexual lives. Did this book change how I perceive modern art? YES. I have more appreciation and respect for it, though I reaffirmed my repulsion for Damien Hirst's work XD The physical copy I have is made of fine-thin paper and it was uncomfortable to flip through the pages as they stuck together a lot. I believe this book could work better as several volumes in a bigger size including a lot more images. More like something you would have on a bookshelf or coffee table. But It is clear the intention was to make it more pocket size for reading during commutes or something, but the lack of images was really off-putting for me."

I love the Impressionists, but the art movements that came after them often feel inexplicable and opaque to me. I was hoping this book could help me understand and appreciate the art I see in galleries...and to some extent I think it will help do that. Gompertz argues that judging art isn't the point; history will tell us if something was ""good."" The best way he says to appreciate art is by understanding its place in the history and development of art movements. He's not wrong; I do think I better understand why a Rothko is ""art"" now than I did before. But I also think that thesis is my main issue with the book. History can certainly tell us if a work is important and influential. Understanding how a piece was influenced by and influenced other works is interesting on an intellectual level. But art, to me, shouldn't be intellectual and thinky. Great art should make me feel something, even if its just disgust or distaste. And I'm not sure this book got me any closer to being moved by monochrome squares on canvas or sculptures of boxes than I was before I read it."

It was especially true with Kandinsky, whose painting started dancing, and vibing, and talking to me - everything all of sudden once the book advised that it's best to listen to Wagner's music while watching it. The book as a whole is insightful and easy to follow, and it catches the spirit of each artistic movement - the key 'why it happened and what's cool about it' questions are answered in every chapter. So, if you feel like you don't understand contemporary art, the book helps to trace the art journey from Impressionism to the commercial/political art dichotomy we witness today. It indeed shows what happened to modern art during the last 150 years in a nutshell. Plus, it has many visual references, so you can start connecting dots while watching the next museum exhibition. Which is already a big step from understanding nothing about contemporary art to starting to see something familiar in it."

As it turns out, especially for someone not knowledgeable, this is a very good book. It spans art from the late 1800s to this decade, and does so with equanimity and a little humor. Gompertz includes enough personal information on the artists to understand, and while at times I wonder about his interpretation of meanings behind the art I learned much and can now appreciate much of what before reading the book I would have expressed skepticism or scoffed. While there are plenty of illustrations both in the text and inserted in full color I found it helpful to look at those not illustrated on the internet. The author provided descriptions of each non-illustrated piece to add to his information about the artist and the work. Divided into styles, the book reads well and provided perspective, history, and insight into each style. I found it interesting and informative. A good read."

In particular, he gives the reader lucid, captivating portraits of both broad artistic trends and the individual creators whose works populated those trends. This largely compelling survey could have gone deeper in places rather than going broad; there were several occasions where I wished we were hearing more about an artist or a particular work rather than using that space to touch briefly on yet one more artist who mattered at least minimally to a movement. (I also would have liked to see even more images in the book, though I'm happy to forgive that lack because I know that it might have been prohibitively expensive or legally challenging to include more artwork.) The book, ultimately greater than the sum of its parts, offered me exactly what I was seeking: additional context and detail regarding modern art, which I already appreciated in museums but which I can now approach more knowledgeably and analytically than before."

I learned a lot about my favorite type of art. Overall, greatly enjoyable. In general, the author does a great job of making a subject that is notoriously difficult to understand feel relatable and understandable. Where I feel the book was a bit of a let-down was that the author uses concepts and words that he doesn't explain -- he'll say that a piece of art has excellent ""structure"" or ""movement"", and while I vaguely understand what he's talking about, every time I feel like we move back a bit in the mission to make art understandable. I didn't love that the author talks a lot about how different artists ""believed"" in various concepts, but doesn't really go deep enough into what exactly a belief meant to these people. I would love to have a better background of what an artist's background knowledge and thought process looks like -- I find it difficult to imagine that they literally believed these things as much as thinking of them as interesting and worth developing out. Overall, worth reading, but I think would have benefitted from skipping out on contemporary art and putting a little bit of extra time into background of an artist's thought process. 3.5/5"

It's amusing to read thanks to Will's honest attempt at educating rather than telling us. That brings me to my first gripe with the book: extensive use of exquisite and eloquent English words that make it a drag to read for someone like me whose English isn't their native language. Some sentences are ridiculous. I ""fixed"" this by reading from context: a heavyweight book like this doesn't exactly invite you to open up a dictionary. My second problem are the last few chapters after Modernism where the artists follow up each other in a much higher tempo than before. It gives me the impression everyone isn't that important and discourages me to look up stuff on the 'net. Of course the more recent, the more volatile the subject becomes so that's to be expected. That said, I learned a great deal in the process of reading it!"

I greatly appreciate his explanation of post-modernism, and his notes on the lack of women in art history. Also very fresh is Gompertzs' unhidden enthusiasm about some artists; he doesn't try to be objective in his tastes. Sometimes he overdoes it a bit with his metaphors though, distracting from the actual content of the artworks he describes. This book was written in 2012 and I'd really like to read an updated version (already) since an analogy where Harvey Weinstein is mentioned would now surely be edited out, and maybe Baroness Freytag-von Loringhoven would get a small mention in the chapter about ""the Fountain""? I am very inspired to make art and read more about art and see more art. That's a great book to me."

Author Will Gompertz does a good job of explaining what the impressionists were up to, and how the post-impressionists and subsequent art movements responded to both currents in art and current events. He is persuasive in identifying Marcel Duchamp as a really pivotal influence on modern art and also helped me understand Kandinsky's approach better (I have always been moved by his work but had less understanding of what he was up to). Gompertz is less convincing about artists who are more contemporary--he provides great context but tends to ask rhetorical questions like, ""Is it powerful?"" assuming that because some piece of conceptual art appeals to him, it is self-evidently compelling. On the whole, though, it is a good read, and nice overview of modern-to-contemporary art movements."

I felt they made of art way more than was intended by the artist. Probably I just didn’t understand what they were talking about. It seems an extra step to accessing art that just made things more obscure and more complicated than necessary. That said I did think this re-view was extremely helpful in getting a look at the directions art has taken in “modern” times. And why. So I found this to be an interesting and insightful read. Confirming what I knew with a lot I did not know. I felt the ending lumped a lot of work and thought into the last chapter, Which I think could have been coined “Sensationalism”. Following it by a few more chapters on other directions I believe art has taken. Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very smart without being pedantic."

Written for non-academics in a light-hearted and humorous way, this is both well-researched and as thorough as they come. Will Gompertz, the BBC Arts Editor, connects the strands as they develop and places them in the context of the period. This is all achieved in a straight forward manner, but is made more exciting by little humorous anecdotes about the artists, their art-dealers and their followers. There are so many reference to artworks over and above those illustrated in the book that you will need the internet at hand too! An overview of the movements and artists displayed as a map of stations and lines on the London Tube starts the book, and is very useful to refer to throughout."

I didn't possess the language, the knowledge or insight to gain pleasure or appriciation from it. But I desperately wanted to understand, to ""get it"" and this book has really opened my eyes in a way that has been so enjoyable, it was a subject that I really knew nothing about, and I can safely say I learnt something every time I picked the book up. It was so easy to read, accessible and enjoyable. I'd even consider reading other art books after this. I genuinely think this book has changed my perspective on art and have made me notice things in life that I never would've attended to before."

The book shines more during the moments where the author makes sure to get his own thoughts across. No wonder it was written by a journalist. Sometimes the writing feels a little too informative and, well, journalistic. The reading was a little slow at times and there were chapters that felt more like a compilation of historical moments than a human journey through the history of modern art. The moments with less textbook analysis of artworks and more bias and commentary made the reading way more enjoyable. One thing the book does really well is making you feel like you're learning constantly, page after page. Although the preface clarifies that this is not a textbook, most of it has a very similar flavor. Of course, if you're looking to learn about modern art and prioritize information over bias, this is the book for you. Sadly, this wasn't my case, I was definitely expecting a more opinionated piece. I guess that's the problem with expectations."

While the author does much to explain the value of many criticized movements, his explanation ultimately brings up the same old questions without addressing them. To wit: (1) if art is to provoke, it must be that viewers go to it to BE provoked, then is this real provocation, and is the only kind of art which can be art guerilla art? (2) if art makes increasing demands of the viewer in interpreting or reflecting on the object, how close are we to the point where art is indistinguishable from anything else on which we might reflect? Once made, that point need not be made over and over again, or, to the point, what remains to justify buying a Koons over a commercial pencil sharpener?"

Made me appreciate abstract art more than I did before. Some drawbacks that prevent a five star review are: - the writer goes a bit too far in his analysis sometimes. A few times, very strenuous metaphors are suggested that only make the analysis seem absurd rather than helping to understand an artwork. (mohair goats referring to mohair woven into an army outfit?) - the cartoon drawings aren't funny and don't add further insight. I would have preferred the book stick purely to text and inclusions of the artworks (which I would have liked more of - remove the cartoon art and you have more space for them!) - Doesn't include a few artists I was expecting like Yayoi Kusama and Lee Krasner (she's a footnote in Jackson Pollock's chapter). Excusable because the book only has so much space."

There are a lot of modern paintings and sculptures I don't quite understand because when I look at them I think: ""Is this really art? It looks like something a child could draw/make."" But, this book answers that question. This is a great book if you're interested in art because it presents modern art in a way layman can understand it. It is also very interesting because it gives a lot of important details about paintings, painters and art styles in the last 150 years. However, I do think that there should be more pictures of paintings and sculptures. The author describes them in detail but I would like to se them as well so I had to google some of them. To conclude, amazing book for all art lovers!"

I loved it. I was consistently surprised to find art I'd accepted as typical or even old (Cezanne) reframed as total radical once I knew the history of its evolution. Art museums will forever be more interesting to me now. I was pretty annoyed that it was super western centric and also uh there were like four women ever mentioned in the 150 years surveyed... but it does unfortunately tell the dominant history of mainstream modern art as most know it... sad. But I do highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the broader story of modern art."

For instance, Diego Rivera is included only as the husband of Frida Kahlo. None of the muralists are mentioned. No Calder, Wyeth, Hopper, O’Keeffe, Whistler, American impressionist, Schnabel, Porter, Fischl, Holzer or the Ash Can School. The list could go on and on. Is that a problem. The title is What Am I Looking At. When you look at a Wyeth, you know pretty much what you are looking at, same with Hopper. You could say the same about the French Impressionists and Post Impressionist that make up the first chapters of the book. However, once they are dispensed with, you go into the land of “my kindergartner could do that.” Work that could use an assist from an art world insider. Here Gompertz shines. He raises those niggling questions that part of our brain raises as we look at a stack of blocks that would look like a massive Jenga game if it were anywhere but the Tate or MoMA. He does this with great humor and charm. My understanding of Conceptual Art and Minimalism was raised a notch or two. I am still suspicious of Performance Art, Conceptual Art, and much that follows Pop Art. I get what he says; I still feel like I’m being taken for a ride by Warhol. Jeff Koons gets some space. Blessedly little. If some areas of modern art have always mystified you and Sister Wendy didn’t clear it up, Gompertz, might just. While I was reading this, I saw Gompertz on an old episode of Pointless Celebrity. He was knocked out in the first round. Sad. I was hoping to spend some time with him."

At 400 pages it has to cuta lot of stuff out but this brevity allows it to cover many movements and the links between them without bogging you, the reader, down in unneccessary detail. And all this done in a warm tone with even the occasional joke thrown in. The author's passion for art is evident and it passes very easily across to you. I'm just itching to see some art and view it with new fresh eyes! I can't recommend it enough as a starting point for the wild, jargon-filled world of modern art."

As written on the back of the book: ""the teacher that you always wanted but never had"". Will Gompertz has a creative-funny-smart style of writing and he can connect modern art in a marvelous and surprising ways: you will always be wondering what is around the corner. And is not just art, be prepared for a ride down the rabbit hole: you'll be left wondering about the french revolution, world wars, communism, up to 2008's financial crisis and mankind's quintessential questions. It took me forever and a day to read this book as I was stopping each time to google every artist so I definitely loved the adventure!"

I don't remember why I put it down, but I'm thrilled that I picked it up again. One of my greatest laments of my college education was I dropped out of survey of Western Art, twice. I've always said when I retired I would go back and take the course. Over the years I've read a lot of art history books in an effort to compensate. This one has been a true Delight. I remember touring MoMA with the abstract expressionist artist G Edward Beckett asking him explain to me just what the hell I was looking at. He prepared me for this book. I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to spend some time with these infuriating, infatuating and intriguing artists."

Will Gompertz does so easily due to his experience in the museum industry. This work takes the reader through the arc of modern art, beginning with impressionism and ending with post-modernism and performance art. Trying to create a ""canon"" of art is a fool's errand, and Gompertz recognizes this, instead making sure to explain his choices and biases up front. He never claims that this is the end-all-be-all work on modern art history, and encourages the reader to keep exploring even when they finish the book."

I am more confident now while looking at some modern stuff. I feel that the other books and articles will add to the story depth developing it with more granular details. I enjoyed this book a lot.

This knowledge is coupled with an empathy for the artistic inventiveness of those calling their work ART. Sometimes his explanations work; for instance, he has a high regard for Marcel Duchamp and explains his work throughout the 20th century with great clarity. My problem in understanding his interpretations confuse art with philosophy. To me, the result of art is beauty, an ecstatic sense of wonder. His definition of art includes a much broader category of ideas and behaviors. This book tells its story chronologically. Generally, it is quite funny and tells the story very well.

Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"When I started reading in my teenage years, thrillers and self-help books were my favorites. But reading too many books in these genres might have changed my outlook toward them. These books now consistently fail to excite me. Most of the thrillers aren't whimsical enough and self-help felt too repetitive and preachy for my liking. So I gradually shifted my focus to literary fiction and more poignant books. But still, there are some extraordinary creations that I come across every now and then in this genre that simply amuses me. This book is one such one. I impulsively purchased all these three books many years ago from a bookstore as I was instantly attracted to the layout of these books. But sadly, I accidentally lost all these three books along with some others while shifting my home. Recently I purchased all three books again and took this one for reading instantly. I simply loved the reading experience this book gave me due to three reasons - One of the major problems that self-help books are facing now is the time the authors take to get into the proper subject. Austin Kleon has done a wonderful job of getting straight to the topic from the first page itself without wasting the time of the readers. - Most of the recent self-help books focus on one topic. The authors keep repeating the same thing from multiple angles to make the readers understand the concept thoroughly and increase the page count. Sometimes these repetitions become too intense and give the readers a dull experience. Barring one exception, I can't point out a single part repeated unnecessarily (the only exception is mentioned later in this review) in this book. - Writing a self-help book in this layout is a tricky one. The readers will understand the core theme of the book by just skimming through it. So if the author has not done brilliant work and is not confident about what he wrote for the book, this method can totally backfire as there is a chance that the readers might DNF the book just after five minutes of reading or won't even purchase the book. The author has written in a coruscating way and this layout perfectly complements the author's writing style. He never becomes officious or annoyingly preachy in any part of this book This book will be a huge blessing for those who are artists or are planning to start their influencer journey on social media. If you feel the path lying ahead is onerous, I request you to kindly read this book. Please don't expect any extraordinary idea that will change your life from the very second you start reading it. But I guarantee you that you will at least get three simple ideas that you haven't thought of before, which will change your career as an artist or influencer journey in the best way possible in the long run. This might appear silly, but this is one of the biggest plus points of this book. Just look at the above photograph from this book's blurb. Every important content of this book is shared in the blurb. The author takes us deep into the book's core in the blurb itself. I haven't seen any author showing this much confidence in their work and sharing it all in the blurb itself. (This is a technique that authors should carefully manage while trying to implement it. It can work only in a few genres, including self-help, while it will totally backfire in some others. I have seen a couple of authors who wrote thrillers trying to do the same thing and totally destroying the overall reading experience.) The author shows us how to show our work right from the blurb of this book. Social media doesn't work in that way. If you look at most of the influencers, they were not the best in the field when they started. They were just amateurs like others who had a passion for something. They bravely shared their work, the process behind the screen, and the effort behind their work. They might have made a lot of mistakes. They were never reluctant to admit their mistakes and take us along with them on their journey. It is not perfection that is the necessity for starting your influencer journey. It is passion and the readiness to work hard that makes a person a great influencer. The author has shared this idea in a brilliant manner in this book. If you are a content creator on the internet, the author gives you some basic advice that will be helpful to you. The author says that the best way to create your resume is right at your fingertips, which most of you are sadly not utilizing. Your resume shouldn't be a two or three-page document but your whole social media accounts. This is a trend we can see if we closely observe the careers of many successful authors. We can also see this trend in many other spheres of life. For example, most of the current pop singing sensations started their journey as cover song singers on YouTube. Some of them deleted their earlier content after they became successful. But I recently read a book about a celebrity where she said that she hadn't deleted any of her earlier works so that it would inspire others who are in the nascent stage of their career. I checked her social media account and was surprised to see a struggling artist's struggles laid bare before the public. We can see her brilliant evolution right before our eyes as time progressed in her account and how she became a famous celebrity now. We can similarly see many critical reviews written by many famous contemporary authors on Goodreads before they started writing books. We can see the evolution in their writing skills and techniques before they became successful writers. This is an idea that will help to identify and wipe out predators from your life so that you become more productive in it. If you are sharing your work on social media, you will obviously have to face criticism. You can see people who constructively criticize and sadistic people who just want to irritate you. The author brilliantly depicts ways we can handle them in this book. The author shares two different ideas about networking and connecting with a community in this book. In one part, he is saying to work hard and put the best content online; then, the right people will come to you to connect with you. In another part of this book, he says, He even paraphrases other writers like Blake Butler by mentioning the open mode. There is some truth in both the ideas the author is sharing. But he should have expressed his opinion rather than projecting these two ideas onto the readers, which might confuse them. I haven't given a five-star rating for a self-help book for some time now (apart from a couple of favorite books, which I reread every once in a while). This book deserves five stars and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a social-media influencer or is planning to become one soon in the future. ————————————————————————— | | | | | |"

I didn't expect anything different here. I mean, the book's exactly the same size and shape, the same layout, similar in approach. But this one hit me right between the eyes half a dozen times over. I immediately started rereading this one, a library copy, and bought this one and Steal Like an Artist. I suspect that I didn't click with the first one because I read it too quickly and didn't really let it settle in. Or maybe it just speaks to a different stage of the artistic journey than I'm on. But Show Your Work... Oh, goodness. The second night I was reading it, I sat up four hours past my bedtime curating photo streams, removing the junk and the fluff, the ""so what?"" stuff that Austin speaks about. I kept in the stream photos of things-in-process, whether my new attempts at sketchnoting (and I'm NOT a drawing artist) or my attempts at yoga (I'm a middle-aged guy, inflexible and newb-like). I culled old photos of lattes and omelettes. I moved nearly two hundred photos of my family - fine snapshots, but not where I found creative inspiration for this stream - from my photo stream up to Facebook, where more folks are enjoying them as family photos anyway. Grandma and friends are there, not waiting on my photo streams. Four hours. I also wrote six pages of journal notes, some by hand, some electronically; began to reshape my 9-year-old blog that I've left to die many times over. I revisited the great question of how I can find the metanarrative between all my distinct interests and outputs, to see what the main through-line is. It's not just Show Your Work alone that sparked this - it was also much of David Whyte's poetry and lectures, as well as learning to doodle note and sketch note - but Kleon's book shaped and unblocked so much. I can't recommend this book highly enough, and I'll be rereading Steal Like An Artist when my purchased copy of it shows up too."

Because if ever there's a book that embodies the genre Show Your Work is it. Despite that, you may want to consider buying the book. Because while Austin Kleon really doesn't offer a single new idea, it is possible that his amiable presentation of the ideas will trigger you to act on them. In short, the emperor has no clothes, but it may not matter. It's a Quick Read Which translates to, this is a small book. Don't let the 224 pages full you, the book has a lot of illustrations so the pages fly by. I read it in three days in between reading parts of three other books. It doesn't take long at all to consume the information presented here. Austin Kleon's writing style is fairly basic but pleasant enough. He does a solid job of explaining what he means, if you were in any doubt about it. But one of the reasons it's such a quick read is that there is very little substance backing up these basic ideas that he is presenting. He gives you the concept but doesn't present any methods of execution. I guess that is left as an exercise for the reader. Honestly I've only ever read maybe three how-to/self-help books that I would say actually helped me. In each case those books gave specifics, not generalizations. The industry however is very much built on genericization and that's exactly what we have here. Quotes From People Who Know The book is packed with quotes from successful people (who all also happen to be active on the internet) and surprise surprise they generally agree with Austin's approach. The idea obviously is to reinforce Austin's message. But it's a bit misleading because he never gives an opposing viewpoint any page time. If you read this book you'll come away thinking that all successful creative people take the same broad approach which, factually, they don't. The other problem is it relies on a popular logical fallacy. The notion that since someone is successful they know why they are successful. In truth though, most do not actually know this. They can speculate but they have no way to know what level of success they would have achieved taking a different approach. It's a common technique in how-to books and there's a certain used-car salesman feel to this level of hard sell (particularly when I've already got the book). Where's The Beef? If you skim the sample available on Amazon (which is very brief and mostly contains the contents pages) you'll see the titles of the chapters (the 10 ways) and those titles pretty much tell you what you're going to get in each chapter. The problem is there's really not a lot more substance on offer. Kleon explains the why of each idea, but he really doesn't go into how. And for me at least, the how is the bit that really matters. This is the bit where, almost invariably, how-to books fall down. Instead of wasting page after page with content free quotes, how about actually mapping out some examples of putting a plan into action? A Collection of Tweets The author mentions at one point that the origin of this volume is in a series of tweets. It shows. I don't actually have an issue with any of the ten ideas (though I'm not doing the meet in real life thing ever) but as presented here they are completely unconnected. There's no flow to the book. No sense of one element building on the next until at the end you have a plan. Instead... here's a thought. Here's another thought. Here's a third thought. So it's shallow, disjointed and really not remotely original. And yet it's being gushed over. So, if nothing else, it should encourage you that utilizing this approach to publicity can work for a creator. Who Is This For? Are you struggling with or new to social media? Do you want to promote yourself and your creations but have no idea how? Are you looking for a quick read that hits the high points of the accepted wisdom on how to do this? Do you just need something to spark your own ideas? This one might be for you. Did You Like It? No, not really. I found it frustrating and overly shallow. I can honestly say there wasn't a single idea in there I hadn't heard before. It's nicely presented, but I don't understand the rave reviews. I might have felt a little more lenient if it hadn't been so heavily recommended."

The good thing is that book was surprisingly about writing and authors too, in addition to art, business and all kind of stuff. The book is easily read within one hour but I think it kind of motivated me to be afraid less and be proud more of what I do. The book won’t drastically change my life and most of the things it mentions are logical things but it was kind of good to read these things!

Anyone involved in the creative process should read this book. It's a tiny, lovely book with flowcharts within. It's short enough to read in one sitting. It lays out methods to think about your work as a never-ending process, how to grow an audience by sharing that process, and how to deal with the ups and downs that come with putting yourself and your work out there in the world in ten short chapters: It shifted my perspective on sharing information on the internet. Encouraged me to post more frequently and with less decoding wait. It made me feel more at ease about sharing my thoughts and work on the internet.

As a writer and an artist, his advice is simple, inspiring, and fun to follow. I still use that book as a reference when I need a pick-me-up. His new book, Show Your Work!, feeds the need for those of us who wanted more! It's the same format - quick chapters with full page black and white photos, quotes from famous folks that you will be pinning to your studio walls,lots of his newspaper blackout phrases, and the same simple noteworthy advice that Kleon is so good at! Building off of his first book, Kleon encourages the artist, writer, or anyone creative to dig a bit deeper to reach their audience. He teaches you how to introduce yourself at a party, how not to be human spam, to tell good stories, to share something small everyday, to build a mailing list. But then there are good life lessons like stepping away from what you are doing, or starting over, teach what you know, think process not product, and so much more. If you are looking for a step-by-step how-to guide to getting rich and famous at novel writing or art selling, this isn't it. But if you want a fun cheerleader-type book chocked full of good advice that's to the point and easy to follow, Kleon is your man. This book would make a great gift for the artist in your life, if you aren't one yourself. But as an artist or writer, you have to follow through! Follow him on Twitter, do the little things he suggests, scratch each others' backs, and show your work! It really works - removing the stress from your creativity and helping you to step back and see the bigger picture! I always feel energized and ready to dive in after reading his books. And I will definitely be buying extra copies to share with my artist friends, and am already anxiously waiting for the next one! Kleon calls himself a writer who draws; he's also a genius!"

It definitely changed my life and may surpass that Anything you Want by Derek Sivers book (that I want to re-read now) that originally took third place in my top three books of all time.

And I could add, whenever we talk, we're always telling stories. Why do we write or make art or pursue creativity of any sort? The answer? To be more ourselves, to show who we are, to make a connection, to find our tribe. Austin Kleon, the author of this book is a ""writer who draws"" and in sharing himself here, he takes his readers deep into the element of connecting. In particular, he offers up suggestions of how to get your work out there. He's an advocate of using the tools of the day (aka social media) to #ShowYourWork, while also learning to ""take a punch"" (survive the criticism that naturally comes from putting yourself out there) and avoiding the harmful trolls. This is a very short book that you'll want to begin rereading immediately after you finish. Sometimes you don't need to say a lot to say something profound. That's what you'll find here. If you don't get any inspiration from reading this book, I'd check your pulse."

I have to admit that I picked it up with some skepticism, just as I did with Steal Like an Artist. This follow-up has the same slick look about it, with Kleon's subtractive poetry and ample quotes from other artists. But, just as with the other book, as soon as I started reading, I was sold on it. I loved what this book had to say. The Goodreads summary covers the bullet points well, but what I liked most was his emphasis on how to make quality connections. A huge number of followers really means nothing if they don't care about what you do. It's about being part of a community, more than creating a network. After all, you create things because are a fan. Find the other fans and you will find your audience, too. This approach meshes perfectly with the first book. Here, he shows how to make it possible for other artists to ""steal"" from you. Brilliant. It's by no means exhaustive, but I feel like these suggestions will set an artist on the right path. It will be much better than shouting into the twitter void hourly about how your book is available at Amazon for 99 cents. (I cannot believe how many people seem to think this is a good idea.)"

That hasn't worked out the way I planned. I've come around to Austin Kleon's way of thinking: I love the encouragement to share my work as I'm doing it, rather than hoarding it until it's polished and perfect. The book is breezy and short, but I found nuggets of inspiration. I'm eager to put some of his advice into effect and see if it makes a difference."

But a detailed view would help those who might feel a bit directionless. 1. You don’t have to be a genius. 2. Think process, not product. 3. Share something small every day. 4.

But what I do get out of them are reminders. In this case, to ""Show your work"". Austin Kleon is compelling with his ten tips on what he believes are different ways in which you can show your work. Work that is tangible, work that is an act of constant progress and work that while humble, is effective. Both, from a sense that demonstrates your growing skill in any field that you choose to show your work in, and in a sense that you have the satisfaction of having journaled work sufficiently to look back on time well spent. Now much of what I've said above are what I interpretively took away from the book. and not what was exactly said in it. And I think that is the job of the book well done. In fact, at this point in time I cannot even remember the ten tips that he's provided. I think there is one that relates to social media, one that tells you that if you show your work, people will find you, a couple of quotes and ...I don't know. More stuff. But the point is, it made me remember to work on sharing my work but more importantly, Doing the work. Work isn't meant to be done to be shared. The sharing should be a natural action that follows the doing, but the doing is not an option. This was a good book for simply reminding me about things I knew but hadn't taken consciously seriously. I will likely read it again."

This is like a condensed version of Real Artists Don't Starve, Jeff Goins rather good book on keeping it together as an artist and making a buck too, but Kleon's is much shorter and sweeter. The 10 chapter headings are pointers to a fruitful, moral creative life in the internet age: 1. You Don't Have to Be a Genius 2. Think Process, Not Product 3. Share Something Small Everyday 4. Open Up Your Cabinet of Curiosities 5. Tell Good Stories 6. Teach What You Know 7. Don't Turn Into Human Spam 8. Learn To Take a Punch 9. Sell Out. 10. Stick Around. And, as a former obituary writer myself, I was delighted to discover Kleon recommends reading the obits every day. There's nothing like an interesting obit to remind you that we all die, but that there is so much that can be done while we're still breathing, and you might as well get on with it while you are. And. as Kleon says, a bad review never killed anyone yet. Get out there and get on with your art.

It’s about taking one small step every day until the progress is a complete project. I used to have and still have negative thoughts about sharing work and making a big fool outta myself in front of everyone. But it never occurred to me that, by sharing what I like to do or I think I am good at, might actually benefit someone out there. Also, it opens up doors to new ideas, new friends, and new opportunities. If it hadn’t for this book, I wouldn’t have become okay with the idea of putting myself out there."

And there is going to be struggle in both of them. This book was about how to make your work more meaningful and how to struggle better with work. Last year, through a friend and through a YouTube video on productivity I found this book. I had started posting stories on my Instagram after getting inspired by a friend who worked in digital marketing and content creation. Even though I wasn't doing quality work, I wanted my work to be seen. See, the narcissist inside me is talking. The boy is dreaming of a hot breakfast without caring to get out of his bed. It was a short book that I had finished in one night in February. I was offshore, and it was the changeover from night shift to day shift, I just couldn't sleep. I found myself nodding my head all along with the book, sometimes I found my eyes getting wider when I desperately wanted them to narrow down me to sleep. There was a line in the beginning—""Imagine if your next boss didn't have to read your résumé because he already reads your blog."" I sighed. This book promises to deliver 10 ways to share your creativity and get discovered. For selfish reasons, I'd summarize those 10 ways, in case I forget them in days to come. Find a Scenius. Find like-minded individuals and groups. Lone genius is a myth. Creativity is collaboration. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others. Be an amateur. Contributing something is better than contributing nothing. In the beginner's mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind, there are few. Wear your amateurism on your sleeve. You can't find your voice if you don't use it. Talk about things you love. Your voice will follow. Read Obituaries. They are a near death experience for the rest of us. It reminds you that every day is an extra day, and you have to make the most out of it. Take people behind the scenes. Work is a process not a thing. “People really do want to see how the sausage gets made. By putting things out there, consistently, you can form a relationship with your customers. It allows them to see the person behind the products.” Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of your working. This isn’t about making art, it’s simply keeping track of what’s going around. Research. Reference. Drawings. Plans. Sketches. Interviews. Audio. Photographs. Video. Pinboards. Journals. Drafts. Prototypes. Demos. Diagrams. Notes. Inspirations. Scrapbooks. Stories. Collections. Send out a daily dispatch. Once a day, after you’ve done your work day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. If you are in early stage — share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you are in the middle of executing a project — write about your methods or share works in progress. If you have just completed a project — show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned. Daily dispatch can be a blog post, an email, a tweet, a YouTube video, or some other little bit of media. Don’t worry about being on every platform; pick and choose based on what you do and the people you’re trying to reach. Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work. The “so what?” test. I had a professor in college who returned our graded essays, walked up to the chalkboard, and wrote in huge letters: “SO WHAT?” She threw the piece of chalk down and said, “Ask yourself that every time you turn in a piece of writing.” It’s a lesson I never forgot. Turn your flow into stock. Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people that you exist. Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. Maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background. Stock is best made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon your flow. Build a good (domain) name. One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. My blog has been my sketchbook, my studio, my gallery, my storefront, and my salon. Absolutely everything good that has happened in my career can be traced back to my blog. My books, my art shows, my speaking gigs, some of my best friendships—they all exist because I have my own little piece of turf on the Internet. Your website is not a self-promotion machine, it is a self-invention machine. “Build a good name. Keep your name clean. Don’t make compromises. Don’t worry about making a bunch of money or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work . . . and if you can build a good name, eventually that name will be its own currency. Don’t be a hoarder. “The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually, you’ll become stale. If you give away everything you have, you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish . . . Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.” — Paul Arden The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading. “I’m basically a curator. Making books has always felt very connected to my bookselling experience, that of wanting to draw people’s attention to things that I liked, to shape things that I liked into new shapes.” Our tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast shadow over our own work. No guilty pleasures. We all love things that other people think are garbage. You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage, because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences, the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed “high” and the “low”. When you find things you genuinely enjoy, don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it. Credit is always due. Always give proper credits to people whose work you share, otherwise you are not only robbing the creator of the credits but you are also robbing your audience of the original work. Work doesn’t speak for itself. “The cat sat on a mat’ is not a story. ‘The cat sat on the dog’s mat’ is a story.” — John le Carré If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. When shown an object, or given a food, or shown a face, people’s assessment of it—how much they like it, how valuable it is—is deeply affected by what you tell them about it.” Structure is everything. If you study the structure of stories, you start to see how they work, and once you know how they work, you can then start stealing story structures and filling them in with characters, situations, and settings from your own life. Talk about yourself at parties. You should be able to explain your work to a kindergartner, a senior citizen, and everybody in between. Tell the truth and tell it with dignity and self-respect. “Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful.” Strike all adjectives from your bio. You’re not an “aspiring” photographer, and you’re not an “amazing” photographer, either. You’re a photographer. Don’t get cute. Don’t brag. Just state the facts. Share your trade secrets. Don’t worry about the competition. “The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.” — Annie Dillard. Shut up and listen If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community. You want hearts, not eyeballs. If you want followers, be someone worth following. Be a more interesting person. If you want to be interesting, you have to be interested. Being good at things is only thing that earns you clout or connections. The vampire test. If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Vampires cannot be cured. When you come across a vampire, banish it from your life forever. Identify your fellow knuckleballers. When you pin your kind, you get your team. The people who share your obsessions, the people who share a similar mission to your own, the people with whom you share a mutual respect. Meet up in meatspace. Meet people in the real life. Let ‘em take their best shot. Relax and breathe. Strengthen your neck. Get hit a lot. Take lots of criticism. The more criticism you take, the more you realize it can’t hurt you. Roll with the punches. Having your work hated by certain people is a badge of honour. Protect your vulnerable areas. Keep your balance. Your work is something you do, not who you are. Don’t feed the trolls. “There’s never a space under paintings in a gallery where someone writes their opinion,” says cartoonist Natalie Dee. “When you get to the end of a book, you don’t have to see what everyone else thought of it.” For troll problems, use the block button on social media sites. Even the renaissance had to be funded. “An amateur is an artist who supports himself with outside jobs which enable him to paint.” Said artist Ben Shahn. “A professional is someone whose wife works to enable him to paint.” Paul McCartney said that he and John Lennon used to sit down before a Beatles songwriting session and say, “Now, let’s write a swimming pool.” Pass around the hat. Turn your audience into patrons. Put a little virtual tip jar or a donate now button on your website. Keep a mailing list. They might not open it, but they definitely has to go to the trouble of deleting it. Make more work for yourself. Be ambitious. Keep yourself busy. Think bigger. Expand your audience. Don’t hobble yourself in the name of “keeping it real”, or “not selling out.” Try new things. “We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.” — Walt Disney. Pay it forward. “The biggest problem of success is that the world conspires to stop you doing the things that you do, because you are successful,” writes author Neil Gaiman. “There was a day when I looked up and realized that I had become someone who professionally replied to email, and who wrote as a hobby. I started answering fewer emails, and was relieved to find I was writing much more.” Be as generous as you can, but selfish to get your work done. Don’t quit your show. “Work is never finished, only abandoned.” — Paul Valéry. Just keep going. Every day, without hope or despair. Chain-smoke. Persevere, regardless of success or failure. Author Ernest Hemingway would stop in the middle of a sentence at the end of his day’s work so he knew where to start in the morning. Go away so you can come back. What are you hoping to express if all you see is four walls? Flee the office. To pick up a signal, cut off mobile service. Don’t die. Simply disappear a while. Take a sabbatical from your work if possible, or else use the time with commute, exercise, or nature to disengage from the world, and to engage with yourself. Start Over. Begin Again. “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough.” — Alain de Botton. Think of it as beginning again, instead of starting over. Go back to chapter one—literally!—and become an amateur."

Show Your Work is very simply written, using bold statements, art/poetry, quotes, and hand-drawn charts to elaborate on the author’s ideas. I appreciated Kleon’s bare bones style of writing; for this subject matter it really helps to get the point across simply and makes what he is saying memorable. The main subject of the book is to get your work out there, and learn new and effective ways of self-promotion for your artwork. I have found other self-promotion or marketing books to be more complicated or difficult to translate to the business side of being creative. Show Your Work takes take the complication away and makes the subject matter instantly relate-able. From my own past experience, self-promotion has seemed intimidating, but the straight-forward way Kleon presents his material can help motivate even the meekest self-promoter! He recommends beginning the process of sharing by first documenting each day what you do at different stages of your process. After compiling this daily log that you create for yourself, you can choose what would be most interesting and valuable to share with others via your blog, e-newsletter, or social media outlet.

I found it rather difficult to relate to most of it, but for anyone who has an interest in entrepreneurship, business, creativity, or the arts of any sort, this may be a helpful guide to kickstart your journey."

And it's really worth that good review. It's like a guideline on how to share your work as an artist. What to share and what u should not share. How to benefit from social media and internet as an artist in building your name. Care about the quality of your audience not their numbers and how to be close to them, and many many other useful advices I'm really grateful for my brother as it's his gift for me from his short trip to Dubai 💚 One thing that I don't like is that the papers fall out while reading 😟 . I recommend it to everyone represent his work through social media"

His books are very popular within the young creatives. In general, His writings take the form of top 10 advises, with quotes that are inspiring and long lasting. As he mentioned in this book, the materials he writes about are derived and compiled from post on his blog. Actually, this is the reason I started this whole thing about writing and blogging, so thank you Austin. I picked it up recently, my first impression about the title was that to show your work in the digital age, such as Instagram and Facebook etc... and that the tips will be about how to present them to leave the maximum impact and land your dream job. Not quite right... It is more of an invitation to not be too secretive about what are you doing, and how that will actually make you produce better work and receive more constructive feedback. This is particularly true in my case, so I surely need to slowly embed his advices into my workflow (I already have!). In terms of writing style, this is an easy read, there are not as much magical words or mysterious terms than there needs to be. There's casualness in the language that gives you the feeling that you're talking to your older brother, telling you lessons of life about things that will make yours much easier. The first point is called ""you don't have to be a genius"", this can be achieved in a few ways, one of which to have a ""scenius"", which is comprised of a group of creatives thinking collectively to bring about the fruits of an idea, and ""ecology of talent"". In a nutshell, it encourages you to share your ideas with a group of highly talented people and accept their feedback in order for the idea to grow and flourish. This is made even easier with the existence of the internet, where many communities exist to share common interests and exchange ideas about topics they care about. Another idea that comes out strongly in this chapter is to ""be an amateur"" about it, to remove all previous knowledge and allow yourself to learn from the start, and also to allow yourself the chance to explore and make mistakes, thus benefiting more from the process. I have talked a little bit about the first point, I will list the remaining 9, but will keep the fun part of reading and learning for you: 1- You don't have to be a genius 2- Think Process, not product 3- Share something every day 4- Open up your cabinet of curiosities 5- Tell good stories 6- Teach what you know 7- Don't turn into a human spam 8- Learn to take a punch 9- Sell out 10- Stick around Even though I believe I am not the target audience for this book, but I found some things for me to learn from and embed into my workflow and as a habit. Also, I think this would make more sense when you read ""Steal Like an Artist"" before or after this as, even though the topics are a bit different, they compliment each other, ""Steal Like an Artist"" help you with creation of artwork, and ""Show Your Work"" gives you the tools to improve it."

This is a book about getting 'discovered', whatever that means. My main takeaways from the book are as follows. Art is not just the painting, it is the way of life that created the painting. Painting is both an adjective and a verb. Posting online allows you to cultivate a community ('scenius' as the author puts it, rather than lone genius). Sharing what you know is a good way to get out there. Chain smoke aka ride one achievement into the other. Always move to areas you haven't mastered. Be a sell out, that's the point. Meet the people you find online. Meet your tribe. Stay a fan. Don't get too swept up in your own accomplishments or yourself. Share the things you really love, the things you hide from the world. Criticism will happen, and what? Would recommend to creatives for the occasional pick-me-up. Second read: Didn't remember I read this book the first time, which perhaps says something about my relationship with the concept of other people viewing my work. Takeaways not already noted include documenting process and focusing on it rather than process. Remain a beginner and don't be afraid to toss things out and start from scratch. Navigate towards what you want and not necessarily towards money. Give people a way to find you."

I liked it! It has a lot of concepts, advice, that if you work or study on a creative career or creative environment you've probably heard some of those before, but once in a while we need a reminder. We need to be reminded not to be too harsh on ourselves and from time to time step away and look at the work you've done, how far you've come, it also applies for entrepreneurs. The difficulty in every creative field it's the fact that we basically fill a space with something that it wasn't there before, we have to ""create"" stuff out of nowhere, and that sometimes it's a very difficult task, we put so much pressure into ourselves and this books tells you basically ""hey, give yourself a break, you don't have to show the world a masterpiece, you can show a little step of the road that eventually will take you to creating that masterpiece. And it is ok"" I recommend this book to anyone who has the wonderful task of creating something, ANYTHING."

On one hand, it can be truly motivational and resonates with me on a personal level in many aspects. However, viewing it from a purely utilitarian, non-fiction perspective, it falls a bit short. It reads more like a collection of blog posts on a personal website or Medium rather than a cohesive book. Perhaps this is a reflection of the increasing quality of tech and design writers on the web, which I hope is the case. I've noticed an overreliance on quotes and callbacks to stories from famous individuals, filling the chapters without the author providing much of his own opinion or additional insights. While some might see this as a clever approach, for me, it reinforces what I can't shake off about this book—it comes off as somewhat lazy. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking or extraordinary here. However, the writer keeps to his roots and beliefs. After all, he did write the book ""Steal like an Artist""..."

In ""Show Your Work,"" Austin Kleon tells us exactly that - how we can show our work so it has the impact we want and leaves as much of an impression on our audience as possible. Primarily, the book is for writers and creators - people who need to put out content every once in a while to stay relevant in the world of ever-changing social media algorithms. But aside from that, this book is also for every ambitious person who has struggled to show their work to the world and are constantly in stealth mode. The 10 essays in the book are designed to help you let go of your insecurities, find a constant publishing pattern that works for you, and establish a niche for yourself in today's digital world."

However, social media just does not come easy to me. I hate the feeling of needing to be saying something all the time. The gargantuan amount of work it takes to plan, script, film, edit and post content multiple times a week is also incredibly unappealing to me. One of the reasons I probably gravitated towards music as a profession is so that I can communicate through it, instead of with words, which I often fumble. Despite all of that, a goal of mine this year IS to post more often about my work as I realize that, as the author puts it, “It sounds a little extreme, but in this day and age, if your work isn't online, it doesn't exist.” I picked up this book to help motivate me on this and to get some insight into how best to go about it. Show Your Work! By Austin Kleon is a tiny book. It is tiny in terms of its physical size (think the size of a CD case) and tiny in terms of the amount of words. It has big margins and big font. There are illustrations, pictures or quotes that take up entire pages. I was worried that there wouldn’t be much juice here due to that. The author even says at one point “A lot of the ideas in this book started out as tweets, which then became blog posts, which then became book chapters.” It definitely comes across that way. The other side of the coin though is that a result of this style is that every sentence is very concise and thought out. There are no wasted words. It feels fine tuned which is nice. With all of the above being said, there are a lot of small gems here that really resonated with me. Other reviewers have mentioned the overreliance on quotes and stories from famous individuals filing the chapters without the author providing much of their own insights. I can see that and I can also see that, if you’re researching this topic all over the internet, there might not be much new here. But for me, at this moment when I need this kind of motivation, a lot of things resonated. If you’re in a similar situation where you do creative and/or freelance work and are stressed about the need to constantly put your work and yourself out online, I would recommend this book as a starting place to help you hone in some motivation and some initial ideas on how to start structuring your content."

The amount of impact is indescribable! The book is divided into ten chapters, in each chapter the writer laid out amazing lessons in form of personal stories, quotes from writers and creatives, interviews, or even books. In my opinion, Show your work is one of the most important books that need to be read by influencers, creatives, entrepreneurs, students, teachers, or basically anyone cause it gives such a deep insight into the importance of not only sharing your work and putting yourself out there but also the process of doing so and the importance of accepting the failure, and learning how to accept criticism.

I have got here because Chris Do of YouTube recommended it. This book has a few good ideas, but it's a scam. It's a short, itemized, blog post blown up into book size. So if you are passing a shelf with this book on it, just bother to read the table of contents. That is all. The rest is cute useless inspirational quotes and a lot of filler and a few ugly doodles. And the worst part are the guy's thoughts. Virtue signaling and crap. He starts somewhere among the first pages ""I hate talking about self-promotion."" So much he wrote a whole book about it. And than sprinkle references to other works of his. Or ""Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public."" Strange. So far I have never met an amateur that was not self conscious. Most of them go even further and need expensive gear just to show their dedication to this worthy cause. Or ""The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it's turning us all into amateurs."" Right. Because of this when you can do something on a computer in 15 minutes, conference rooms will be filled to the brim with people that have come to listen to some has been about ""back in my days, we used to do that in 2 months"".

The idea that just sharing whatever it is you're already working on, rather than waiting for a 'finished end product' before showing it to the world, was new to me, but seems rather straightforward in retrospect. (consider for instance the popularity of ""a day in the life"" styled videos on youtube or productivity channels) However, it seems a little unrealistic to expect every person who reads this book is going to trailblaze a path online, and have it lead to positive consequences in the offline world as well. New ideas and great products/services are still important, and all the marketing can't change that. The mathematics of the internet creation:consumption ratio, or traffic monopolies also don't support such a notion. (Eg:-about 90% of youtube traffic is directed towards 3% of the channels) I suppose the take-home notion is to stop worrying and enjoy the process. To quote the author, ""Don't worry for now, how you'll make money or a career of it. Forget about being a expert or professional, and wear your amateurism (your heart/love) on your sleeve. Share what you love and the people who love the same things will find you."" Expect there's a good chance they won't find you, and you should still share what you love anyway."

It doesn't exactly talk about socials (though that is a big part of it!) it was a good read in relation to how I approach sharing my writing. It encouraged me, too, to keep going with the ""writing journal"" and document the progress of each day."

Even as an analyst, I have a page-worth of takeaways. Also, Austin lives in Austin so he mentioned Franklin's BBQ being one of the most famous BBQ joints in the world. I didn't know it was that popular but it deserves all the recognition since that food slaps."

This is a weird genre of self-help/feel-good books for people doing creative work. While it is in a fact list of 10 ways to share your creativity, the goal of the book is to inspire and help you unstuck. It's super tiny and it would either talk to your soul, or you would find it utterly useless."

A quick read, some helpful tips. I guess I prefer his other book, “Keep Going.” Advice for learning ""how to take a punch: Relax and breathe: Take a deep breathe and accept what comes Strengthen your neck: The more criticism you are able to handle, the more you realize it cannot hurt you Roll with the punches: You cannot control ""what"" you receive, however, you can control ""how"" you respond Protect your vulnerable areas: By avoiding being vulnerable, you will never truly connect with others Keep your balance: Your work is ""something you do"" and not ""who you are."""

I like the conversational style and technically adore the quotes, anecdotes and artist recommendations in Kleon's books. But I feel that there are quite some people, I wish ... he'd just not quote or used as an example (Polanski is a big one, but also Louis C.K.) There's just so many other great people you could have rather cited than these ones. The ""lessons"" or suggestions in here are neat though, and I do like the little hand-drawn titles and mindmaps throughout the book, they're a nice touch."

A pick-me-up nudge that tips your motivation riiight over the edge into action. I also took snapshots of a few passages that felt particularly useful to me. The issue is that it's too short to get into much at all. But mostly, I don't appreciate when books are packed with quotes--David Brooks tends to do this--because they lack substance and a common thread other than, well, a bunch of quotes about a general topic. I would have liked to learn more about Austin Kleon's personal journey and how he has grappled with his ten pieces of advice during his career."

Shut up and listen once in a while.” “Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff.” “If you never go to work, you never get to leave work.” I think this summarizes my main takeaways from the book.
