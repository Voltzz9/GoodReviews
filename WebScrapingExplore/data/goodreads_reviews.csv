Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is based on a television series which can be viewed on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfB-p... This is a really remarkable series and a remarkable, although annoying, book. The book is annoying because it should have been a coffee table book with large colour photographs and large font – instead it is a Penguin paperback with a font tending towards the unreadable and grey scale reproductions of the paintings that make them almost impossible to view. This is agonising, as really all you will want to do is studying and think about these images for hours. There is something we sort of know, even if I suspect we are completely wrong in our intuition. We have been, as humans, looking at pictures for a lot longer than we have been reading books. For the vast majority of us, literacy is a disturbingly recent invention – perhaps a hundred , maybe a hundred and fifty years for people in the first world. Churches told their Biblical stories as much in images as in words. For a long time even here the words were spoken in a language that was not understood by those listening. Learning how to read images, something so many of us assume isn’t something we need to learn, but rather is somehow immediate, takes an entire culture and also takes perhaps as long as to learn how to read. To understand how images work on us – how we are manipulated by them – that takes at least as long as it takes to learn the same things about how words work on and manipulate us. So, on one level this book is an exploration of the history of oil painting and what such paintings ‘mean’ – mean to us now in comparison to what they meant to earlier generations of people in Western societies. Because the Western tradition of painting is quite a separate thing from any other ‘world art’ traditions. He starts by saying that paintings are both still and silent. This is an interesting thing to say, because how we generally experience paintings today – or at least, learn about them – is through shows like Sister Wendy’s World Tour of Art or Simon Schama’s Power of Art. Don’t for a second get me wrong here – I loved both. But the art works displayed are anything but still or silent. There is a voice track and there is a panning and a zooming-in that turns these still and silent works into something approaching a cartoon. I had never considered the implications of this before. The painting stops being what it is, in fact, cannot remain what it is on the screen, it stops being an object that the artist created so as to speak for itself, and now requires someone to mediate between it and us, to either speak over it (explain it) or to orchestrate it (quite literally, with music) so that we are taught the proper way to read this painting. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we ‘read’ paintings and images, particularly after reading a book called Reading Images: the grammar of visual design. It is interesting that in that book it is clear that linguistic grammar has been used as a way to structure our response to the grammar of images – quite effectively, I think – but this is almost counter-intuitive. If we have had a more immediate relationship with images than with written text, why is it that we need to use the organising principles associated with written texts so as to seek to understand images? Why doesn’t that work the other way around? I know in part this is because language has been formally codified, but this, again, raises the question of why images are so resistant to such codification. Why would it be daft to explain what a verb is by reference to Mona Lisa’s eyebrows? The relationship between being naked (being without clothes) and being nude is presented here in what I take to be feminist art criticism. A nude is not merely someone without clothes – it is almost invariably a female and she is also on display, an object. In many ways she is not really the protagonist of the painting, even when she is the only person in the painting – the other person that is always present is the anonymous male viewer towards whom she is on display. He shows image after image of nude women, and even while being embraced, they are turned to the viewer, turned to their true lover, their fantasy lover, for not only are they the screen on which we project our lust, but also the reason for our weaknesses – they are, in the end, to be lusted over and to blame. No wonder they are invariably passive and languid. After corrupting the whole of male humanity, how could they not look exhausted? And that is actually the point – it is only today that a painting can be seen by quite so many people. They were never intended to be seen other than by the very few. Today paintings are pretty much what Plato said of them, representations of representations – but as such they are a demonstration of just how wealthy the owner really was. Paintings put on display the wealth of their owners – and that was a large part of what had been their purpose. Here’s me, and here’s the missus, and we are standing in front of our house, this is our bedroom, these are the oranges we have shipped in from Spain, this is our cow and, despite the late summer sun setting, these are our furs. The last program in the series looks at advertising and how it uses and distorts the language of paintings, to which it is the last dying breathe of a tradition spanning back 500 years. In oil painting we are looking at the current wealth of the owners – there is a now-ness about these paintings – this is what I look like now, this is what I own now – the fact that it is always ‘then’ in images is something everyone has become more aware of now we have cameras and something Barthes explains beautifully in his Camera Lucida. Time stops in the image, and as such all images are images of death. Life immediately marches away from them, leaving them as pure memory. So, paintings are always about the present and, as such, thus also immediately about the past – the present being just the past in waiting. But marketing images are always about the future, never about the present. Selling something is about creating a desire and that desire is not here and now, it is sometime soon. In many ways advertising doesn’t sell products – it sells envy and desire. As he points out, the rich people in oil paintings are not glamorous – glamour is beside the point. To be glamorous the viewer needs to want to emulate the people they see in the images – but the people who own paintings see themselves – so, there is no need for glamour. To sell product you need to sell a fantasy and that fantasy needs to be just out of reach, but obtainable though an exchange not actually part of the image, an exchange of money for a good, but that exchange is the point of the image. That capitalism needs such constant exchanges and that advertising creates the desires that fuel these exchanges is the open secret of our society. That said, I’d never considered the relationship with time that this creates before – how, to be economically valid units, we need to be constantly living in a fantasy future, while also being prepared to put up with just about any boredom in our all too prosaic present. No wonder advertisement is uninterested in now, it needs to be – it needs to negate now for what is to come. The book also draws a distinction between how we advertise to the working class (the promised transformation is based on Cinderella) and the middle class (the promised transformation is based on The Enchanted Palace) – for the working class buying this one product will be enough to transform you into the princess, for the middleclass investing in this bank will bring you all of the good things in life, which are, of necessity, an ensemble. There is so much to think about in this tiny book and this short series of films. I watch shows like this and I think, imagine what television could have been – but, of course, it could never have been anything of the kind. This is very much the exception that proves the rule. So, to see what television could never have been allowed to be, watch this and then go back to reading books."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I am not the audience for this book, mainly because I've already read and more or less digested the handful of essays and ideas on which it is based. The seven chapters break down fairly simply. 1: Benjamin's 'Work of Art'--the ability to reproduce images alters the way we encounter works of art. This seems reasonable. Nobody gets to see a Giotto without having seen a reproduction first, except someone who has no interest in the Giotto in the first place. But Berger et al* go a step further: we need to use the fact that we encounter works of art differently to undermine the ruling class's privilege and the ""specialized experts who are the clerks of the nostalgia of a ruling class in decline."" That's on page 32. Part of me, a large part, laments the fact that you'd never get that published today, not even on a website. Another part of me laments the stupidity of intellectuals who put their faith in the inherent goodness of The People. The People does not have a good track record when it comes to art appreciation. That's not to say that people can't learn to appreciate art, only that We are no better and no worse than the ruling class was. We need to learn, we need to be taught, you can't do that if you assume that We are inherently able to do the right thing. 2 & 3: Women are depicted differently from men, and, frankly, not in ways that are healthy for anyone, but particularly not for women. I agree. Which makes it breathtaking to see the authors get so many things wrong, either intentionally (cutting short the bible verse in which God punishes Eve *and Adam*); stupidly (non-Western art forms show women as active participants in sex, so that are isn't morally dubious); or in ways that are, ahem, temporally bound (""Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion."" Seventies!). 5: Oil paintings are bourgeois and generally not morally okay. Holbein's 'Ambassadors' is read as an example of this; the incredible distorted skull in the painting is the exception which proves the rule of oil paintings rather than, you know, showing that oil paintings can be self-critical, as are most good artworks of any kind. In general, the lesson of this book is that all art is bad for you, except the pieces that the authors of this book like. They like pieces by artists who can plausibly be turned into radicals, because only radicals can be interesting (Franz Hals; William Blake). They don't discuss the 20th century at all (I know they know that twentieth century art exists; perhaps, as good Benjaminian Marxists, they don't like abstraction or difficulty). They're also very uncomfortable with religious art, and want to group, e.g., Ambrosius Benson's Mary Magdalene with the absurd and/or pornographic Magdalene of later times, rather than admitting the rather obvious differences (Benson's is rich, but not, how can I put this... naked and disheveled.) Since the authors have a hard time saying what they actually like (vs. what they suspect is oppressive), you get idiocies like this: Rembrandt's famous late portrait shows a man for whom ""all has gone except a sense of the question of existence, of existence as a question."" A little thought would show that this is the sort of conservative pablum Great Artists have been serving up for generations. 6 & 7: Advertizing uses art to make you think you want things you don't want and that you can get them, so you don't need to think about what you really want, e.g., more time away from the office. This is true. In sum: I was sucked in by the idea that this was a book about understanding art. It is not. It is critical theory for high-school readers. Good for what it is, but extremely narrow in scope, and quite harmful for anyone who swallows it whole rather than taking a few minutes to worry away at its assumptions. Harmful because those who accept it will say silly things, and because those who read it and reject it out of hand (due to the rhetoric, bad arguments, or conceptual confusion) won't be challenged to, you know, care about other people. * Humorous aspect of this book: it makes a big deal about how it was written by a group of people, because, you know, individuals are bad, and groups are good. You'll note that the book is sold as a book by John Berger. You can draw the conclusion."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"First of all, this entire book is set in bold. I don't know what crazy crazyman let that through the gate at Penguin but I just felt I had to point it out right away. It's still worth reading. 4 essays and 3 pictorial essays. Really interesting stuff cutting away some of the bullshit associated with our appreciation of art. It seems like museums are doing a lot of things wrong as well as right. Chapter on oil-painting was particularly interesting but it was the last one about advertising (or ""publicity"" as it's exclusively referred to in this book) that has me thinking. Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it's thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that's grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This was a great introduction to the work of John Berger, and my doubts that this would turn into something rather dull were swiftly blown away. His approach to art isn't overly complex thus you don't have to be a cultural boffin on the subject, yet its deep on a theoretical level to challenge and stimulate the old grey matter. Ways of Seeing offers not just an idea but also an invitation to see and know the world differently. As the TV series aired in 1972 (four years before I was born) I will likely turn to youtube and try to catch an episode or two, and hopefully find it as fascinating as this book. Bravo John!"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Almost laughably disappointing. Berger obviously has the best of intentions, but his analysis is amateurish at best, pathetically reactionary (almost to the point of seeming to whine) at worst, and largely cribbed from thinkers of far greater intellectual originality and power than himself. For starters, he seems either ignorant of or unwilling to admit that what we broadly call 'mainstream visual art' is, was, and quite likely almost always has been directly tied up with wealth; with commissions, patronage, really with human commerce itself. Visual art isn't some pure, 'virginal' endeavor sullied by capitalism. Visual art is a creative activity which is intimately tied into and dependent on capitalism (really, on wealth) in the first place... and with displaying and re-affirming that wealth. His naive disgust with modern capitalism's collusion with art assumes that there was some magical time when art existed in a vacuum of economic/ideological purity, unsullied by the lucre of having to actually pay someone to produce a canvas or carve a church door or gild something. If such 'pure' art even exists in the first place, Berger provides literally no evidence for it: no examples from non-western European, 'traditional' cultures or even folk arts which might conceivably hint that some people make art for nothing more than their own personal pleasure. As if his shallow reading of these issues wasn't bad enough, he then goes on to make the utterly ludicrous claim that portraits of women, nudes, etc, show us that all women everywhere (and only ever women) are essentially shaped (really, he means warped) by the erotic gaze of male longing and domination. That's a powerful idea. It's also utterly indemonstrable and reeks of cheap psycho-analysis. Worse than that...it's a theory concocted to explain and reduce the female experience, which to be sure, has been cruelly unfair for the vast majority of human history, down into a narrow category of sexual expectation. Has John Berger ever MET an actual woman? What could be more bigoted, what could be more misogynistic, than dismissively generalizing all members of the female sex as simply 'damaged' by the male gaze, as if a single tiny statement was enough to claim to understand the full totality of the female experience and female suffering through out history? And of course, his visual examples of this are, again, cheaply cherry picked...just a few nudes (which to be sure, are pathetically offensive). Berger manages the odd feat of trying to empathize with the female subject in art and somehow making himself come across as an arrogant misogynist in the process. The problem with this book is that underneath it's crummy pseudo-analysis is a person who already knows how the world is to such a level of satisfaction that he has nothing left to discover or even really demonstrate about it. Capitalism? Oh it's ruined art. (Never mind telling us about what art from a non-capitalist culture is like) Women? Oh the poor things, they're so warped by male expectations its a miracle they can even stand up (Never mind that you don't relate any actual woman's experience at any point). Photography? Oh that's ruined art too by making images ubiquitous (never mind really examining photography fairly to see the myriad ways it has changed modern culture and modern art) This book proves one thing above all: the complacent intellectual smugness of the person who wrote it. Look, the relationship between the commercial world and the ever-changing world of visual artistic endeavor is a hugely diverse and complicated subject, as is the relationship between art and advertising. As is, especially, the relationship between gender roles and visual art through out history. Thinkers as diverse as Susan Sontag, Walter Benjamin, Virginia Woolf, Naomi Klein, etc. have all written elegantly and movingly about these topics. John Berger's ""Ways of Seeing"" tries to stand on the shoulders of such thinkers and falls off on nearly every page. Largely because the only thing Berger seems to 'see' is his own self-satisfaction."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Interesting little book. The author’s matter-of-factness annoyed me at times and I had the sense that he kept looking for the worst in the human nature of artists, art owners and consumers alike. If nothing else, he gives us food for thought. I enjoyed the essay on publicity images the most. For what it’s worth, I couldn’t help comparing Berger’s view that to that of Don Draper’s, leading character and quintessential ad-man of Madmen, as is expressed on the Netflix trailer: I agree with both but the latter is kinder."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"On the top floor in the Strand Bookstore in New York, I saw a self-consciously bored worker show a struggling-to-be-bored kid with his mom to the art table. The worker was like ""well, you need this, and this, and this"" and I realized the kid must be in art school and the worker must have graduated pretty recently. The worker was like ""have you read Ways of Seeing? By John Berger?"" and wanted to have geeky enthusiasm, but kept her eyes half closed and only lifted the book two inches. The kid was like ""no, what is that?"" and trying not to care. The worker was like, totally monotone, ""well, it's really amazing. You'll have to read that. Everyone reads it. Anyway, it's awesome."" Then they went away and I picked it up, because I would like to go to art school, learn 1,000 techniques and become spiritually fulfilled, kind, married, a terrific cook, and understand flowers etc. and make informative life-affirming web shorts that are not irrelevant. In the bookstore, Ways of Seeing was boring but I decided it was my fault. Months later, I found it in a library in Santa Cruz, California. It is printed in bold type for no reason. I guess it is interesting. Oil paintings were about conspicuous consumption back in the day. Only women are conscious about what they present to the world looks-wise. Fetishizing the past helps aristocrats stay aristocrats. Capitalists turned art into a commodity. This is apparently all pulled from a BBC special which I bet is more interesting. At a certain point in your life this will BLOW YOUR MIND, but if you know in your heart that one day we will all hate stainless steel kitchens and be like ""ugh, so old fashioned, barf"" you will probably be like ""yeah, this was okay."""

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"John Berger’s Ways of Seeing, based on a four-part 1972 BBC documentary series of the same name, is considered one of the most influential and accessible works of writing about art in the English language — and rightly so. Consisting of four textual essays and three picture essays bereft of text, this book deconstructs the dominant cultural ‘gaze’ towards art and connects it with the way we regard and ascribe meaning, both to works of art and to the world around us. Particularly insightful, even path-breaking, is the essay on the tradition of the Nude and how it relates to the power (and gender) dynamics between the surveyed and the surveyor. It is here that Berger illustrates the social existence of men as subjects and women as objects: The distinction created here between nakedness and nudity is also notable: One of the most important tasks performed in is that it democratises art and meaning-making, freeing it from the mystification of the art-critic and the exclusive enjoyment of the status-quo (a function also performed, albeit differently, by the invention of camera and the possibility of reproduction – both ideas dealt with in the first essay in this volume). I also found the essay on the Publicity Image and Advertising to be a particularly important theoretical intervention, revealing publicity as both a tradition of continuity and a break from the oil painting as a methodical construction of a new aspirational way of seeing (while seeing the same things: prosperity and happiness), situating envy and glamour as its centerpiece. Despite being written in the 1970s, continues to be a thoroughly important and relevant read, well into the second decade of the 21st century. I would, however, advise a word of caution with regards to its eurocentrism (and certain incorrect notions about art in the East, especially with regards women and sexuality) in some places. Given that one of the chief aims of this book is to demystify and democratise art appreciation, it makes sense that this book appears as a paperback instead of the more thematically-appropriate coffee-table format. However, what makes no sense whatsoever is that the entire book is set in a headache-inducing bold sans-serif font. My second reading of this book was from an e-copy, but the typeset was still bold and only marginally less annoying. Moreover, I’m glad that I read this in an age when paintings can be looked up on the internet, because the miniature black-and-white reproductions printed in the book are barely decipherable, let alone offering a chance for the kind of assessment this book recommends. The Penguin paperback edition of is paradoxically at odds with the book’s intrinstic argument for accessibility; a visual iteration of the value-divide between authors and publishers if you will."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice."" An indispensable starting point for anyone who wants to think deeply about visual art, its meanings, and its uses in the (post)industrial age. If you're an art lover like I am (my ""art"" tag on a certain largely-defunct blogging platform runs to something like 1,300 images, for an account I started less than two years ago) is both troubling and extremely enriching. Troubling because it's impossible not to feel uneasy once you start acknowledging the commodity status which is inherent to virtually all ""high"" art produced in the age of capitalism, whether it be an oil painting commissioned by a successful merchant in 1671 to gratify his vanity and affirm his perception of the world, or a more contemporary piece fated to become a sort of monetary storage unit for the obscenely wealthy, regardless of the artist's intent or the conditions in which it was created. (Though Berger is more concerned with older works in this short book.) Troubling also because of the ease with which artistic iconography can be used to mold subconscious perceptions, to enforce entrenched attitudes and prejudices, and to lend authority to advertisements and propaganda. (For instance, there's an excellent and much-quoted essay here on the patriarchal function of ""the nude"" in western art.) Yet enriching because—well, to start with, it's always good to be attuned to the realities of the world one lives in, unpleasant or not. But also because Berger himself is not a Hater of Art or anything ridiculous like that: he simply wants us to be smarter about the way we engage with images, to internalize the notion that works are shaped by the context in which they are created and viewed, and to start to be able to pick out what is truly innovative or inspired or subversive in the visual arts by way of a contrast with what is hackneyed, safe, or insidious. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the book's origins as a TV special, Berger is about as clear and direct a prose stylist as can be imagined, and provides some great illustratory images if you can find a copy that doesn't shrink and drain them of color. (I highly recommend reading the book , where the pics are large and vibrant.) Actually, about half the essays are entirely pictorial, chains and collages of images which we are invited to fill in with our own interpretations and associations. The whole thing could be grasped by a teenager and read in an afternoon, which is not to say that it's rudimentary or unserious. It's definitely not. I've been depressed lately by discussions I've run into online about art and ideology, particularly regarding ""modern"" (i.e. abstract expressionist) works: conversations which, like so much web discourse, tend to drain the topic of all nuance and complexity in the rush to arrive at the most ""correct"" and politically defensible position. The advent of NFTs and the emergence of art-generating AI software are also spurring plenty of fervent discussion across the web; in other words, the nature and ethics of visual art are very far from settled issues. Though Berger himself sticks mostly to the block of centuries post-Renaissance and pre-photography, it was refreshing to be reminded of how good these kinds of conversations be, when facilitated by someone who knows what they're talking about and wants to encourage thoughtful examination rather than algorithmic engagement. If for my own part I've been vague about what he actually has to , it's only because I'd rather not summarize such an already-concise and graspable work. Please read it if you can. As for me, I think it's time to dig into some ."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"“There is more than meets the eye” I recently reread Kenneth Clark's Civilization. It was based on a British documentary TV series, from the end of the 1960s. In it Clark offers a very own, but still fairly classic introduction to art. The book of John Berger (1926-2017) and the accompanying TV-series (look it up on You Tube!) was released in 1972 and was the antipode of Clark’s. Berger looked at the works of art very differently, or more correctly: he looked at the way we ""see"" very differently. To start with, he makes the reader-viewer aware of the world behind the artworks, the social context in which they came about. It is an exquisite analysis that he borrows from philosopher Walter Benjamin. Knowing that the 17th-century Dutch painter Frans Hals, for example, lived in bitter poverty when he painted group portraits of well-off citizens, does indeed make you look at those works of art very differently. With this other approach, Berger knocked down quite some sacred houses, especially those of traditional art critics and their emphasis on the creative genius and timelessness of works of art. He was forcefully criticized for it, but it must be said that he himself did not shy away from sharp polemics, also in this booklet. But Berger offers more: he also shows that ‘seeing’ happens in a specific, social context. His analysis of how women take into account how they are viewed (especially by men) is particularly lucid and unfortunately still topical. The way in which publicity influences and manipulates our visual language is also aptly articulated and represented. Berger also demonstrates the enormous impact of new techniques (reprography and the camera in Berger's time), making artworks available permanently and everywhere, regardless of their context, and therefore they are seen in a different way than before. I can imagine that 50 years ago this little book was a real eye-opener (pun intended). Nevertheless, during the reading, the impression came to me that the work is not really fresh anymore. Perhaps that is because a number of his views have since become commonplace. Perhaps it is also due to the layout of the booklet, with small black-and-white illustrations. But probably it’s Berger's rather classic marxist discourse that makes it seem a bit outdated: using words such as ""capitalist exploitation of the masses"", ""deprivation"" and ""proletariat"" now, in the 21st century, seems quite dated and even touching.

It is composed of seven essys, four use words and images, three only images. It discusses how women are view in society with an emphasis and concentration on European or Western culture. The images are from ads and famous European paintings. Being that I work in a museum and see paintings all day long this aspect interests me in particular. Basically the book is saying that in our European based culture women are objects, men are subjects. Men survey, women are surveyed. Since women are always on display in our society, they adjust their behaviour in order to please and fit in with our male dominated society. I reference this book many times in my own personal writings. What Mr. Berger has written still has value today. Actually in many ways not much has changed for women. We in the USA and Western Europe are a little better off because we can work, make money and have legal rights but that is not true for women in the rest of the world. Living in a Democratic or secular society does give women more control over their lives as opposed to dictatorships and theocracies. However even in the United States our actions as women and men are based on social constructs and society's defintions of how men and women should behave towards each other. Even how women view and interact with each other to the point that women are very competitive, jealous and vindictive in order to get or keep a man. But that is another story for discussion in the essays I have written."

The theories presented are very interesting and are posed with pictorial references that do very well to prove points. One interesting chapter deals exclusively with the 'Nude' in art overtime. Overtime it has been reviled, reveared, copied, censored, hidden, hoarded and abstracted. Another great chapter deals in the context in which people see art, in contrast to how they might have been meant to see it by the artist. Many pieces are painted as singular wall decorations, but now are hanging in museums next to a hundred other of these decorations. Overtime people now view art online or in sections of video, where a director controls the viewers eyes as what to see through camera tricks and narration. The chapter contemplates and guesses how this might change to experience of art over time. Changing from entertainment, to a more scholarly subject. A very interesting read."

Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.” The first essay concerns how much a person's perspective is subject to change based on their surroundings and how the reproduction of art (alias photography) has negatively impacted the collective art-viewing experience. One can easily draw a parallel between this experience and the movie-going experience: how watching a movie amongst an audience is vastly different from watching it at your leisure on your couch. The essay also criticizes the imposing and more-often-than-not pseudo-intellectual culture of over-analysis of paintings. The irony, however, lies in the fact that Berger, while not empathetic with indulgent criticism, most of the time scribes down his thoughts with a definitive, autocratic tonality. The second essay talks about the male gaze. In doing so, the tone often trod the fine line between factual and sexist, but in the end, succeeded in convincing us that the author only wanted to say that it is the way it is. Nudist craft has, for decades, been invariably about the female body and hence, has remained more about objectification than anything else. The third one addresses the capitalist mentality from the 15th and 16th centuries regarding oil painting and how art regressed into merely a byproduct of consumerism. The last one retains as a continuation of that and addresses publicity and talks more in-depth about consumerist psychology, how it is a ramification of envy rather than greed. The prose is rather grandiose and, as I felt, often indulgent. It shows more than it tells (no pun intended), and while it is evident that Berger's knowledge of Western art and culture is quite astute, his text remains woefully ignorant of Orientalist art. There are maybe a couple of mentions thrown here and there, and while there's nothing wrong with a book being only about Western art, there's something definitely wrong with generalizing based on that. Also, this should've been a coffee table book. of"

I got this as a present today, and have spent the day, on and off, reading it (between cake and beer and garden sunshine). This is usually regarded as the 'most influential' book on art ever, or at least one of them. Berger writes in a clean, no-nonsense kind of way. Despite discussing nudity in art, or the history of art, or discussing the paintings printed in the book, it's never hard to follow. I suppose someone with even no background interest in art could read it without any trouble. That being said, without any interest in art, I'd say this book wouldn't be for you. Though the book is 'Ways of Seeing' - that is very much in relation to art. A more suitable name may be 'Ways of Seeing '. Though, the final essay on capitalism/consumerism and publicity is very interesting, whatever your passions are. But, as for me, an art lover, I found this deeply insightful and fascinating. And Berger's writing was just an added bonus as he takes us on this short romp through art. There are many reproductions of art inside, and for some reason, the text is all bold. Not sure whose bright idea that was."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I admit I’m not well-versed in art history and theory, so that may be a reason this book affected me so deeply, but I was really struck by these essays. They’re incisive. They’re structured well. And they truly made me think. They made me think about art as a sign, a symbol, an argument, a brag, a promise, a prison. Berger is very clear about his purview here, which I appreciate. Though he mentions photography and advertising and film, and he draws contrasts to sculpture and Eastern art, the real subject of analysis is European oil paintings and, by extension, the rise of capitalism. There are both visual and written essays, and while I was initially wary about how well an essay told only through images would work, I was quickly won over. My favourite written essays were about representations of women and nudity—touching on appearance, agency, sight, maleness as the norm—and the final essay on advertising, which Berger refers to as “publicity”—touching upon classism, envy, glamour, desire, materialism, and commodification. Comparatively, my problems are rather slight. The book is set entirely in bold, which is weird. The cover is hideous; whose idea was it to just paste the first few paragraphs of the essay right onto the cover?! The images are in tiny and black and white and in some of the visual essays they run across the crease of the spine, rendering them nearly indiscernible. But I think my only criticism of the content itself is that Berger has a tendency to make some pretty definitive declarations, especially about what is and is not “exceptional.” Take this statement from p. 103: “Adriaen Brouwer was the only exceptional ‘genre’ painter.” Hmmm. Berger backs this statement up, of course, and explains why Brouwer was different from his contemporaries, but that doesn’t make it any more than an opinion presented as a fact, which rubs me the wrong way. The best thing I can say about a collection of essays is that it changed my way of thinking—my way of seeing!—and that is undoubtedly true with this book. There are layers to art criticism that never crossed my mind, layers far beyond and beneath the purely aesthetic, and I’ll be thinking about these things next time I visit an art museum. I’ll be asking questions like: who was this painted for? Who and what are the subjects? How are the people looking at me, the observer, and how are they arranged to appeal to or challenge my point of view? What sort of place would this have been hung in before it was brought to this museum? And who would have been looking at it there? And what would they have hoped to show to people who visited their home or abbey or office, to make them feel? More often than not, according to Berger, the answer to the last question is envy."

Link to the documentary (which I definitely recommend you watch to supplement the reading of the text): Will add my proper in-depth review of this later (as it really does deserve one). For now, I will just say that Berger makes us think: he makes us think about the impact of images, their history, their place in society and their role in furthering capitalist agendas. He makes us think about the image of women, the role they play in the system, the condition of modern galleries and museums, and most importantly, Berger makes us think about the modern day photograph and what it means for as a functioning member of society - it's all very insightful and he demystifies art in a fashion which is simple to understand as far as theory goes. Very marxist in his views and vocabulary (which I know will bother some) but I enjoyed that part hah."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"All of what I picked up from this atrocity of a Book is that John Berger is a pretentious cunt. He hides behind the fact that he states he's ""demystifying"" art when in actuality he's giving you his opinion on the propaganda of art and how the artist doesn't exist. I must say first and foremost I am a huge believer in the auteur theory and author's/artist's purpose, so this is why I am opposed to this book. Berger is merely under the assumption that all art is just a way for the elite white male population to flaunt and reassure themselves that they are superior to the plebeians. I'm paraphrasing of course, but this book clearly undermines the intent of the artist. In this book Berger devalues the artist by saying that their creations are merely a tool for the elite to flaunt their wealth, as is expected from a contextualist. He only gives credit to the ""masters"" of the medium. Whom he states surpassed all the average form of art by going outside the boundaries of standard commissioned art (Such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, etc). Berger also has the problem of most contextualists, by which I mean he tries to find meaning or more accurately make up meaning whenever possible. One of the finest examples of this is when he described a simple livestock oil painting as, and I quote ""furniture with four legs in the eyes of the viewer that emphasizes the social status of their owners."" Which honestly might have some truth to it, but is more likely a showing of the owner's connection with nature or the artist's connection or attempt to bring together animals and people into the same composition. Essentially what I'm saying is that Berger's book might appeal to contextual art historians, feminists and socialists, but I feel it lacks any serious criticism or review on art as a whole. It is less of a book about how to see art and more a way to simplify art as a commodity for wealthy, sex-driven, elitist men."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I first read the book in 2000 as a young freshman in a class on Popular Culture and Ideology. I remember being overwhelmed by the wonderful insights of this book. Now, more than 20 years later, I can still appreciate the book, while at the same time being a bit more skeptical of its insights...and at the same time wondering if it can speak to the current moment in history. If I had to sum up the book in a few short sentences it would be this: Paintings and pictures are always for something and someone. Often, paintings and pictures express the desires of capital and the ruling class. When the artist does get a moment of triumph over the medium and its language of power, it is often a hard fought and meager one. Perhaps that short summary has done some lasting epistemic damage to the book and its meaning. After all, one of the lessons of critical works such as Berger's is that life, power, and imagery is never so simple. And yet, in my middle age years, I feel like I need critical and postmodern scholars to be less baroque in their insights and more modern. The short summary, the abstract, with all its obfuscating simplicity is needed in order to give a very ""modern"" sense of order to the world. At a time when conspiracy theories and epistemic anarchy is spreading, I wonder what John Berger would make of flat-earthers, climate change denialists, and other conspiracy theorist advocates. Are they the noble anti-establishment avant garde? I tried to find anything in this book that would speak to our unsettled times. I found brilliant insights but nothing that spoke to my own sense of unease specifically. For that reason, perhaps I enjoyed the picture essays the best this time around. Those chapters where the art and pictures were left without text to speak through me and let my anxieties and thoughts have free reign."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Here are some reductive summaries of the seven chapters in this book. Chapter 1: Art galleries are dumb, memes are the future. Chapter 2: Tits! Chapter 3: Men like looking at women, and pretending women are to blame for it. Chapter 4: Uh, art? I really don't know, there were runs of themes but nothing across everything. Chapter 5: Turns out they were all oil paintings. Apparently oil paintings are about owning things, where 'things' can be anything. Chapter 6: Different kinds of people. And horses. And dogs. No idea. Chapter 7: Adverts are a bit like oil paintings because they're about stuff. Okay, it might be apparent that I didn't really like this. Part of this is down to Berger's style, which seems to involve making weird and unsubstantiated claims, and then expanding airily on those claims. There are a bunch of points Berger does this in the text, but they are particularly galling when he does it with regard to the illustrations. Some examples: 1. : Berger instructs that we 'judge for yourself' about whether Hals painted some criticism of the Governesses. Well, I did, and I can't see anything to suggest that, and neither do I come away thinking that I 'know the personality traits and even habits' of the subjects, as both he and the author he quotes suggest I should. 2. : Berger says the two women have similar expressions. No, the one looks sleepy or perhaps embarrassed and the other flirtatious. 3. : Berger says that 'every square inch' of the painting appeals to the sense of touch. It doesn't. I couldn't even tell that anything was meant to be metal until I read Berger's description. My first impression was that the two subjects look staggeringly similar, and the distorted skull is weird and looks like a rendering issue. 4. : Berger says that the landowners' 'proprietary attitude towards what surrounds them' is evident in their stance and expressions. I can't see anything of the sort, they just look sort of squinty. Maybe I'm just not good at the sort of interpretation Berger likes to imagine for art. I certainly didn't get any sense of narrative in the three purely visual chapters, and struggled to even see any kind of point in any of the portfolios. My issues with Berger are larger than simply not being able to see what he sees in art, though. The title of the book is 'Ways of Seeing', and it is hard for me to escape the impression that what this refers to more than anything is the ability of art critics to see their own politics in art, regardless of anything actually visible in the piece itself. This is demonstrated by his own example. Aside from the first chapter, which presented the most convincing thesis (about shifts in the value of art), his textual chapters read like a 70's liberal hit list: he sees as important about art the objectification of women, 'possessions', and capitalism. There is no mention of realism/fabulism or anything important in different schools of art, and throughout it all he adopts a critical tone about the hegemony of European art -- despite including very few and primitive examples from any other source. I thought with the nudes he had a glimmer of a point -- the women are being objectified, and sometimes they are even being contorted so that they can be nude to the viewer. But this is almost a foundational premise of that whole class of art, and it's hardly shocking to learn that pictures of naked ladies are mostly for the pleasure of men. And, you know, for all that Berger lectures about issues with the nude, he sure seems to include a lot of them in his book. And I don't just mean in the chapters discussing nudes. Every single chapter has multiple nudes in it, though they are rarely central to anything he discusses. I wonder whether Berger himself considers his reader to be male? Regarding oil paintings and ownership, his argument seems highly contorted and bizarre, and he seems to stretch very hard to bring in snippets like ""if a man stole a potato he risked a public whipping"" which reinforce his narrative of wealth and possession and oppression without actually having anything to do with any art. Why is it that oil paintings in particular are about 'owning' the pictured thing, when that 'thing' can be anything from a landscape to people to a story to an ideal? After reading Berger, I still don't know why he thinks this, and really I grow more suspicious that he just wanted to make some appropriately Marxist noises. His analysis of advertising is less objectionable -- who doesn't find adverts annoying? -- but seems somewhat unstable when balanced on top of his wobbly oil painting thesis. He makes a series of assertions about what advertising images are, but again fails to substantiate most of these. I think the idea, really, is that you have to enter the book either 1) already agreeing with John Berger about everything, possibly because you're a liberal university student in the '70s or 2) willing to let John Berger just make sweeping statements which you will accept. The ideas in the first chapter are the most interesting, and I think the most well-argued of them all. No doubt the rest is useful as a possible perspective for thinking about art, but there is no real information being communicated here that isn't already communicated by the politics of half a century ago."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Berger opens this book with the claim that it is going to mostly be an edifying attempt to open a dialogue about vision and art, or at least incite the reader to start thinking for him or herself; it becomes clear pretty quickly that he is of the opinion that all thought converges rapidly & ultimately on the chronic terms, concepts and fixations of academic Marxism. Hastily and speciously reiterating Benjamin (and Heidegger, as these types like to pretend they haven't read), he gives a brief rundown on the way desire and attitude shape vision, notably leading to unfair and usually pornographic depictions of women for ""the male gaze"" (a phrase which Berger coined) ... he then drops the pretension of discussing art and spends the rest of the book explaining the evils of property ownership and, in a sub-McLuhanian waxing, advertising. The common motif in this book is the employment of kitsch, and the banal treatments of subject matters innate thereto, as the principle artwork discussed, such that the reader unacquainted with art will come away thinking that fewer than ten painters of intellectual interest every lived -- and, when occasionally deciding to note their existence, Berger claims that all artists who intelligently arranged their works did so solely as an explicit objection to capitalism. This book, then, is not so much an invitation to thought as an active and seemingly deliberate attempt to instill in its reader a sort of gnostic paranoia, that all reality ultimately reduces to 'rich man bad', and that all art, emotion, and endeavour are ultimately mere functions of this noumenal truth. Indeed, its overwhelming popularity seems to have had the intended effect, being one of many precursors to the current ""post-leftist"" epoch which presumes the same compulsive fixation on these Marxist concepts (which even they agree are untenable and nonsensical, but which it is apparently impossible to stop repeating). It's crazy to me that drivel like this is so popular, and serves as the introduction for so many to the visual arts as a subject ... although this, indeed, explains much more about so many things that strike me as crazy in the world of letters. One could blame Berger's country of birth for such intellectual disingenuity, but he was also a failed painter: there appears to be some precedent for a link between that and maliciously ignorant political mental complexes."

The world of art as we know it is consumed by us everyday and is both a reflection of the past and contains a mysterious cultural lens that helps us navigate through different mediums of art. By putting forward a perspective of oil-paintings, nude as a theme in art in light of feminism and publicity as the last dying breath of these art cultures, it invites you to sit and think about capitalism, democracy and what being free truly means and whether the world today has truly achieved that or just pretends it has. We’re often taught to love art and let ourselves be blown away by the interpretations of what it represents, the life it glorifies, the past it mystifies with the promise of gaining knowledge and becoming more cultured. But seldom are we driven to actually stop and think about whether the way we’re viewing art is indeed accurate or in line with the past in which it was birthed and the market through which it survived. For anyone who loves art, history and economy, this short book puts forward an interesting critique of art and society.

I wrote out some of my thoughts and then came across some of the same ideas in this insightful beautiful booklet. Perhaps this is why I feel so strongly towards the first of the essays. Nevertheless, I try here to capture the essence of it, in some quotes that I deem crucial: I: • An image became a record of how X had seen Y. • The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe • If we accept that we can see that hill over there, we propose that from that hill we can be seen. The reciprocal nature of vision is more fundamental than that of spoken dialogue. And often dialogue is an attempt to verbalize this – an attempt to explain how, either metaphorically or literally, ‘you see things’, and an attempt to discover how ‘he sees things'. • An image is a sight which has been recreated or reproduced. It is an appearance, or a set of appearances, which has been detached from the place and time in which it first made its appearance and preserved – for a few moments or a few centuries. Every image embodies a way of seeing. • Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing. • In the end, the art of the past is being mystified because a privileged minority is striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify the role of the ruling classes, and such a justification can no longer make sense in modern terms. And so, inevitably, it mystifies. • Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw it before. We actually perceive it in a different way. • The art of the past no longer exists as it once did. Its authority is lost. In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose III: • [A woman’s] nakedness is not, however, an expression of her own feelings; it is a sign of her submission to the owner’s feelings or demands. • Almost all post-Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal – either literally or metaphorically – because the sexual protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. • Here and in the European tradition generally, the convention of not painting the hair on a woman’s body helps towards the same end. Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion. The woman’s sexual passion needs to be minimized so that the spectator may feel that he has the monopoly of such passion • It is worth noticing that in other non-European traditions – in Indian art, Persian art, African art, Pre-Columbian art – nakedness is never supine in this way. And if, in these traditions, the theme of a work is sexual attraction, it is likely to show active sexual love as between two people, the woman as active as the man, the actions of each absorbing the other. V: • “What distinguishes oil painting from any other form of painting is its special ability to render the tangibility, the texture, the lustre, the solidity of what it depicts. It defines the real as that which you can put your hands on. Although its painted images are two-dimensional, its potential of illusionism is far greater than that of sculpture, for it can suggest objects possessing colour, texture and temperature, filling a space and, by implication, filling the entire world.” • “Oil paintings often depict things. Things which in reality are buyable. To have a thing painted and put on a canvas is not unlike buying it and putting it in your house. If you buy a painting you buy also the look of the thing it represents.” • “The art of any period tends to serve the ideological interests of the ruling class” • “Such a painting is a demonstration of more than the virtuosity of the artist. It confirms the owner’s wealth and habitual style of living” • “Works of art in earlier traditions celebrated wealth. But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth – which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in its tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” • “Each time a painter realized that he was dissatisfied with the limited role of painting as a celebration of material property and of the status that accompanied it, he inevitably found himself struggling with the very language of his own art as understood by the tradition of his calling.”"

I wish I had years ago. Although the examples from its 1970s origin are dated, its thesis is perhaps even more valid today than then: Oil painting emerged just as the Western world entered the era of capitalism and imperialism. The technique of perspective makes the viewer the center of all he (yes, Virginia, ""he"") sees, just as ""Western man"" viewed the resources of the world. Oil paintings, therefore, became a vehicle by which Western man could enjoy, in rich realistic detail, what he owned. Since the beginning of the 20th century, art has lost this patron-satisfying confidence, but its bastard child, advertising, has perverted the view even more by presenting, not what is already owned, but what we should desire to own, thus serving the needs of capitalism even further. Yes, a few cobwebs of Marxism hang about the theory, but it provides a thought-provoking analysis of the convergence of artistic technique and social context."

Berger successfully explains how what we see is influenced by what we believe and know. Reading images feels intuitive to us, since it's the most immediate way of communicating. As Berger points out in the opening sequence: There's one essay which talks about the difference between the and and thematises what would later be termed the male gaze and how those traditional Western oil paintings were a way of showing possession, wealth and status. Those beautiful hairless female bodies were rarely (if ever) about the women themselves, but about what their existence meant for the spectator / owner. In his last essay he handles the issue of why advertisement is so absurd and yet so effective. As he points out, what people are trying to sell us is the future – a future in which we can be envied and desired. It's a depressing thought, but sadly doesn't feel altogether wrong: but the points made were all interesting to consider.

It offers a multi-pronged approach towards understanding how images and meaning are conjoined and how our historic development from art as a religious utility to art as advertisement/propaganda has only served to confuse us further. In some sense, we are inundated with images but we are not literate of their effect on us. This book seeks to compel us to not confuse the pleasures of seeing with their sly deceptions. While much of the past art (images) has been examined and studied our current relationship with art, with images, has not been. Instead, we are made to believe what is shown to us, as the narrow definitions of success and motive are foised to our awareness without much critical awareness as to how else to understand what is being proposed. Instead, we are made to focus attention on very narrow parameters often to the detriment of our extended possibilities. We do not realize what we are doing, we are made to realize what we should do; instead of why. Our interests are made in alignment with the interests of those producing the images. In some sense this is an incomplete book. It's a brave stab at what is going on, but it begs another, fuller look as to the relationship behind images, in part, because there is no critical framework. Choosing the right framework would further us greatly but as there is relatively no framework for assessing the multivalence of images, this book does not need one to do what it is doing."

A few of the essays are verbal; the others are visual (A collection of images. What do you see when you watch them?).

One essay, the third one, is about the role of men and women in art. Obviously a very delicate matter nowadays. No one would claim now that ‘men act and women appear’ (Page 47) because of the changing role of gender and because of new technical developments: Aren’t we all occupied with how we appear, since we started using Facebook and Instagram? I would have loved to know what John Berger and his team would have thought about that!

It has profound insights into sickness and emptiness of modern society. Berger reminds us to be conscious about what you are looking at and experiencing; He criticizes traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. ‘Ways of Seeing’ was originally a 1972 BBC TV series, which rapidly became regarded as one of the most influential art programs ever made. At the very start of the first episode, John Berger takes a scalpel to ; the blade’s rough abrasion on canvas. The painting Berger cut was a facsimile, but the metaphor of the scalpel is plain: to question is to dissect. It is to cut past the scrim of beauty, and reveal more fundamental anatomies: capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, mimetic desire, and so on. This opening of Ways of Seeing presents a filmic reenactment of the argument of Walter Benjamin’s essay ; which he wrote during the terrifying onrush of fascism. He saw the crisis of European liberalism as, in part, a result of the emergence of new media, like photography and phonograph. Other machines of replication, along with these, had produced a more disturbing change in social consciousness. He was also interested in the entire network of mass mediation and the new, seemingly unanchored art form of film. He believed a broader shift is happening leading to nothing less than ‘the shattering of tradition’ and the ‘liquidation of the value of tradition in the cultural heritage’. As new forms of technological culture replaced the old, civilization moved into a halfway house of mediation, susceptible to new modes of political adventurism and mass behaviour. Too bad, it only had four episodes. Carl Sagan’s amazing television series ‘Cosmos’ too had just 12 parts. Meanwhile, ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ has 250+ episodes. As I said, it talks about sickness and emptiness of modern society… Five star for the series. Part (, , , )"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The 1970s and 1980s saw significant shifts in the ways we thought about art history, alongside its attempts to engage popular audiences. There were BBC TV shows in the 1970s that took art history outside the academy – for the traditionalist view there was Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation and others which espoused a conventional academic art historical view. Whereas Clark’s is seen as one of those shows that had lasting power and gravitas (which it did) the show that had the impact was John Berger’s in 1972. This is the book of that show. Unlike most books of art history, this is not a large format, lavishly illustrated in colour, glossy papered text, but a small paperback (glossy paper but with small black and white illustrations) and written in an accessible, engaging, pedagogic and didactic style that demands we think, rise to the challenge and answer the questions put to us. In this sense, Berger was part of the change in art history that saw the emergence of scholars such as Janet Wolff, Marcia Pointon, Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others who demanded that we understand art and art history as a social product, as a system of power and ideology with the result that pictures were not just pictures but social, cultural and political texts. In his version of this approach, Berger argues that the emergence of the canon of art as we know it and see it in the oil painting is linked to the emergence of capitalism and its peculiar deployment of power. He (and his unnamed co-authors – in the preface he says there are five authors) does this through seven essays, four written and three visual, exploring perspective and power (western art’s deployment of perspective places the viewer at the centre of the picture and valorises them, the nude, oil painting and advertising (which he calls publicity) while the visual essays argue for recognition of the place of high art in the popular present, for an understanding of power and dominance in the canon and claims to possession. When this book was published in 1972 this was a radical new way to think about old pictures on stuffy museum walls, and when I first read it in the early 1980s it remained provocative and challenging. It was with a sense of intrigue then that I came back to it 40 years after publication to consider whether it would be something I should set my students to read in an attempt to get them thinking differently about advertising. Although many of the ideas have become more mainstream, and although some of the writing has dated (for instance, it is gendered in ways we’d challenge now) the case retains its power and its pedagogic potential. It is humbling to find such a popularly accessible book that is both 40 years old and as powerful and important at is was when it first appeared. On its own terms it works, and we should not under-estimate its impact – but it will be intriguing to see what my students make of it. I am delighted to have revisited it."

Update on 17 March: 3.5 out of 5 I first read this book on a 7-hour bus ride from Paris to Maastricht. I could feel a strong, burning gaze projecting from my left side the whole time. When the owner of that gaze, the Dutch girl that sat beside me, could no longer hold it in and asked me what was it about the book that made me seem so immersed in it, I really wanted point to the intangible conversation that started travelling between us and say, "", is exactly why."" I wasn't really reading. There was no way that one could absorb Berger throughout all that bumpiness. I merely acted like I was focused so that I didn't have to socialize. Other than my inability to enjoy normal socialization, I also couldn't quite aptly explain to her what's so mesmerizing about the book. Therefore, after 2 years, now that I'm working in an art organisation, I feel the urgent need to re-read this book. And there are only two things: 1. John Berger might be explaining things that you already know but just sit tight and sit through it because he'll explain it like you've never heard it before. The way he writes is sheer . 2. There's no better way of explaining Berger than by directly quoting him, for examples see below: The above is only the tip of the iceberg. As much as it fills my heart with wholesomeness as a pleasant read should, I believe this book is just what we all cite to make something that we wrote, which despite already making enough sense on its own, sounds better."
Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Ways of Seeing peels off the layers of difference between ""seeing"" and ""looking"" as it pertains to our perception of visual works of art. While looking is a natural phenomenon that happens through the interactions of our retinas with the outside world, seeing assumes an understanding, a context, a subject. Seeing, is an art in itself. Berger might just be one of the first people who situates ""seeing"" in this complicated setting for a wide audience. In the seven chapters of this book, Berger uncovers the social and political context of art as it has evolved through the last couple of centuries, drawing fascinating conclusions regarding the monetary value of art, its relation to our dreams, desires, bodies and class. I suspect some parts of this book, depending on the chapter and corresponding essays, are not particularly revolutionary to readers who are already familiar with said essays. For example, anyone who has read the renowned by Walter Bejamin, will not find the corresponding chapter in striking. But for others, Berger provides a thought-provoking and sensitive route. This is a wonderful book. The prose is both uncomplicated and compelling, beckoning the reader to keep reading. Berger has a gentle but keen style of writing and a sincere passion for art that radiates in-between the lines. There is a kindness, a caring, in his sensibility that I felt again and again as I read through, and yet, I can't fully describe what I mean by this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to understand what it means to ""see"" art, and I also recommend that you take advantage of the wonderful (perhaps also melancholic; read the book to understand what I mean by this) digital accessibility of the mentioned paintings and photographs to view them in a better quality while Berger discusses them."

Revisited for a reference and ended up rereading it . As fascinating as it is pioneering ( considering it was written in 1972, way back in capitalism's childhood, well before it grew up and cast it's powerful grip around the idea of human life). Berger and co essentially chart the history of visual imagery in art, from the era of oil painting to television, slowly peeling out layer after layer teasing out the implicit messages and societal subtexts hidden within the images, and quite remarkably without preaching a communist manifesto! Berger is still alive and kicking, I would be really curious to know his views on modern-age consumerism as a culture. It would be just wonderful if he takes time out to write a sequel - possibly commenting on the new era capitalism - from designer handbags to high definition televisions, perhaps not on the idea of compulsive consumerism as such ( which has been already covered here) but more on the consumers themselves as a cohort. The need for the consumerism and perhaps suggestions about alternatives?"

It's something that I think about very often when exploring our world and all of its stories and pictures: why is it like this, who does it serve, what do we see and what do we actually see and what is the undertone and so forth. In a way I got muuuuuch more from ""Sinut on nähty"" by Anu Silfverberg than by this but then again this did exist a long time before that so I'm not putting them against each other but saying that they complimented each other in terms of the gaze. Maybe I'm just thinking about it because the part about the way women were painted had an impact on me and was way bigger than its length.

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The novelist and artist John Berger published Ways of Seeing as a supplement to a BBC documentary series about art history in 1972. It is a slim volume. Its ideas are weak, unoriginal, and poorly reasoned. It Is certainly a good book to ignore. Not one single chapter carries much intellectual weight. A prime example of Berger’s weak reasoning is in the section on the portrayal of nude women in art. Berger’s claim is that women in Renaissance paintings appear without clothing for the purpose of being enjoyed by aristocratic male viewers. As if that needed to be explained. The owner of each painting, presumably a male though it is hard to imagine that no women ever saw this stuff, owns the nude woman depicted the same way he owns property. Her nudity symbolizes his dominance and superiority over her. Her missing pubic hair symbolizes her lack of will in making sexual choices. While these claims may be true, Berger does not offer any explanation as to why we should accept his interpretation. John Berger says it is true so we must accept it as truth, case closed. By logical extension, this is like saying you own Jimi Hendrix’s corpse because you bought one of his records. Owning a painting of a woman is not equivalent to owning a woman. The painters hired women to model for them which entails the reality that those women could accept or reject the offer of hiring themselves out as models; this means they made choices. The painters themselves did not keep women chained up in dungeons. And Berger never takes up the idea that those women may actually have wanted and chosen to be portrayed in such ways. He does not cite one instance of a Renaissance woman saying anything whatsoever about her role as a painter’s model. So where does Berger get this idea from? He never tells. He also never cites any examples of what that time’s painters or aristocratic art patrons thought about these depictions of nude women either. Yet Berger claims to know exactly what they thought. Even worse, he writes as if all upper-class European men thought identical thoughts about women and he writes as though all women have identical thoughts about how women in paintings are portrayed. Common sense would tell you that opinions vary from person to person so overgeneralizing about whole populations of people who died long before he was born is absurd. Even if we accept his claim, which does appear to be plausible, why should be so concerned anyways? If the images are symbolic depictions, we do not have to automatically accept the content of the symbol as being legitimate. Each person can agree or disagree with the merits of what is symbolized as they choose. The ability and intent of the viewer to choose interpretations is never addressed either. John Berger’s stance as a male art critic in this matter is questionable too. He interprets these paintings on behalf of women without acknowledging whether or not he even consulted with women on the matter. How does he claim to be a representative and spokesperson for women? Isn’t he denying women a voice in this issue by claiming to be the arbiter of correct interpretations on their behalf? Isn’t that a form of male domination that he would otherwise decry? After all, he complains about women not having their own voice in Renaissance art so doesn’t this make him guilty of the same crime? The chapter on oil painting is no better. Rich Europeans buy paintings of objects because owning paintings of objects is the same as owning, or at least desiring to own, the object itself. Buying and owning a painting of a farm is the same as owning a farm. But how does ho know this? Research into how art owners of the time thought about ownership and art is nonexistent in Berger’s monologue. Why is this even raised as a problem? Are we supposed to accept at face value that purchasing and owning property is inherently wrong? Berger was a communist sympathizer so his answer would be “yes, owning property is inherently wrong”. But why should this idea be accepted? Just because he says so? If property is so terrible than why did John Berger sell his own paintings? Why did he have his books published by large corporate publishing firms to be sold as objects in a capitalist marketplace? Why did he choose to live in England instead of moving to the Soviet Union which was still communist in the 1970s? In the USSR, he would not have had the freedom to paint what he wanted to and he would not be allowed to publish books that criticize the political or economic system so maybe John Berger was being just a little bit of a hypocrite by hating the system he depended on for his own intellectual freedom. The final chapter is about the direct connection between oil painting and advertising. He does provide some insight into the psychology of advertising which makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and incomplete. Advertising provokes the consumer to desire products that make them feel part of an elite, like the Renaissance era aristocracy who owned the most property. No doubt, that appears to be more or less true. But again, so what? Why is it wrong to want to buy things? There do not appear to be many people in the world who do not want to have any possessions at all. But John Berger never examines the other side of the argument. His accusatory tone is manipulative and authoritarian; he wants to lay a heavy guilt trip on his audience and in the end, guilt trips are all about controlling people. Just read what Nietzsche and Foucault had to say about the Christian church’s use of guilt as a method of coercion and domination. Ways of Seeing presents us with sparsely worded text with weak reasoning and tiny black and white pictures meant to exemplify what he says. The claims lack intellectual rigor and the pictures are so difficult to see that this whole book comes off as a poorly executed work of juvenile nonsense. It is best to pass this one over. Its proper place is in the recycling bin."

I thoroughly enjoyed the perspectives on women as objects in art, on oil paintings as a product and/or catalyst of capitalism, and on publicity (my Guy Debord read earlier this year came in handy here). My only point of criticism, and one I know has to do with the time this was written and published, is the air of finality with which the authors speak about the gender binary and the (mental) cages women are put/put themselves in. This would probably have been worded differently in a re-worked edition and maybe even extended to other genders and sexualities. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in art, sociology, or critique of capitalism."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"By and large, I'm not a fan of manifestos. This one was no exception. It had a lot of insight, as manifestos often do, and I learned a lot from it, which is also not atypical. But to my mind, there's something insulting about a manifesto. To borrow a metaphor from Eudora Welty, writing like this is the equivalent of serving me my brain food already cut up for me. The ideas may be deeper than a trashy romance novel (for example), but the level of respect for the audience is roughly the same. And I always tend, right or wrong, to begin judging the ideology in question through the lens of that disrespect. If they have this much distrust for people in general, then how can their ideas about life not be tainted with that fundamental distrust? Since I do not share that distrust, how much am I really going to accept the ideas they've built on it? All of that is the case, as I said, with manifestos in general. So what about this particular one? the book, is apparently based on a BBC series of the same name and with the same purpose. Their purpose is to get us to look at art in a different way (namely, and being a leftist myself I don't throw this term around lightly: in a Marxist way). They begin with a very simplistic explanation of the importance of sight (based, apparently, on the fact that we are able to see before we are able to do just about anything else—never mind that we actually start using all four of our other senses before we even open our eyes), and then go on to the importance of visual art: painting, photography, that kind of thing. Then they leap straight into the Marxism and attempt to show the ways in which art, especially painting, has always been used to promote capitalism (even, it seems, before there was capitalism) and to celebrate the virtue of the propertied class. Some of which is interesting, actually, but some of which is stretching quite a bit. In true manifesto fashion, they make sure to consistently point out the ways in which seeming exceptions actually prove the rule. Also in true manifesto fashion, they are careful to pick the most egregious examples they can find in order to make their points without looking like they picked the most egregious examples available. I have to include one quote, because I think it's so emblematic. Or, to put it another way: ""We're rubber, you're glue. Bounces off us and sticks to you."" They're right about the nature of obsession, I'm sure, but that isn't much of a defence since their own argument could be described with that sentence. Here's the thing, though. There's a lot of value in the book. I actually do have a new way of seeing art now, and I think it's a better informed way. I also have a more complex understanding of some other issues, ranging from the nature of masculinity to the nature of history to the nature of envy and beyond. All of which is good, and all of which is despite the fact that this isn't my first exposure to many of these ideas. I got this book on a recommendation from a prof in grad school, and in his class and others I did think about & discuss many of these ideas. But the value of a manifesto, I suppose, is that (since they almost completely disregard opposing viewpoints) they can really succinctly get deep into the ideas at hand. So there is a lot to be gained from a book like this. Even if I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. P.S. I must say something about the design of this book. It's horrible. Really, absolutely terrible. Take a closer look at that cover image (click on it and look at the large version). The text on there is actually the beginning of the book. It's repeated again inside, but I guess they thought they'd look more serious and utilitarian if they just started right in with the cover? This book also suffers from the same ridiculous modernist notion (later completely disavowed by Jan Tschichold, who started it) that sans-serif fonts are better than serif fonts because they are free of the ""adornment"" of serifs. They take it one step further here, and use a bold sans-serif throughout the book. Which is just dumb. Many of their other design choices (full one-inch paragraph indentations, for example) are equally dumb, and the book looks like it was thrown together in half an hour by a high-school journalism class. Really, it's just atrocious. P.P.S. The book ends, and I'm not kidding, with a page that has one line on it: The absolute pretension at work here was almost more than I had the stomach for."

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing” was one of the books I had to read. When the slim volume arrived, it was a bit of an anticlimax: the writing was in bold letters, the photographs of paintings were in black and white, lots of them. Apparently, it sprang out of a series of Television programmes shown in 1972. It is worth watching the series on You Tube, and certainly more rewarding. He is, I think, the precursor of the excellent television art historians and critics we see today, who all, in their individual ways, present works of art with a fresh and original eye. By that very fact, his successors have overtaken him. There is a certain aridity in Berger’s approach in the book; he is following a thesis and aligning what he sees to conform to his thesis. He is very good at analysing the paintings, of making us aware of how certain aspects of life and the information we glean influence the way we view them. He goes into the fundamentals of what it means to see a work of art or a painting. His strength lies in delving into the philosophical and social aspects which link paintings with our emotions and lives. “Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognises before he can speak.” “It is seeing that establishes our place in the surrounding world. ...We explain that world with words.” The relationship between what we see and what we know is never settled. He gives an example, ""The Key of Dreams"" by Magritte, which shows the gap between words and seeing. Our knowledge of certain fundamental facts does not somehow fit what we see, as in the setting of the sun. I had not consciously thought of why the dislocation between image and word in Magritte’s paintings speaks to me, and why we do not dismiss his work as that of a lunatic. The other interesting observation is that in art, perspective became all important – in other words, the viewer or the creator were the main characters. Then came the camera, liberating image from time and space. Paintings, he argues, were a capitalist concept. They adorned the houses of the rich, they showed the opulence of their interiors and the objects that surrounded them, the clothes they wore and their estates. When it became possible to reproduce paintings, the philosophical question of what painting was in itself could be posed. There is a picture of a Van Gogh painting of a cornfield with birds. We are invited to look at it and then turn the page and see it with this explanation: “this is the last picture that Van Gogh painted before he killed himself.” Notice how the knowledge the words convey influence the way we see the painting. I am reminded of how the life of a writer sometimes colours the way we view their book, which is why I often like to come to the novel without knowing anything about the author. In the section on The Nude, he describes how Woman is depicted. There are many illustrations. Woman thinks of how she appears to others and ultimately how she appears to men. She is aware of the spectator. She is sometimes shown with a mirror, a symbol of vanity. In non-European art (Indian, Persian, preColumbian) nakedess is not supine. There is mutual attraction between the sexes. Berger makes a clear distinction between what it means to be naked, to be without clothes, and what it is to be nude, which is to be a mere object of display. Nowadays, this resonates even more strongly. Section 5 is on objects in paintings. The last section is on publicity. Posters and publicity material are juxtaposed with paintings, needing almost no commentary. “the oil painting was addressed to those who make money out of the market. Publicity is addressed to those who constitute the market.” “All publicity”, he writes, “works upon anxiety. The sum of everything is money, to get money is to overcome anxiety. Alternatively the anxiety on which publicity plays is the fear that having nothing you will be nothing.” Try as we might, it is an environent we cannot escape."

A phrase the author must've mentioned about twice is: ""someone should research this"", and he's right, because I want to know more about it. There are four actual essays with text in them. I didn't really get the first one, however, it was based on a little text by Walter Benjamin called ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"", which I, completely coincidentally, bought alongside this book, because I wanted to read something about art, these next couple of days, so I suppose I'll read that one tomorrow. The second one was about the way women are represented in paintings - that is: different from men, they become objects often sexualized as well, creating this weird way women look at themselves as being perceived by others and themselves as well, very interesting. The third essay was about oil paintings. It was good. Good things, how it was heavily influenced by things like social status, certain paintings representing things which remind the people who own the paintings of their wealth. You know, I was in a museum, a couple of months ago, and there were a lot of paintings of exorbitant amounts of food. I never really got why they were made, until now, thanks to this book. Berger really just showed you always have to see a painting in all of the context in which it was made, really great stuff and will probably change the way I'll look at certain paintings in the future. His last essay (maybe my favorite one, I don't know, they were all great) touched on the loose connection between oil paintings and publicity, but really it just seemed like an excuse to talk a bit about publicity and consumerism, which I actually didn't mind at all, even though the world of advertising has evolved so much some of it doesn't really translate to today that well. All in all, I really liked it, I can only recommend this, to be honest and I think I'll certainly take a look at the series this was based on. That's it. Read this book, alright. Have a good rest of your day!"

Ways of Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2784.Ways_of_Seeing/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars for this. Ways of Seeing by John Berger is a book about art and art criticism. It's made of seven essays, each treating different topics related to perception and image through art, where Berger explores the various layers of the visual world that is such a great and unavoidable part of our daily lives. He does that by using images and words, without dragging and staying on the same idea for too long, which makes the book really fast and easy to read. What I liked about was some specific essays, and how Berger treated some of the topics. He has a remarkable way of analysing complex subjects that go centuries back in very few words, which was impressive and very welcomed. An essay where I found myself agreeing with every word was essay 3, where Berger talks about the depiction of women in European art through the centuries, and more specifically the depiction of nude women. It was a mix of art, psychology and philosophy, more so than the other essays, and it showed the striking but absolutely not surprising or new chasm between the image of men and women in society, and so, inevitably, in art. What I didn't like about was, well, also some specific essays. There were some essays, such as the last one, that made me skim or sleep or fall asleep while skimming. Because of the way this book is formed, I know I would be asking for too much if I expected to like all of the seven subjects treated. The last essay, for example, was all about publicity, which could have been interesting -and I'm sure it was for some people-, if it didn't analyse such superficial concepts. I didn't feel like it was teaching me anything, because yes, we all know that images in publicity are meant to pass messages like ""if you buy this you become desirable, if you can't buy it you're not desirable"". In other words, I know this book is always recommended to people who are into art, and since it's short and easy to read you don't have anything to lose by reading it; I'd mostly recommend it to people who are into visual studies in general, though, as they might benefit more from reading it."

Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless. He lives in the contradiction between what he is and what he would like to be. Either he then becomes so fully conscious of the contradiction and its causes, and so joins the political struggle for a full democracy which entails, amongst other things, the overthrow of capitalism; or else he lives, continually subject to an envy which, compounded with his sense of powerlessness, dissolves into recurrent day-dreams"""

But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in it tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” 7-“the spectator-buyer is meant to envy herself as she will become if she buys the product. She is meant to imagine herself transformed by the product into an object of envy for others, an envy which will then justify her loving herself.

At the time of publication this was a revolutionary book and proposed a whole new way of looking at paintings. I still find it a refreshing analysis but it is, as to be expected, in urgent need of an update. I would love to hear Berger discuss ways of seeing now and whether his position has changed in any way. The Marxist analysis dates the book but I think Berger is still committed to this understanding and firmly believe that class is an important distinction in understanding society and us as individuals. Certainly in the UK. It is naïve to believe that how we perceive images does not depend upon our own way of seeing, yet the way we are encouraged to look at art is affected by a range of assumptions. This can create a number of contradictions within the viewer. I also like the way he addresses gender and issues of sexuality. Equally, his discussion around art and advertising raises a number of interesting issues. This is a short and relatively easy read"

Berger synthesizes ideas from Walter Benjamin, Levi-Strauss, and other thinkers succinctly and to great effect. He powers through the obfuscatory bullshit of art historians to get to meaty ideas about power and wealth, though I will warn you about a leftward slant. Personally, I'm in complete agreement with him, but if you are in a different political camp, or if you subscribe to the aforementioned obfuscatory bullshit, this book will probably have you sputtering with indignation. Sputter away, friends. Although it was written in the 70's, I found most of it still very relevant, especially (and sadly) the essay on women. Only the last essay on advertising felt dated: not that it wasn't still true, only to a greater degree. I'd love to see the television shows on which the essays are based."

With many such transcendent statements like the above, no wonder this book is so successful. Ok I’m being facetious. Partway through the first chapter John Berger admits he’s just paraphrasing Baudrillard. Then he goes on to summarise Laura Mulvey’s scopophilia; and presumably someone else for the next chapters on ownership and the city. 50% of the book is images. Apparently Brits have an affinity for this as it was turned into a tv-show. I originally went to university for art theory so admittedly this all felt like watered down retreads of roads others have already paved.

Like every art history student in the late 70s, I first read it in an Introduction to Art History class. It is in itself a historical document; published before America's fascination with French theory really took hold, and it neatly and succinctly offers capsule overviews of Benjamin and Barthes as well as a good if somewhat dated analysis of the nude from a feminist viewpoint. When Berger wrote this book, he was very much the rebellious iconoclast (going so far as to suggest that traditional oil painting reified capitalist hegemony and even slavery), and his romance with Marxism and theory of desire now seem a little naive. Nevertheless, his work remains interesting for evoking a certain tenor of the times...and it's quite an easy read as far as theory goes."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Reflecting on my reading year 2016, I came to think of books that have meant a lot to me over the past decades, and the first one that came to my mind was Gombrich’s excellent introduction to art history. I will have to go back twenty years, half my life, to the year 1996. I am twenty years old, and just about to discover the pleasurable adventure called university. For Christmas, I receive a much longed-for gift card to buy books that “will help me in my studies”, and I stand in a bookstore, one of those exquisite, inexhaustible bookstores on several floors that German university cities provide, and I am browsing through options. I probably spend hours there. I can still feel the time pass, while I look, think, go through history, art, literature. I pick a book, then another one, and more still, until I have to bring one back. Gift card value is weighed against all these lovely, lovely possibilities. At this moment in time, I own one Billy bookshelf, and it is not filled yet, as my children’s books and classics are left at my parents’ house. What do I pick? I don’t remember the fiction, but I do remember picking a “start of the term offer”, Mayersches Taschenlexikon, in 34 volumes, rarely used, as the internet takes over soon, and it is inconvenient to look up definitions by going through entries in alphabetical order. Some time between 1996 and now, it falls victim to one of our many moves between cities and countries. I don’t have it anymore. I bought it out of duty. I choose one extravaganza: Gombrich. A German hardback copy, beautifully illustrated, taking a huge chunk of the gift card money. I start reading as soon as I come home. And almost magically, it opens up the world of art to me. I learn why Egyptians “walk like Egyptians”, I discover Rubens, Bernini, Raphael, Leonardo, and Delacroix,and Canova, Manet and Monet, and Picasso, Duchamp and, and, and... I discover the world through a visual prism. Ever since then, Gombrich has followed my path. I soon come to read his more specialised works on form, function and symbolism in Renaissance art, I learn about his life, deeply influenced by 20th century history, and I keep going back to “The Story Of Art” whenever I need to take a step back and look at general ideas again. And I steal my mother’s Swedish copy! I want to read it aloud to my children, and they are only used to their father reading in German, and me in Swedish. So in order not to confuse them more than necessary in their Babylonian curse, I read it in Swedish, the stolen goods. And what a help that has been in the many museums around the world that my children have visited over the years. They recognise their “Gombrich” when they see it. Two years ago, my eldest son wants a copy - in English, in order to be able to quote from it. And of course I can’t resist buying it for him, at a shop inside the British Museum. So we have three copies, and I would not be beyond buying one in French, at a shop in the Louvre, maybe, just for the silliness of owning a favourite in so many different shapes. For they are all slightly different in layout, but equally satisfying visually and textually. I still recommend it to whoever wants a clear, concise, lovable account of the history starting with cave paintings in Lascaux, and moving forwards still, mirroring humanity in its need to express ideas, thoughts and feelings through the medium of art. My children and I will now be reading , which Gombrich wrote expressly for children, and YES - we read it in Swedish. And YES, we have it in English as well! And NO - one Billy bookshelf is not even enough for our children’s books anymore! This is The Story Of Lisa And The Story Of Art, to be continued..."

Gombrich covers all the major artists and the movements they represent, and ties them together with clarity. Like one of our most knowledgeable 'friends' on the art circuit at goodreads, he is discerning, but not judgmental. Indeed, Gombrich's account of the development of modern art - up until World War II -- is fabulous, though brief. Gombrich is much less upbeat on more recent trends -- he mentions Pop, but quite deliberately (it seems) refuses to even mention Warhol's name. I know that it's very difficult for people who know a great deal about something to recommend -- or even read - introductory books.

Gombrich is more than knowledgeable and yet manages to condense without condescending or reducing his narrative to trivial choices. He brings the freshness that comes with the enthusiasm of discovery. Of course, what he is sharing is not new to him, but sharing the works and his insights with the reader is new and exciting to him, and the enthusiasm is infectious. The intended audience is younger readers than myself, high school and college age readers or adults new to art history. But I found the book not just enjoyable but helpful and insightful.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I should preface everything I say with a general caveat: I am a novice in the world of art, which is the reason I picked up this book in the first place. Although I often drew as a child, I was more interested in schematic, technical drawings than anything you could call ‘art’. And, despite my keen appreciation of music and fiction, I’ve always had the visual equivalent of a ‘tin ear’. I could stand in front of a masterpiece and be more interested in what I just ate for lunch. So with that shameful admission out of the way, on to the review. In a book such as this, there are bound to be almost as many people disappointed as impressed. It’s the curse of the writer of survey books: to reduce the scope of the material down to the size of one volume, enormous omissions are inevitable. If sales alone are the to be the rubric, then Gombrich must be considered a tremendous success; nevertheless, many whose favorite paintings and sculptures were passed over without mention or comment will likely be irked. (It should also be said that his treatment of ‘primitive’ art is hopelessly uninformed and, despite his best efforts, condescending. Additionally, this book hardly touches on non-European art.) Due to my general ignorance, I was none too bothered by this. In fact, it was just what the doctor ordered. Gombrich sweeps the reader through Western history, allowing just enough time for some quick rubber-necking at the sites along the way. What you get is a brief who’s who, and the general lay of the land. Of course, anyone with an even moderate interest in art history will have to fill in the quite sizable gaps left by this method, but that’s to be expected. The only book somewhat similar to I've read is by Ian MacDonald—a song-by-song analysis and critique of the Beatles’s music. That book (highly recommended) is astounding because MacDonald’s ears are so frighteningly acute. Although I have musical training and have been listening to the Beatles since my youth, MacDonald makes you hear their music in new and exciting ways, opening up a whole new aural world. Gombrich does the same thing, but to a lesser extent, with the history of art. He has a keen eye; and, more impressive, he is able to render technical analysis into the plainest of plain prose. The reader’s mind is not burdened by the slew of art history terms that are thrown at undergraduates in introductory classes. Gombrich bypasses the linguistic apparatus and goes straight to what’s really important: the image on the canvass (or the form on the marble, etc.). So, to bring this already-too-long review to a close, read for a clear, concise, and engaging introduction to the world of visual art. It’s not one-stop shopping. But then, what book is?"

Of course, if you have some, this can make you seriously engage some of your previously held assumptions about what you like and why you like it, but I got the distinct impression while reading that it was meant to initiate a teenager – a teenager who very much reminded of me of myself – into a whole new world. The inclusions and exclusions of certain artists are, of course, always arbitrary. However, Gombrich’s choices do not deviate too much from a standard art history text. What particularly drew me to the book was what I perceived to be its inordinate focus on medieval and especially Renaissance art. Of the twenty-eight chapters included in the book, about five mostly focus on Western medieval images (6 and 8-11). Another six chapters (13-18) focus on the art of the Western Renaissance. Most surveys of art history to which I had been previously exposed paid scant attention to medieval art and they sometimes did not give the Renaissance the space that I felt it deserved. There is no doubt the medieval and Renaissance art Gombrich’s pet periods here (and, admittedly, they’re mine, too.) What makes it so special is that, instead of spending the first chapter in an abstract exercise of thinking about what “Art” is, he forces you over and over again to take the art on its own terms. While discussing the various visual perspectives painted by the artist of “The Garden of Nebamun,” he says: “To us reliefs and wall-paintings provide an extraordinarily vivid picture of life as it was lived in Egypt thousands of years ago. And yet, looking at them for the first time, one may find them rather bewildering. The reason is that the Egyptian painters had a very different way from ours of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the different purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artists’ task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to them from any fortuitous angle” (p. 60). It is the occasional insight like this that makes the book most worthwhile for a neophyte. After all, how many of us have measured something we saw by the standards of our particular narrow time and place? He really drives home the point that thinking about art seriously means thinking about other perspectives (both literally and figuratively), other preoccupations, and other aesthetic modus operandi. This is a lesson that should be lost on none of us, about art, or about anything else."

It is the o.g. primer on art history, so reading it gave me insight into the thought processes of some of my more old-school college professors. It also cleared up some of my shameful misconceptions around when certain artists were active (Titian 😳). The prose is very simple and engaging, and I looked forward to reading this book every day. However, I dread to imagine someone reading this in 2020 without a gargantuan grain of salt. Right off the bat, the book wildly speculates about the purposes of cave paintings (prehistoric people believed they were magic. obvs.). Any time it talks about non-Western art, the descriptions are pretty cringy. And female artists all but don't exist (I think the book names one). If there's a more contemporary art history book that is as thorough as this one, I'd love to hear about it."

I would like to be able to do the same thing with paintings. I would like to be able to look up a painting on my phone, and appreciate it anytime and anywhere. To most people, paintings are one dimensional, containing only what meets the eye. The reality of paintings is that they necessarily have enormous depth, ranging from the historical period during which they were created, what events lead to that point, the personal circumstances of the artist and the emotional and intellectual mental states of the artist during the act of painting. Paintings are snapshots of consciousness, and offer fertile ground for studying consciousness itself. I visited Rome and Florence in Italy in 2018 but failed to appreciate the grand artworks I saw there at the time. I hope I can appreciate these masterpieces more on my next visit. That being said, I did cry a little standing beneath David by Michelangelo. I didn't have the maturity to appreciate great art at the time, but David nevertheless evoked powerful emotions in me. In , Gombrich asserts that there are no wrong reasons for liking an art, but that there are wrong reasons for disliking an art.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This well-composed book was a pleasure to read. And as far as introducing the history of art, it is exactly what I was looking for; beautiful photographs, lucid descriptions, no jargon, no pretension. I recommend that you read the short preface and first chapter, and I bet that you won’t stop there. The book’s 600 pages contain at least as many photographs, mostly of paintings, and about half of those figures are full-page (including a few fold-outs [ooh la la:]). The text is written simply – without jargon, footnotes, endnotes or appeal to authority. Mr. Gombrich’s restraint is impressive, since he obviously has a deep knowledge and personal appreciation for the topic. Instead of appealing to authority, he draws upon the art itself and universal human instincts to help the reader understand the artist and the art. For example, he explains the ancient Egyptian belief that images carry the soul, not by objectifying their primitive beliefs, but by suggesting an exercise by which the reader can discover that those feelings are commonplace within herself. He provokes (p. 40): “Suppose we take a picture of our favourite champion from today’s paper – would we enjoy taking a needle and poking out the eyes? Would we feel as indifferent about it as if we poked a hole anywhere else in the paper? I do not think so.” And so begins the dynamic struggle of emotion and reason that we follow through the history of art. This book impresses as much by its layout and editing as by the text and pictures themselves. Each of the many chapters begins with an architectural example. Since the text wisely refrains from tangents into cultural history, the architecture serves a second purpose (besides exemplifying preserved art) of adding practical context to the timeline. Then, each chapter ends with a small picture showing an artist from that time period at work. These little pictures are the only ones not actually referred to in the text, and again add non-text context, while bringing the reader closer to the artists. This approach succeeds in impressing the reader with the most important concepts in art history, since they are the ones that naturally recur throughout the story. The author frequently refers the reader to previous pictures (always giving the page number). Since the text is so brief, the reader, upon looking back at a previous picture, will also be reminded of the ideas expressed on that earlier page. Again, the author amplifies this learning effect by using consistent language and choosing pieces of art that will compliment each other. This model only breaks down in the final two chapters, which were added to later additions, about our contemporary art. The author has some worthwhile ideas about this topic, but writes too much. We can guess why this happened, and it does not detract much from the rest of the book. Finally, the backmatter contains a well-organized bibliography and timeline. As you can tell, I recommend this book. Even if, unlike myself, you already have a good knowledge of art history, I predict that you will appreciate this book. You may just read it a little faster."

Gombrich I was attracted to this beautiful little book in Waterstones; its wafer thin, smooth bible pages, section of over 400 rich colour plates and stylish, minimal cover design. I was also feeling a pang of guilt for not shopping in bookshops anymore because Amazon is so easy and cheap. Walking through a bookstore, perusing books and judging them by there covers, is a real pleasure and one we will be denied access to as everybody shops online, I am pretty sure we will see high street bookshops closing down soon unless they can figure out a way to compete with Amazon. So I bought The Storey of Art mainly because it’s so attractive but I also have a staggering lack of knowledge about art history - this looked like a good way to fill myself in. I read a quote recently that said if you read one hundred books on a subject you can call yourself an expert, it’s a bit daft but I have decided set myself a challenge; read 100 art books. This one has taken me about three months to read so expertise feels like a distant dream. It took so long beacuse I wanted to concentrate and take it all in, this book covers the whole of art history from early cave painting to post-modernism, that’s a lot of useful information, also, it’s not just reading the words but taking the time to look carefully at each image and it’s not the sort of book you can read in the bath or in bed because you have to keep refering back to plates. Fortunatley it is extremely accesable, intriguiging and keenly observing making it very readable and a little pleasure to indulge in. Being so ignorant of the subject, I loved that it took its time over periods and themes, referring back to them in the following chapters, revisiting artists and styles and giving in depth critical background to works such as stylistic influences and pressures on artists of different times. It strikes a perfect balence of being informative and comprehensive without becoming stifling; it is an insightful and rich overview. I am certain that I will actually be able to remember some of this information, I couldn’t have hoped for more from art book #1/100. So maybe walking into bookshops and judging books by their covers is a good strategy after all."

I'm giving it 5 stars, because it narrates the history of art in an engaging, digestible, colourful, and conversational manner in a way that brings the subject matter to life for a wide audience. I was riveted, absorbed, inspired, and left with a thirst to go out into the world and learn even more about art. That doesn't mean that I believe this is a perfect book. It looks at art from a Eurocentric perspective, only discusses ONE female artist (zero in the First Edition), and retains some phrasing that will seem culturally insensitive to the modern ear. Still, this book gave me a whole new appreciation for art. Not ALL art, I hasten to add. I remain unmoved by a lot of what Modern Art has to offer, and there are only so many renditions of ""Madonna with Child"" that one can view in an afternoon before they all start to blur together. But art appreciation is certainly a skill that can be developed with increased knowledge of intent, context, purpose, and technique. Now to read The Story of Art without men..."

In my opinion, the book is fabulously readable for two reasons: Every piece of art mentioned is shown in the book beside the text and the author avoids ""pretentious jargon"". I wish every art book followed just these two principles. While the European art from the Thirteenth to Nineteenth Centuries (the bulk of the book) eventually became a slog which threatened to make my eyes glaze over, this is no fault of Gombrich. Instead, he has given me a much greater appreciation of this time period. The art is so much more interesting against a backdrop of history and biography. True to the title, the book really does read like a story. It's not just a series of mind-numbing names, place, and dates. It's a seamless narrative of art over time.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The Story Of Art A good book to pair with this reading might be - Key Moments In Art, Lee Cheshire Gombrich surveys the history of art through the ages, incorporating the successive opinions, tastes, and works of art into one continuous story. His style of writing is easy and unassuming, assisted with many beautiful illustrations of paintings, sculptures, pottery, cave art, frescoes, and icons. From the ancient era to the modern era, Gombrich explains the current theories behind why and how early humans - hunters and gatherers - drew on the walls of the caves nearby their settlement, or crafted figurines and masks. The book is considered a seminal piece of work for any aspiring art student, and as such would serve as essential reading for anyone starting a journey in the realm of understanding works of art. As a starting point, Gombrich argues that our perception of art, and consequently our love for it, is often strangled by what we see from our own vision - haemorrhaged by our constant desire for all things realistic-looking. Rather, he argues, we should be asking of a piece, ""does it work?"" in the way the artist intended. He digs down on the ancient Egyptian era of art and investigates the hieroglyphs that proliferated the walls and tombs. What we at first may see as simple, two-dimensional and amateurish pictures, is really an indication of the artist's purpose. They saw hard-grafted stories and laws of their religion, alongside a set of beliefs, being followed. One example is that an Egyptian artist was known as ""he who keeps alive"", and as part of the tomb etchings an Egyptian would draw every part of the person in likeness, as they believed that would transfer into the afterlife - any such missing limb or foot from the hieroglyph is then assumed also to transfer into the afterlife - and so it became necessary that such bodies were contorted to preserve likeness of the soul. It was an old and tried tradition until Akhenaten, a pharaoh in the New Dynasty, tried to usurp and upset this stern style as it was a change from the multiple gods to one god and the sun rays, but by Tutankhamun's time Egyptian art reverted to its time-old tradition for a thousand more years. Art was thus at this point a form of function, rather than for pleasure. The Minoans and Myceneans shared in the Egyptian art until around 400BC, when Greek art became its own character. Eventually, the Greeks challenged the usual convention of styles and began with a technique called foreshortening on pottery showing their own mythological stories, when a hidden or shortened feature of a foot or arm of the body is still concealed in the picture. This was a striking and deliberate separation from the Egyptian understanding: where the Egyptians used their knowledge, the Greeks used their eyes. He also asserts that an art ""style"" is particularly hard to define except with when it is confined to certain laws, such as the law of perspective and law of diminution of distant objects. It is with the Hellenistic era of Greece and the Empire from Alexander the Great that art develops and becomes its own. No more were works of art done for tribal magic, religion worship, or myths. They start experimenting with capturing the expressions in faces, the idea of harmonised beauty in sculpturing the likeness of human bodies, and studying the fierce emotions and movements of the body - muscle, sinew, and bone all expressed in the marble. Dramatic scenes, such as from the sculpture Laocoon by Alegsander and Polydorus, show exquisite detail and is an exemplar of the ""Greek baroque"" style of the time. With the success of Alexander across the Hellenistic Empire, that skillset was shared across the known world. Where before, rigidity prevented artists to foreshorten, now limbs were being hidden and feet were shown in portrait, which to us would seem ludicrously plain but to them it was a huge step out of the normal circle, as before, it was a step into art for its own sake. It was also from this period that the wealthy and aristocratic class began to collect works of art for pleasure, or to have works of art copied, and privately owned. It demonstrates a markedly different perception of art, from the ancient Greece of Praxiteles to the Hellenistic Greece of Alexander. After Greece it was Rome, where Rome had at first imitated Grecian statues but advanced in civil engineering feats from inspiration. In likeness to Greek columns, the Romans implemented a heirarchy of classical arches from the construction of the wedge-shaped stones. This feat established a newly spectacular form of engineering, known as vaulted roof and dome constructions. Rome had become the epicentre of civil art and its aqueducts, colosseum, roman baths, roman roads, and roman arches and domes. ""Art"" had an unusual military connotation with the Roman Empire, with military strategies, tactics, training, and strength being as though a form of pleasure in the mind and body. The Dark Ages of the Early Middle Era, he explains, is typically referred to the time when the Roman Empire fell, and therefore is listed between AD500-1000, with the High Middle Era of the medieval period thereafter between AD1000-1400, until the Age of Discovery brought the Renaissance to light. This, he does, to then talk through the various movements and styles that emerged in these Ages. As such, Gombrich details the Gothic art movement emerging from the 11th Century - or also known as Norman art - and was dispersed across the world up to the 14th Century. It appeared to convey a sense of commanding power, sturdiness, steadfastness in its buildings with hard symmetrical geometric shapes, stained high-glass windows, as well as implementing traceries and pointed arches that reminisce Roman triumphant arches. During this period, painters began to express their work as a means of capturing the important message of the gospels or of Christ. Suddenly, we start seeing dynamic movements and stories squashed in one fresco, entablature, or sculpture; we see emphases on interest being from telling a sacred story to showing nature in its likeness - people being painted in likeness being an alien technique at this time. Giotto was given by Gombrich as a first-class example, who helped to catapult the arguably slacking Italian painters and sculptors into a new paradigm of work of art, who were taking influence from Byzantine art. Then come the Renaissance period of 15th-16th Centuries, split between Early- and High-Renaissance, meaning rebirth and rediscovering that art which the ancient Romans were involved with. This was the period of extraordinary gift from Donatello, Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Uccello, Francesca, Verrochio, and more. Sfumato was the new technique, an innovation of Da Vinci, that had the paintwork melting and mellowing the outlines within features of the flesh to create a naturally-flowing element, and became popular when noticed from the Mona Lisa painting. It was, however, in the merchant city of Florence where this new innovation was most intensely felt. Baroque art, the succeeding movement to the Renaissance between the 17-18th Centuries, cultivated a strong sense of ""grotesque"" or ""absurd"" techniques and visual details that had artists break away from the traditional classical and ancient Greco-Roman themes and forms. Gombrich brings the specific elements of Baroque art - the elegance, far-reaching, story-driven, emotionally-gripping, emphasis - to life by highlighting Caravaggio's work, Doubting Thomas. Baroque art is characterised by the play on light and shadow, supposedly also as a symbolic gesture of good and bad, and Caravaggio's Doubting Thomas provides a spectacular introductory spectacle of real provocation in both thought and action. Gombrich argues, and I also believe, that Caravaggio must have read the Bible again and again most vigorously to feel the essence of the spookiness, the dark macabre compared with the light salvation reality of the event, the position and posture of the scene as one looks-on as though witnessing it as one of the disciples, the shock of the protagonists, the truly grotesque nature of thrusting the finger in the side and feeling the fleshiness inside, as a point of call to faith. It was a step to exhibiting truth and sincerity, rather than harmony and beauty. All of these should incite a burst of emotion, reacting to the realness, that counteracted the Renaissance ideals of harmony and beauty of the Biblical events. As a point of understanding, Biblical works acted as more than just for the pleasure: they were situated or painted on altars, pews, on murals, on ceilings of churches, as frescoes or triglyphs; Madonnas and the Christ child were sculpted, the Nativity scene, and the Cross, all for new - and old - Christians to understand the stories in an interpreted and illustrated view rather than depending solely on the text, where failure to understand context and cross-reference might prove hard. Pope Gregory the Great once said, at the end of the sixth Century, ""Painting can do for the illiterate what writing does for those who can read"", and was instrumental in helping those against these daring portrayals of sacred beings to understand the benefits, and this line of thinking was prevalent up until the Reformation period of the 16th Century. During the time of the 1600s and 1700s, artists were experimenting with how to perfect techniques of their skills, some wanting to break away from the academic art seen as inadvertently haemorrhaging the freedom of artists to breakaway from perceived rules and laws of Art. Artists, on one hand, may have been delighted with the shift from depending on patrons who would often interfere with their intended works of art, bully them into adding or removing a detail. In saying this, however, what they delighted in losing, they dreaded in gaining another, more tyrannical ruler in nature - that is to say, the buying public, the bourgeois, the acquired taste. The common marketplace and public events were now the place aspiring artists had to go to sell their pieces, or depend on art and picture dealers. Competition now was very stiff. Competition was in fact so very stiff, that by the late 1800s a certain triumvirate of leading original artists - unbeknownst to themselves - would permanently change the world in its understanding of perceiving works of art. These artists would suffer in isolation, and endure condemnation, from the viewing public, and would never see or sniff an ounce of the successes their works would bring, that bore out of feelings of dissatisfaction with the production of art at the time, in particular to academic art. This dissatisfaction then propagated a vast array of new movements, immediately grasping attention to both public and student artist, and grew out new ideals and ways of conveying ideas on canvas. It began the era of what we now know as ""modern art"". These leaders of art, this triumvirate, was Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, and Paul Gauguin. From Van Gogh and his wholesomely bold impasto-style oil paintings provoking his own senses excitement and radically contrasting colours, Expressionism was born; from Cezanne and his determination to bridge the impressionist-style with his experimental use of small brushstrokes to form big fields of intensely bright colours, developing a craving for studying light and direct observation of landscapes, creating a collection of airy paintings, came Cubism; from Gauguin came the influence of the cloisonnist-style known as flat-faced painting, when paintings are void of particular light and shadow, and therefore it paved the way for Primitivism, a mode for recreating the aesthetic appeal of ancient antiquity paintings. One interesting point Gombrich had argued was that there is no such thing as ""Art"", in the sense of snobbery and pretentiousness that comes with an arrogant view of ""Art"", from an observer repeating fancy-sounding terminology and jargon in a museum whilst looking at a Boticelli or Van Eyck, but rather of works of art - where an artist suffers to translate their ideas on to canvas or marble until it is right to them - where we appreciate the mood and relationship between artist and canvas, irrespective of whether we like it or not: that it is rather more profitable to explore each painting in silence and understand it, than to half-know the art but act like you do. We may also be pleasantly surprised, he continues, that we might even prefer the scruffiness of a study sketch rather than a complete picture - and compares Albrecht Durer's painting of a rabbit, to Rembrandt's study of an elephant. The uncertain - perhaps somewhat ugly - scruffiness of the sketch, the excited free-flowing drawn lines capture the eye and it fills in the rest. These artists work to the point of perfection, when no other could add or change it to improve upon it. Overall, this book was a fantastic and easy read, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the works of art that have been produced throughout the ages, as one never finishes being a student of art. It is a story of the ages as told by its art and artists, favoured with extraordinary gift of persuasion and attention to detail, balancing shapes with colours and an imagination translated to canvas. His careful study of the illustrations and ensuring the reader understands his mind, the artists' mind, and what we should hopefully experience from the paintings is reassuring and humble."

I’ve learned so much and have a now a very global comprehension of the art’s development throughout history. It’s well written and very easy to read. It’s quite a long book but it covers most of the basics in one read so it’s very much worth it. Would totally recommend"
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I bought The Story of Art while about to leave Brugge, after a long week-end that was supremely friendly and quite artsy. I started reading this book as soon as I sat down in the train and was enchanted by it until the last page. 's is a masterful story of the main works and styles of art, from 30,000 BC until the 20th century. (The 16th edition includes material from up to around the late 1980s, in terms of art critique, and early 1970s, in terms of artworks.) The book is written from a Western (British) perspective but with enough mentions about Asian and African artworks to make the story global. The types of art covered here are chiefly architecture, picture, and sculpture. There are many things that I liked about this book, from its crisp analysis of artworks to the excellent rhetoric, the latter always in favor of art. The story covers mostly cave painting, ancient art, Greek and Hellenistic art, Roman and Byzantine art, Romanesque and Gothic art, Renaissance and Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo, Romanticism, and Modernism and Post-Modernism. Each style is illustrated with a selection of artworks, many of which are well-known to art beginners such as myself, all of which are discussed not only in terms of craft by also with regard to impact to the age and future art. The first artwork is usually an example of architecture, which is analyzed as a framing reference for smaller artifacts. Artworks from different ages and styles, but depicting similar topics, are compared tetually; I found very useful the detailed comparison references (e.g., ""examples of miniatures as page 211, figure 140, and page 274, figure 177""). There are numerous references to the actual quality of an artwork, which should create a very different impression from the in-book illustration; the book includes often details of the presented works, so that the reader is more easily able to understand its main characteristics. The book concludes with an analysis of art's future. I liked very much the warning that, in the 20th(-21st?) century, a real danger to art is the expectation of non-conformism---Gombrich mentions the ""tradition of the new"" of Harold Rosenberg. The book concludes with a number of additions to the 1950's first edition, and a set of useful editorial tools: an index of terms and works of art, a section of commented related work, a graphical representation of the periods and works of art covered in the main text. Among the main attractions of this book is it's deep yet understandable text. For example, I felt I could really understand the point raised by Gombrich in this paragraph: Among the things I would have liked to see improved in the book, perhaps the main element is the lack of discussion about other forms of art, from literary to performing art, from movies to computer gaming. Another rather negative point is the minimal coverage of Asian and African art, with only scant information and only some late inclusion the 20th century discovery of Greek, Chinese (Terra-Cotta Soldiers), and other artworks. I would have also been happy to see Gombrich's work continued, so that this 16th edition can take a more balanced look at Modernist and Post-Modernist art. One of the elements that turned out to be mostly negative was the detail with which the Modern and Post-Modern periods are covered. In the words of the author: Perhaps the memory of the by-stander, that is, the tendency to observe in more detail current rather than old events, motivates this over-description of material in these sections. Overall, a wonderful read for any art lover."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I decided to reread this after a twelve year gap to see if I would still be stuck with awe and wonder as I was the first time. The answer is yes. To encapsulate ""the story of art"" into one single book is an impossible task, so think of this book as ""a story of art"" written by a white man in the 1950's. He is an incredible knowledgeable and passionate man though, who is a wonderful guide for where to begin in the vast and often intimidating world of Art. Now that I have a tiny bit of footing into the art world, I enjoyed this book more, but was also increasingly acutely aware of the pitfalls of this and other such art- history books that cover large periods of time(in this case from the earliest cave art to the present day.) Having said that, what this book accomplishes is no small feat. Its no wonder this is considered such a classic. The biggest strength of this book is its use simple language, which is actually harder to do than it seems. Its easy to hide behind fancy rhetoric that often obfuscates rather than illuminates. Not a word is wasted and it all makes the most marvelous sense. Its other strength is that it does not mention any artwork in the text that it does not show in the book so the text never degenerates into a list of names that would mean nothing to one who is unacquainted with the work in question. This also leads to a very rigorous selection of artwork without crowding the book with the authors own favorites at the risk of excluding overused and familiar artworks. He states ""..it is meant for those who look for bearing in a new field, and for them the familiar appearance of apparently 'hackneyed' examples may serve as welcome landmarks."" Where it truly shines is that The story of Art teaches you how to look at art. Its like teaching a man to fish. For example, if you've ever looked at medieval art and dismissed it as crude, awkward and badly done this book will give you a pair of fresh eyes. Why was this art was being made? By whom? for whom? And to what end? These people knew how to draw(most of the time, looking at you Bayeux tapestry), but it wasn't important to the artist as long as all the symbols that were needed to get the message across were present. The idea was to communicate a message effectively and these paintings do that exceedingly well. He explains the idea through Egyptian art which we may dismiss as flat and 2-D but it was the symbolism and message of the art that mattered, there was no room for confusion. Everything had to be represented in its most characteristic angle, so the face in profile, the eye from straight ahead, as was the torso, and the limbs sideways again as they are best seen. These strict rules were followed by all Egyptian artists, they couldn't leave anything out, perhaps for magical purposes? You learn to look at art through the intentions of the artist which were often shaped by the period of history they inhabited. Because Art and Architecture are inextricably linked together there is a section in each chapter on the architectural developments of various periods which, though very brief, does round off the picture of the period really well as well as providing a great jumping off point for further inquiry. After all, most of this amazing painting and sculpture was made to be housed in actual buildings right? Also, it shows you how the ancient traditions in architecture have trickled down into modern times, there might be a piece of ancient Greek building tradition in your town! A second reading after a long gap is a richer and more enjoyable experience as I can now disagree with many of the opinions stated(oh the joys of being contrarian) since I have been exposed to alternate histories and interpretations. For example, did Titian really die of the plague at 99? apparently not. Is Giorgione's ""the tempest "" most likely just based on a Greek myth or was it more of a comment on society. Who knows, its all quite mysterious. In conclusion, anyone who has even a slight inkling towards the world of art and is looking for an accessible introduction will definitely find value in this book."

You can not write, or read, intelligently on all types of art, in all periods, all over the world with the same degree of appreciation or interest. Gombtrich's history is of course very Euro-centric and very old fashioned, in today's terms, in what is considered the 'important' areas in the history of art. But what he does write about is written intelligently and well. I am in two minds about this book, I don't really care of universal histories but if you are going to buy one then this is not bad, but how it would fare as text book today is impossible for me to say. If it gets someone in reading more, and exploring more art, of any type then it has done its job."

It is divided into 28 chapters, each which explains in detail a movement or period in art history. He covers most of the Big Names, although sometimes it feels as though he is trying to squeeze everything in. My main complaints are that it is very Western-centred and feels a little dated, and only includes ONE female artist, which feels like a massive oversight, particularly as he doesn’t even address the lack of female artists. Despite this, it’s a great book and really helped me to educate myself on a broad range of artists, periods and movements. Although it’s slightly dated, it remains a classic."

Gombrich isn't just an art historian,he's like a psychologist, I felt like I had a better understanding of why people were making all this funky contemporary art; even if I still don't necessary like or understand it, at least I kind of feel I see where it's coming from. Really a great book if you want a basic intro to the history of art."

Naturally the presumption to offer a monolithic story of art is absurd - but this particular story is well worth sharing."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Gombrich provides a comprehensive history of art from early primitive works to the end of the second world war. This book provides an overview to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for art by understanding how it has developed throughout human history. He eloquently describes works created by the great masters in a loving and cherished diction, providing a soothing and pleasurable read. There are certain periods of art history that I do not find as interesting, which caused certain chapters of books to be slower reads. That being said, the book does a great job of achieving its purpose: to provide a high level overview of the entirety of Art History for the lay reader. The book can best be summarized by Gombrich's introduction, ""People who have acquired some knowledge of art history are sometimes in danger of falling into a similar trap.. When they see a work of art they do not stay to look at it, but rather search their memory for the appropriate label. They may have heard that Rembrandt was famous for his - which is the Italian technical term for light and shade - so they nod wisely when they see a Rembrandt, mumble 'wonderful ' and wander on to the next picture. I want to be quite frank about this danger of half-knowledge and snobbery, for we are all apt to succumb to such temptations, and a book like this could increase them. I should like to help open eyes, not loosen tongues. To talk cleverly about art is not very difficult, because the words critics use have been employed in so many different contexts that they have lost all precision. But to look at a picture with fresh eyes and to venture on a voyage of discovery into it is far more difficult but also much more a rewarding task. There is no telling what one might bring home from such a journey."" (18)"

It was easy-reading – staying conversational and not getting too in-depth with the facts. It also had a lot of photos, which is a huge plus for me. As I got deeper into the book, however, the author had to reference way too much among the previous pages to make for easy reading. In the end, I can’t say this is anything more than a good textbook for a high school or college course. I like to casually read about art, but this became more than casual in approach. Not a bad book, just not exactly what I was looking for."

Particularly helpful are the references to works mentioned in previous pages or chapters and includes page numbers for easy browsing. Wish the man lived longer and kept updating the book with new chapters for each past decade. Saying that it is highly recommended is stating the obvious.

As a result of this it's not that easy to pick up, read, and consistently return to. I'm also happy to have one of the later editions of the book, as the chapters at the end offer interesting insight into art criticism and art historians. Honestly, I found this post script more enjoyable to read than some of the other sections of the book, which maybe means that I've been reading the wrong kind of art book. Either way, happy to have finished it as it serves as a great contextual jumping-off point if I ever wanted to explore any art movement more in depth. Worth the read."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In all honesty, I should have read this book before I even entered college or changed my major from journalism to art history, but now I am a college graduate, entering a Renaissance art graduate program, and I figured I needed some concise background information, so I decided to finally read this quite excessively long book. Gombrich does an excellent job summing up ancient and medieval art— I had never learned much about it in my undergraduate courses other than from the influence of Apollo Belvedere or Venus de Milo or Laocoon & His Sons on the artwork of the Renaissance, and I appreciated how he made it readable and understandable. When I got to the Renaissance, I got a little annoyed at some of the assumptions and implications that Gombrich wrote into the book— a lot of this didn’t seem like things I had learned in the Renaissance courses I have taken. The modern chapters (after Impressionism) were where I really got tripped up— this book was originally written in 1950, and of course Gombrich had no idea at the time that some artists working before that year would eventually become world renowned (and he even acknowledges this many times in his afterword) but the way he wrote in this chapter seemed uneven and not in line with how he discussed ancient and Renaissance art— almost like he was saying “All right well I guess I have to talk about this now.” Another thing I did not care for were how Gombrich would devote tiny tiny paragraphs to an artist, in any time period, who is now quite moderately well known, would then direct you to a sample of their artwork in the back of the book (and never even their best or most famous piece of artwork) and then move on. Why even include this random interlude if it’s better for you to just give us an overview? Ultimately I really appreciated how this book tied up a lot of loose ends for me before I begin my art history graduate program; Gombrich almost seamlessly ties the entire history of art from ancient Greeks to modern times and even though everything in me thinks that this is almost impossible, well, then Gombrich achieved the impossible. There is so much more to be said about the history of art, even at an introductory level, and sometimes I personally believe that Gombrich spent too much time on the wrong things. But in the end I’m glad I read this, and if you’re thinking of studying the history of art in college, read this and John Berger’s Ways of Seeing beforehand for a good head start."

Still, up to and including the beginning of the 20th Century, it's a fascinating read, and contains a wonderful history that charts most of the major movements and gives a great overview of how different sections of western art relate to each other. As the 20th Century progresses, however, one gains the impression that Gombrich loses heart somewhat, and the last sections of the book turn into little more than a lament at the direction in which art is heading. This leads to strange exclusions from the book (Pollock is in there, and Pop Art is rapidly dismissed, but Bacon and Rothko are entirely ignored). Still, it's a book that's remained essential reading for over half a century for a good reason, and it's well worth looking into."

Gombrich combines an encyclopedic knowledge about Art with his unique “anti-encyclopedic” insights: all the time he calls our attention to what’s really going on, how things connect to each other, the precise aspect that’s really important - and interesting - to take away, and so in. The introduction alone is a full journey into Art. I love that he chose the word “Story” instead of “History”: it’s all about the humans behind the works, starting with the very first phrase of the book: “THERE really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.” An awesome book to read as a story, and come back to, over and over. P.S.: his “history for kids” book is also awesome!"

Gombrich knows that what we humans recognize are patterns and a story is a pattern of information. We like them so much, we even learn them for fun. He uses the story format to convey a sense of consistency throughout the things he's trying to get across and succeeds in making his readers retain that knowledge."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I have heard of this book for some time but was always intimidated by its volume. At the start of this year, when I was strolling around in Cambridge, a place with lots of dear memory, I found a second-hand version of this book, with a flyer for a Degas exhibition inside. Opening the book that night at the hotel, the scent of old books struck me and I immediately indulged in the book. Five stars would be too few for this book. I wish I had started this book sooner - even before I knew this book. I wish I had read this in my early year of high school. It might have changed my life forever. Well, I think it has certainly changed me a lot during these several months. History is not my thing - I changed high school because I wouldn't need to study history in my new school. I have always found history dull and historians' fixation on years and meaning boring. However, this book on art history is educating and beautiful at the same time. I have rarely come across books and articles with such language as clear flowing water while stating the points clearly. The style of the language is a little bit old-school, which is a good thing in my view. Nowadays authors are no longer writing in such a modest but graceful way. I was touched deeply several times in my read. It wasn't because I was made sad, it was purely touching. The words and the images just stirred my emotion somehow. It was simply the power of art, I think. “There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists - men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful fit of balancing shapes and colours till they are ‘right’, and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work. Artists, we trust, will always be born. But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.” I came to tears when I read this. So many thoughts and memory came into my mind. I recall the time when I was happily doodling with my crayons, when my grandfather drew the scene of his childhood memory when we had projects about different art styles, when my art teachers patiently guided me through the steps of calligraphy arts, when I first came to the UK and visit the National Gallery with my friends… I wish I have more encounters with arts, I wish I had started sooner, but it’s never too late to start appreciating and reflecting. By talking about Art in such an engaging way, this book is a piece of art itself. Getting close to the end of the book, a rush of sadness came into me, and I couldn’t wait to read it again and again."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Just got through the last 4 chapters of the book and found myself so into it. I had never known that history book can be as captivating as this one. The narrative style is great, which helps to make sense of all the ambiguous events and movements in the history of art. I would give Sir Gombrich 5 stars for his talent of clarify things. This book is a helpful resource of radical explanations and supportive examples which helps me to strenthen my arguments on my crtitical analysis. It aims at answering my greatest concern toward the history of art: ""In which standard we define art ?"" All the examples were refered to this book. .. Inspecting the history of art from the nineteenth century, I am coming up with a very basic question: ""In which standard we define art ? Or is there a standard or a necessity to form ?"". As most art debates has no end and a question always provokes an infinite sequence of many other ones, I failed to determine a yes or no answer after the research but found it able to present several arguments. In the earlier period of time, the art standard was mainly set by artworks showing supreme skills of from leading masters, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Ruben, Goya,.. As there was an inevitable agreement on the level of excellence in their artworks, the definition of art at that time was concrete to define. However, the perception of art had changed so far that artistic expertise had no longer been judged merely by the objective supreme painting skills but by subjective approach. While the old school art theory presents an objective standard with definition of line, form, shape, color to define art value, the new school states that art is wholly subjective which determine a mean to expressing individuality. By this theory, artwork is evaluated through its capacity to impact viewer emotionally, psychologically, physically and spiritually. Though each school of thoughts present its drawback, does what matters just which school of thought that we choose to embrace ? The old school criticism prompts people to categorize art as orthodox art vs unorthodox art, low art vs high art, art vs non-art etc. It is needless to indicate the obsoleteness of the old-school objective criticism, which was confirmed in every period of the art development. The first reason is that most artists in every period had the great tendency to break the tradition. For instance,I take an insignificant but particular example of Edouard Manet (1832- 1883), one of the avant-garde who started the art revolution in French. By examining the traditional convention in painting of his time, he discovered that the whole claim of it was wholly based on misconception of shade and light, which made the representation of object in traditional art at that time very artificial. That said, the emergence of all art movements were fostered by the courage of artists to fearlessly examine the traditional convention, the quarrel they endured with the preceding masters and the desire of escaping from the deadlock that they found themselves in. Therefore, using objective convention from tradition to measure art can be improper. The second reason is that any definition on which we rely to evaluate art have been disparate through time. For instance, even the most successful art movement, French Impressionism was substantially rejected by not only critics but all section of public in its beginning. Impressionist’s painting was once thought to be mad and unorthodox because the viewers claimed they saw nothing in those paintings except a confusion of brushstroke. For a century later, since we extol Impressionism as the legend for innovation in art that moved art away from the precise imitation of reality to the representation of what we really see things, it is hard for us to understand why Impressionist had met such rejection at that period. But it is a considerable example for how definition of orthodox art differs over different period of time. Since, it is unavoidable to state every objective standard formed will soon be replaced by another one. On the other hand, the subjective approach to art criticism results in the likeliness to mislead the evaluation of art. There are many modern artworks which are personally hard to understand. They are, for example, the Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings of dripping paint, the Black Square(1915) by Malevich or the Fountain of Marcel Duchamp(1917). Since I am clueless to find the level of supreme skills in the creation of these works labelled as art, I find the necessity to rely on the new school of thought to define the artistic value in those works. However, owing to the subjectivity, it is likely to use the new school of thought as an excuse for poor artistic skill and an exhaustion of creativity. Hence there is a tendency that the art value is exaggerated by critics, while the artists’ attempt might only is to shock the public and stand out. Since there is no concrete standard to judge, the art evaluation leaves a huge gap of ambiguity. Art is both unnecessary and unable to be standardized The perception to art considerably fluctuates. Gombrich stated that artists only mission is to create things, which had never existed before. That explains why artist always struggle to break the tradition, seek for new problem and solution for unsolved issue. I take Paul Cezanne as an example. As the current Impressionism had gained a complete triumph in making a conquest of nature, Cezanne decided that there would be no gain to pursue that movement further; then he tried to start everything from scratch again, seeked for new problems and struggled to solved it. Thanks to his endeavour, new possibilities in art had been explored which fostered the new art movement in the early 20th century. That said, it is impossible to standardize art. Due to the perpetual finding of new problems to solve, artists always dissatisfied with the current standard. Since Cezanne felt the loss of the sense of order and balance; Van Gogh felt art lost the sense of intensity and passion; Gauguin dissatisfied with current life and art; their struggle to find solution urge to the start of three new movements, respectively Cubism, Expressionism and Primitivism. Gombrich also indicated that the modern art we see today mostly grew out from the feelings of dissatisfaction that is just mentioned. Once again, the art history proved the unnecessity of such art standard as well as the impossibility to form an art definition because every standard established will be soon intentionally challenged and altered. “ Art history is a weaving and changing of tradition, in which each works refer to the past and point to the future.” There is no such thing as art. There are only people willing to undergo the long run of finding solution for new coming problems who are labelled as artists (Gombrich, 2006). And then what makes their works differentiated is how long their value remained to be praised through time. The continual emergence of new perception in art is a great stimulation for the new possibilities."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Enjoy it for What It Is... I was recommended this book as somebody who knew nothing about art. And I struggle to imagine a better presented introduction to this vast topic. The author states in the fifteenth edition preface ‘In writing [this book] I thought first and foremost of readers… who had just discovered the world of art for themselves.’ And I felt he guided me through the labyrinth in a straight line. The book presents a chronological story. ‘The story’ begins with some of the earliest known examples of cave images. It continues through ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and China before continuing its predominant focus on Europe until reaching the present day. It touches on the influence of art on these societies and the influence of these societies on art. Methods and trends are also touched on. And on occasion it links generations of artists’ stories together such as Leonardo to Michelangelo to Raphael. It contains illustrations throughout. These illustrations are referred to by the text. I think criticisms of this book come when one takes it out of context. Any criticism I have heard, always from a connoisseur, can be summarized in one sentence: A more accurate title would be ‘A Story of Predominately Western Art’. However, if this book is taken as the author intended it to be, one will struggle to find any book that better achieves such an ambitious intention."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"It is a pleasure to read story of art -some part of it as the focus is European art - as a continuous weaving of many creators, disobedient minds , sometimes heretics and changers of traditions , challenging the past with dissatisfaction and pointing the future with an inevitable end to be challenged as a past chapter of the story. It is still provocative after many years , although it may be classified as an introductory book , for thoughts about the question of what art is or whether there is something called art or there is just artist as Gombrich wrote at the introduction of the book . Then the questions : all this is about what ? Mimesis, expression , kind of construction of another realm , just something new ? It is good to have these questions in mind while going through the centuries behind the stories of many artists looking for ways to create , express, challenge. Probably the pleasure was endorsed as I read the copy from 1950 , third edition which has been at my library for last 30 years waiting to be read. As art is a shelter against the dismay, these Pandemic days was probably time to read it."

I started looking at buildings with different eyes. I started analyzing all the museums I've been to and all the paintings I've seen. I was calling my friends in the middle of the night to ask them if they knew something I read and seemed so logical and yet we haven't thought about it. This book is amazing for people who desire a brief introduction into Arts and need something to start with. What I missed (and even the author has a long ""disclaimer"" about it) was more info and appreciation on Contemporary Art. I understand why it is difficult to write about something happening now and I understand there are a large number of artists to pick from. But nevertheless I felt Gombrich does not really appreciate Contemporary Art. I was disappointed about his presentation on Surrealism but as I kept reading I understood his point of view. That being said, the book is a fantastic introduction into visual arts up to Surrealism. After that point everything is open for debate :)"

And exceedingly good book, circumventing the jargon and pompousness of art historians, it illustrates the history - and story - of art in a most down-to-earth manner, clearly and concisely. For the uneducated reader as myself, it was an unparalleled reading. I guess the most striking element is Prof. Gombrich's ascetic take, to only mention and explore works of art contained in the book, discerning with clarity their composition, which techniques were employed in their creation, and above all, how their story interlaced, what changes came with the years, the problems of each generation, the composers and artists who tackled them - who succeeded, and why."

Gombrich has a very classic and smooth style of writing about Art. He summarized the history of art from the ancient era into contemporary in 27 chapters. Followed by a chapter that revealed his approach towards visual art. The writer picked some of the most distinguished paintings in each era, which crystalized the main figures and approach of drawings then. The book is writing in a first person narrator as a story to be retold unlike the documentaries books. Moreover, it has a plenty of visual art and paintings revealing the schools of art followed by a detailed timeline and a map to follow the era were discussed in the book.

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"What a tremendous resource for learning about art - and instantly an all-time favorite book of mine. The narration is engaging and accessible, and the setup of this edition (with text in front and illustrations arranged in back) made it easy to follow along and study each exhibit. I gained a real appreciation for the overall ’story of art’ - the themes at play and problems and solutions faced by and encountered by art in various historical and social contexts - as well as fantastic introductions to many significant artists. The original book was published shortly after WW2, and since then Gombrich added several additional intro and conclusion sections in subsequent editions, which can be found here and serve as nice time capsules. The central takeaways of this book for me are 1) there is no art without artists 2) the story of art is a nonlinear one without any defined endpoint, with plenty of zigs and zags, as solutions are devised to solve problems which then open up new problems 3) art requires some societal/historical motivational core (the grain at the center of a pearl) to thrive. * Primitive art - drawing faces from individual shapes; evolution from there to new types of art was not about advances in technology, but changes in ideas (of what should be depicted and how) * Egypt - particular style of painting, everything follows set laws (depicting human body parts in different ways / planes based on how they were best conveyed rather than how they appeared) - little evolution over time (until Tut, new ways of depicting); sacred purpose of portraits in tombs. Painting from knowledge. * Greek revolution: bursts of creativity, adherence to Egyptian technique combined with freedom to deviate from sacred rules on human form; beginnings of foreshortening; Athenian democracy ~ evolving identity of artists; paintings / statues alongside poems and plays as things to discuss. Portraits evolved later in Greek era - sculptures of Alexander. * Hellenistic art - Greek civilization spread via Alexander, into ‘Hellenistic’ world. Art became intentionally more impressive (Corinthian columns evolving from Doric/Ionic). Rich people collecting art made artists more important; prevalence of art in Pompeii (an otherwise ordinary provincial town in Hellenic world) illustrates this evolution * Rome - borrowing things they liked from Greece; triumphal arches / columns (influenced sacred depictions in Jewish, Indian art) * Religion and art - what can / should be depicted? Pope Gregory - art educates the illiterate and has important purpose * Major significance of Byzantine art - images as holy, maintained old eastern / Egyptian traditions and fused to religious art - preserved traditions for later eras, provided bridge to Renaissance * Middle ages / dark ages * Local tribal art fused with Christianity * Egyptians painted what they knew; Greeks what they saw; Middle Ages what they felt (religious depictions convey this). Middle Ages survival bias - religious art lasted, privately owned art destroyed * Evolution of Norman / Romanesque architecture styles. Gothic - extension of Romanesque, greater use of arches, expanding into stained glass. Gothic art - methods of art as means to end, of telling sacred stories better * Giotto (Florence 13th century) - begins era of artist as part of history of art; first artist to harness Hellenistic technique preserved by Byzantines, add creativity, and transform Gothic lifelike sculpture into painting * International style (14th century) - Italian (kept Byzantine art alive) and French ideas spread across Europe; depicting nature became important -> depicting humans accurately -> renewal of classical styles * Renaissance - key pillars: 1) scientific / mathematical perspective 2) close observation of nature / understanding of human anatomy 3) learning from antiquity / classical forms of sculpture, architecture, art * Early Renaissance pioneers: Brunelleschi, Donatello (architecture, sculpture) * Northern vs Southern Renaissance: Italian art began with scientific perspective / outlines / understanding of body; Dutch added detail upon detail to resemble reality (van Eyck - oil painting) * High Renaissance in Florence / Rome - changing status of artist, determination to be more than craftsman, equal with scholar or poet. Leonardo - use of science to elevate painting above humble art; sfumato technique - blurring of outlines + mellow colors allowing merging of forms, leaving more to viewer’s imagination. Michelangelo - papal commissions, extended Leonardo’s focus on human body and emphasized this exclusively, accurate painting of form. Raphael - ‘idea of beauty’, simplicity of Madonnas, fluidity of bodies in motion. * Venice - Titian, expert handling of paint - allowed to break rules of composition (position of virgin etc) and make up for it with colors. Bellini, Correggio - use of color and light to balance forms. Importance of color in Venice, influenced by eastern linkages. * Spread into north. Durer - studied in southern Europe and traveled to Venice as artist; combined northern (earlier Gothic) style (nature, extreme detail) with Italian Renaissance ideals of beauty - to tell sacred stories. Bosch - synthesis of old (primal fears, depictions of evil) with new (methods of portraying) * Later Renaissance - crises of art in 16th century; idea that art had reached perfection in Renaissance, so what to do next? * Mannerism (imitation of Michelangelo), Parmigiano, Cellini - quest for unusual / interesting even at expense of natural beauty (modern) * Southern art: Tintoretto - legacy of Titian painting, fused with mystery - feel thrill and tension of drama (St Mark’s remains, St George / dragon). El Greco - Spanish mysticism, also realist portraiture * Reformation challenges in north - outlawing of religious imagery removed major market for art. Great artists left for England - Holbein the Younger - portraits of masterly restraint painted at Henry VIII court. Dutch art survived Reformation best - genre paintings, follies of everyday life - Bruegel the Elder * 17th century: Baroque / neoclassical art, following from Greco / Tintoretto (complicated compositions, showcasing light and color) * Rome: schools of Caracci v Caravaggio. Caracci - classical scenes, beauty, inspiration by Raphael - development of neoclassical style (influenced Reni, Poussin, Lorrain - who influenced later landscape painters). Caravaggio - naturalism, faithful looks at nature, truth over beauty - unafraid to paint ugliness of reality. * Rubens - synthesis of Caracci (classical scenes) with Caravaggio (naturalism) and Flemish/Dutch tradition (not focused on standards of beauty, attention to detail). Ability to make scenes (large scale or portraits) come to life in ‘painterly’ way. * Artists influenced by Rubens. Van Dyck - painter at court of Charles I, elegant portraits of royals. Velásquez - court of Philip IV in Spain, learned from Italy - inspired initially by Caravaggio, then by Rubens and Titian; forerunner of Impressionism, capturing real moments (Las Meninas) * Protestant Northern Europe: changing marketplace post-Reformation; commission practice ending, so artists had to sell art to public, leading to greater specialization. Growing embrace of idea of ‘picturesque’ landscapes. Rembrandt - etchings, inspired by Caravaggio; self portraits, portraits - sense of being face to face with real people, illustrating depth of souls, displaying ability to understand all types of men; light and shade used to enhance scene’s drama. Still lifes - subject became incidental to importance of painting. Vermeer, still lifes with people - unique contrast of mellowness / precision * 18th century: peak of Baroque art/architecture around 1700 * Versailles as epitome of baroque styling (without baroque approach would be monotonous); boom in similar palaces and monasteries around Europe. Decline in importance of individual arts - art focused on building these grand spaces. * England. St Paul’s - baroque or not? Restrained, Italian Renaissance styling, church as place for contemplation not otherworldly vision. Country house > palace; classical stylings that don’t break rules; legacy of Claude Lorrain. Hogarth - moral tales in engravings. Reynolds (founded Royal Academy) vs Gainsborough; parallel to Caracci/Caravaggio. Reynolds - favored imitation of Italian Renaissance masters (similar thinking to Caracci), elevation of painting as intellectual pursuit, importance of painter’s ideas; paintings sometimes a bit labored. Gainsborough - simplicity, nature as teacher, straightforward portraits emphasizing good brushwork, and landscapes. * New directions around French Revolution: growing collector taste for novelty; shift from old ways of teaching to academies (created new crises of lack of interest in new art vs old, and unsubtle works at academy shows); embrace of older styles (Classical Greek, Gothic) in favor of baroque / rococo / neoclassical architecture in US. * Portrayal of recent history and heroic figures with lessons for present - Copley, Jacques-Louis David. Goya - portraits in style of old masters (Van Dyck ) with artistic skill of Titian, but new eyes and lack of flattery. Romantic poetry spilling into painting - painting from inner vision, Goya and Blake. * Popularity of landscapes - 2 camps in England. Turner - obsessed with improving on traditions (Claude Lorrain) - motion and complexity, human emotion reflected in nature. Constable - no need for trickery, honest simplicity best - don’t outshine nature. * 19th century: industrial revolution, mass production, decline in public taste - conflict between artists and public, split between artists doing ‘official’ work and those outside mainstream. Paris as center of art world. * France: Ingres (conservative painter following David, technical smooth perfection) vs Delacroix (movement, excitement of a scene). Corot as a bridge in approaches: capture truth in general forms / tones - achievements of palette (use of colors harmonized with gradation of tone). Barbizon school - following Constable, seeing nature with fresh eyes; Millet - landscape approach taken to figures; Courbet - realism a la Caravaggio. Rossetti, pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, truth over beauty - artistic dead end? * Impressionism - beginning of idea of art as studying/solving particular problems. Manet - revolution in depicting colors; classical masters of color as inspiration (Titian, Velásquez, Goya); illusion of depth via simple flat forms. Monet - painting in front of motif rather than studio; technological changes e.g rapid strokes and no time to mix paints, effect of whole over specific details. Renoir - inspired by crowd scenes (following Jan Steen), but shifted focus onto effect of light. Degas - ballet, unexpected angles used to study space / forms; objective / dispassionate (interest in movement / space, not in beauty of subject). Rodin - unfinished looking works. Contributing factors to development of Impressionism: 1) photography (art needed to evolve new aims) 2) Japanese woodblock prints becoming prevalent and introducing new ideas of perspective / completeness. Ideas around Impressionism - ideas of finishedness (borrowed from Rembrandt - artist’s right to declare when finished); overcoming knowledge of form as obstacle to enjoyment. * Late 19th century: triumph of Impressionism, what next? 3 post impressionist masters - dissatisfied in different ways, led to new traditions of modern art. Shared willingness to sacrifice correctness of outlines to accomplish different aims. None of these artists were well-known/understood in their times. * Cezanne - felt order/balance lost in Impressionist messiness; sought reconciliation of methods of Impressionism (paint what one saw) with balance/harmony (‘paint Poussin from nature’); influenced Cubism * Van Gogh - felt intensity / passion of art was lost in focus on visual impression. Brushstrokes to convey artist’s excitement (flamelike strokes); influenced Expressionism * Gauguin - dissatisfied generally with life and art, aimed for simplicity through exploration of native culture; influenced Primitivism * Modern art. Influence of architecture - Bauhaus, functionalism. Extension of ideas of what painter should paint - paint what he sees? We can’t separate what we see from what we know. * Expressionism - painting of feelings, Munch’s scream; focus not just on pleasant things. Abstract art - Kandinsky first to paint without recognizable object. * Fauvism - Matisse, 1900s Paris. Decorative simplification, use of colors. Cubism, Picasso - problems of form; one solution to essential tension in art (depth on surface), experiments in modeling; recognizable objects, pictures made of uniform parts so whole looks consistent in spite of unfamiliarity. Return to Egyptian principles of painting from knowledge of objects. Klee - new possibilities of forms, nature creates through artist; artist creates something new rather than replicating reality. * Primitivism - lasting effects of Gauguin, theme that influenced much later art - quest for native/childlike simplicity - Rousseau, Chagall, Wood. Surrealism - Freudian inspiration, dreamscapes; Magritte (self portrait of artist creating new reality), Dali. Pollock, start of AbEx - unifying two strands 1) childlike simplicity / spontaneity 2) sophisticated interest in problems of painting * What drives art? Core task set by community / society; always new challenges to pursue even as art evolved, new solutions led to new challenges. Modern art - prevalence of old/new theories provide core impetus for art’s evolution."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In the good old days, a young man would go on a grand tour in order to visit the remains of classical civilization in Italy and Greece. As an aristocrat, one could expect to gain admittance to fine private collections in the possession of the leading families in each locality and, not only that, to be regaled with lectures on them by resident experts. What can one do to further his self-education these days in an era of lesser culture? By serendipity, at the public library of late this recensionist happened upon the present work by the noted art historian E.H. Gombrich, (Phaidon, originally published in 1950 and most recently reprinted in 2022), which promises to go a long way towards making up the gap for us, less favored contemporaries. The text in this pocket edition, with all the additions accumulated in later editions comes to 502 pages along with an appendix collecting the 413 illustrations, most in color. A glance at the table of contents shows how rich is the fare on offer here: 1 strange beginnings; 37, art for eternity (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete); 49, great awakening (Greece to 5th c); 63, realm of beauty (Greece to 1st c. ad); 81, world conquerers (Romans, Buddhists, Jews, Christians to 4 th c); 93, A parting of ways (Rome and Byzantium, 5th to 13th c.); 103, Looking eastwards (Islam, China 2nd c to 13th c); 111, Western art in the melting pot (Europe, 6th to 11th c.); 119, Church militant (12th c); 129, Church triumphant (13th c.); 139, courtiers and burghers (14th c.); 155, conquest of reality (early 15th c.); 167, tradition and innovation I (Italy later 15th c.); 183, tradition and innovation II (15th c. in north); 201, harmony attained (early 16th c.); 215, light and color (Venice early 16th c.); 247, new learning spreads (Germany and Netherlands early 16th c.); 257, crisis of art (Europe later 16th c.); 273, vision and visions (Catholic Europe 16th c.); 293, mirror of nature (Holland 17th c.); 315, power and glory I (Italy 17th - 18th c.); 331, power and glory II (France, Germany, Austria 17th to 18th c.); 339, age of reason (England and France 18th c.); 347, break in tradition (England, America, France 18th to 19th c.); 361, permanent revolution (19th c.); 379, in search of new standards (late 19th c.); 411, experimental art (first half 20th c.); 429, a story without end (465-502). Let us reproduce a few striking quotations in order to illustrate Gombrich’s style: It is true that some artists or critics in certain periods have tried to formulate laws of their art; but it always turned out that poor artists did not achieve anything when trying to apply these laws, while great masters could break them and yet achieve a new kind of harmony no one had thought of before. [pp. 31-32] Egyptian painters had a very different way from our of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artist’s task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. [pp. 51-52] It is this balance between an adherence to rules and a freedom within the rules which has made Greek art so much admired in later centuries. [pp. 72-73] But the forms which the artists used in this new attempt were not the simple forms of primitive art, but the developed forms of Greek painting. Thus Christian art of the Middle Ages became a curious mixture of primitive and sophisticated methods. [pp. 106-107] As we look at the mosaics done by these Greek artists in the Balkans and in Italy in the Middle Ages, we see that this Oriental empire had in fact succeeded in reviving something of the grandeur and majesty of ancient Oriental art, and in using it for the glorification of Christ and his power. [p. 109] Buddhism influenced Chinese art not only by providing the artists with new tasks. It introduced an entirely new approach to pictures, a reverence for the artist’s achievement such as did not exist either in ancient Greece or in Europe up to the time of the Renaissance. The Chinese were the first people who did not think of the making of pictures as a rather menial task, but who placed the painter on the same level as the inspired poet. [pp. 113-114] That is, perhaps, how religious art in China came to be employed less for telling the legends of the Buddha and the Chinese teachers, less for the teaching of a particular doctrine – as Christian art was to be employed in the Middle Ages – than as an aid to the practice of meditation. Devout artists began to paint water and mountains in a spirit of reverence, not in order to teach any particular lesson, nor merely as decorations, but to provide material for deep thought….The Chinese, therefore, consider it childish to look for details in pictures and then to compare them with the real world. They want, rather, to find in them the visible traces of the artist’s enthusiasm. [pp. 114-115] In pictures like these we see the emergence of a new medieval style which made it possible for art to do something that neither ancient Oriental nor classical art had done: the Egyptians lad largely drawn what they to exist, the Greeks what they ; in the Middle Ages the artist also learned to express in his picture what he . [p. 124] There was naturally more contact than formerly with the art of Byzantium, and many artists of the twelfth century tried to imitate and emulate the majestic sacred images of the Eastern Church. At no other time, in fact, did European art approach the ideals of this kind of Eastern art more closely than at the height of the Romanesque style. [p. 134] Painting was indeed on the way to becoming a form of writing in pictures; but this return to more simplified methods of representation gave the artist of the Middle Ages a new freedom to experiment with more complex forms of composition (composition = putting together). Without these methods the teachings of the Church could never have been translated into visible shapes. [pp. 135-136] We have just compared the art of the Romanesque period with the art of Byzantium and even of the ancient Orient. But there is one respect in which Western Europe always differed profoundly from the East. In the East these styles lasted for thousands of years, and there seemed no reason why they should ever change. The West never knew this immobility. It was restless, groping for new solutions and new ideas. The Romanesque style did not even outlast the twelfth century. [p. 139] But for all that, it may be useful to remember that in real history there are no new chapters and no new beginnings, and that it detracts nothing from Giotto’s greatness if we realize that his methods owe much to the Byzantine masters, and his aims and outlook to the great sculptors of the northern cathedrals….Nothing like this had been done for a thousand years. Giotto had rediscovered the art of creating the illusion of depth on a flat surface. For Giotto this discovery was not only a trick to be displayed for its own sake. It enabled him to change the whole conception of painting. Instead of using the methods of picture-writing he could create the illusion that the sacred story was happening before our very eyes….Giotto’s method is completely different. Painting, for him, is more than a substitute for the written word. We seem to witness the real event as if it were enacted on a stage….From his day onwards the history of art, first in Italy and then in other countries also, is the history of the great artists. [pp. 150-153] To see and observe nature with ever-fresh eyes, to discover and enjoy ever-new harmonies of colors and lights, had become the essential task of the painter. In this new zeal, the great masters of Catholic Europe found themselves at one with the painters on the other side of the political barrier, the great artists of the Protestant Netherlands. [p. 313] In earlier periods it was usually the leading masters, artists whose skill was supreme, who also received the most important commissions and therefore became very famous. Think of Giotto, Michelangelo, Holbein, Rubens or even Goya. This does not mean that tragedies could never occur or that no painter was ever insufficiently honored in his country, but by and large the artists and their public shared certain assumptions and therefore also agreed on standards of excellence. It was only in the nineteenth century that the real gulf opened between the successful artists – who contributed to ‘official art’ – and the nonconformists, who were mainly appreciated after their death. The result is a strange paradox. Even today there are few specialists who know much about the ‘official art’ of the nineteenth century. [p. 384] Another attractive feature of Gombrich’s study is the clarity with which he traces the emergence and subsequent development of themes throughout the history of art. A sampling of these would include the following: 1) How the position of the artist changed during the nineteenth century – may we draw a parallel with the natural sciences today? For just as the artist in the nineteenth century became increasingly set loose from the need to depict customary subject matters, so too in our times in theoretical physics, scientists have become unmoored from the requirement to connect their ideas closely with experiment, leading to a subjective style that the commentator John Horgan calls post-modern or ‘ironic science’. 2) Remarking upon this development in the art world, Gombrich declares that ‘the idea that the true purpose of art was to express personality could gain ground only when art had lost every other purpose’ [p. 384] – resembling somewhat how, around the same time, existentialism emerges in philosophy, for only those who have received no character of their own from their upbringing are attracted by it! 3) At the conclusion of the original text as of 1950, Gombrich reflects on how modern art fares after the artist cannot set to work directed by some purpose, imposed upon him by his patron or by tradition. This classic may be depended upon for training one’s eye to see what is there in a work of art: for the author excels at dispensing a handful of simple pointers to characteristics of style while not descending into an exhaustive discussion of rules or technicalities. A great deal of Gombrich’s expertise goes into a discriminating selection of what paintings to show and discretion as to what to say about them and what to leave out – precisely what AI knows nothing about! Nowadays, everyone reflexively turns to the internet whenever a question arises. While this manner of proceeding does yield instant gratification, it tends, once one becomes habituated to it, to a piecemeal and fragmented acquisition of knowledge that winds up being very deficient compared to the systematic induction into a field one would derive from studying a well-written textbook. Therefore, tilt against the trend of the times and pore over an old master like Gombrich!"

This new brilliant and luxury edition makes it the perfect way to illustrate a great classic."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"""There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists- men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful gift of balancing shapes and colours till they are 'right', and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work... But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.' (453-4) Sometimes I just need to read a textbook. History is underrated and I really needed to learn what is the big deal with Michelangelo. Or why art became abstract and I love it, but what makes it legit? I had picked up impressions here and there in my own foraging, but it is extremely satisfying to be able to put it together into a cohesive conversation and storyline. Albeit, that means this was a dense book to get through with so many artists and artworks but the author did a good job of not just making this a back catalogue of art. And pair this with my knack of barreling through books no matter how painful, I am happy to say I have finally finished this book!!!!! ;-) Gombrich's main thesis is that there is no ""Art"" but artists, which lends this book to a very thorough and robust history of not only artworks but philosophies and the human beings behind them. This is not just a book of information but a well-thought out story of Western art, both its technical aspects which is, of course, a very important foundation to the story, as well as the confluent history and philosophy behind it from prehistoric ages up to the 1950s (modern era). I think observing the changing trends of art and architecture is a great way to learn about world history and philosophical thought. The tone of the book did not give me a sense of propaganda, another positive from learning from a book and not the Internet; neither the conservatism that sees anything after the masters of the Renaissance as a deterioration or a progressivism that views ancient art as elitist or out-of-touch. I was most excited to get to the chapter, ""Break from Tradition"" with the Impressionists and the rest, because that's so close to my timeline! It was interesting to see how art moved from a ritual-related community medium, to a patron-mediated form for showing off mostly, to artists gaining notoriety and more freedom in the Renaissance, to the break from tradition and moving into a more subjective aim coming from the exhaustion of previously set rules that has to do with expressing pure emotion akin to what music does. How it moved from a concern for symbols and lessons (Medieval age) to realistic representation (Renaissance) to work that contains a sense of childlike wonder and spontaneity (which I would characterize the mind and emotion dichotomy). The impact of the Reformation on the art that developed in Italy v.s. Northern Europe and England. The move from idealized beauty in the Renaissance to the need to depict things exactly as they are in nature during Realism to spotlighting the disinherited and ugly in the modern era. In a technical sense, the summary of struggles can be described as the attempt to find balance between form and expressive pattern/color, and the desire to find a 'soul' in the art when it gets too bogged down by technique, rules, and gimmicks. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful postscript that was a sort of meta-commentary on his previous work and as it relates to even more contemporary times (at time of writing, 1965)- how we are prone to think of history, much less art history, to be a linear progression of 'better' works and if the public marginalized unconventional artists, today we are all too eager to praise anything that has a hint of change or novelty. A delicious digestivi to top off the 27-course meal. ""The artist or critic has no such clear-cut tests [as scientists do]. And yet he feels that it is no longer possible to ask for time to consider whether a new experiment makes sense or not."" (465) What struck me the most is how the story of art is really a constant conversation between artists and society, and how much of the artistic tradition was formed due to economic constraints from the relationship between artists and the public. For most of these artists, it was them working out their most personal and existential quandaries through the medium of art. This makes me ask my principal question from reading this book, which is, ""What kind of art would these artists have made if they were able to resolve their existential qualms and longings in their real lives, and let art be not an attempt to prove themselves, but a medium with which they can engage with peace? Some of the 'primitive' art that these modern European artists sought out had the 'expressiveness, clarity of structure, and simplicity of technique' (428). Did they tie themselves in knots over nothing?"" A.k.a. ""Did the West overthink?"" which is a valid question to ask most of the time since the Enlightenment maybe. Though, I wonder if that would make for boring history of art. I think the one artist who represents this as an example though is Rembrandt, who does not make his subject matter beautiful in an idealized way, but does not discard mastery of painting principles. My favorite artist was probably Picasso and my favorite artwork his little ceramic plate of the bird. Favorite painting was Whistler's Noctourne in Blue and Silver: Old Battersea Bridge. Raphael is a close second with his depiction of movement and balance of figures. I also appreciated the liveliness of Frans Hals' portrait of Pieter van der Broecke, Birds in a bush (from Egyptian tomb from the Middle Kingdom), Maiden gathering flowers (Wall-painting from 1st AD in Naples), Botticelli's Venus. Favorite moment was probably seeing how the West took from the East, especially Japanese woodblock and such and the reason why - they disregarded the rules of composition so long upheld by the academies. Or how Art Noveau was successful because it was based on the new possibilities for new material of iron and glass developing an ornamental style of its own (406). Or how modern artists are fascinated now by texture and are interested in multimedia works, between painting and sculpture. Or how new aims lead to new technologies, so Impressionism led to paints applied directly on the surface to obtain the reflections of light rather than premeditating a primary layer of paint. I also liked reading about the Egyptians and how they would represent each part of the body from the angle that showed its best feature which leads to its unique design. The juxtaposition of Northern Europe's focus on materials/details and Italy's focus on human forms. Cézanne and how he integrated the Impressionists' work with the past by finding a balance between 'strong, intense colours' and 'lucid patterns'... spontaneity but also clarity and order. I understood Baroque architecture more, how it is irregularity brought together by its decorative elements to make a cohesive, unified whole (v.s. Renaissance architecture which is inspired by the Classical era, much more elegant and simple, and composed or repeating, atomic, self-sufficient parts). I want to read more about art in the East and the impact of Eastern philosophy, as art and society found a strong draw toward it in the desire for spontaneity. In strange tangents, this book made me hopeful because there were a couple examples of artists who are known in the canon who was able to create because they had an independent source of income and used their leisure time to create art. I love suffering artists but I'm all for breaking the myth."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I received this book from a very good friend of mine after having a conversation in which I showed little admiration for art critics, and for the power forces that determine what is relevant and what is not relevant in the arts. This personal opinion probably arises from the fact that I do art that has no commercial value. While my friend didn’t intend to show me why I was right or wrong in my opinion, he thought it would be interesting for me to read what someone who had spent his life studying had to say about that particular subject. The book is an amazing journey through major events in Western Art (he basically ignores Oriental achievements such as Chinese calligraphy or Tibetan sand mandalas). It shows, with a fair amount of excellently chosen examples, how artists have faced and solved problems (problems of shape, space, color, ideas, constructions) throughout history, and the answers or conclusions they have arrived to. The author does an excellent job in trying to make all these examples work together, showing how one painting can be see as an improvement (or better, a succession) to another painting previously exposed in the book. This makes all the paintings displayed on this book have a connection with each other, giving the reader a better understanding of the whole. As many people, I have always wondered why some artists have been more relevant than others. I think few people cannot be shocked to see that a Rothko or a late work by Picasso can be sold for much more money than a painting by Ilya Repin, or by John Singer Seargent. This book makes great attempt to explain, almost objectively, the importance of paintings such as the Mona Lisa (introducing the revolutionary technique of sfumato), or of artists such as Willem Kalf (changing people and landscapes for vases and bread as his main subject study). It was very pleasing to understand why artists like Giotto, Van Eyck, Rubens, or Raphael have the status they have. I think that Gombrich has produced an excellent work that might serve as an introduction, or guide, to any particular style, epoch, or artist in which the reader is interested."
The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This is not a breezy book. Art, as I had always encountered it, was always rather stuffy and rather incomprehensible, and that was kind of okay? Like, I didn't mind not getting it because Art and I Were Just Not That Close. The funny thing is that this book seriously puts you *there* with art, it tells you all the context you need to know to not feel like art is something people bullshit you about with long-winded commentaries or that you look at a museum and say 'Yeeeep yep yep yep. A.. picture. Indeed.' This books makes everything a lot easier to grasp, makes the developments in art make sense and helps you see why it all has value, how it all strives to solve problems or, in it's own way, to be useful. I really like the way it makes the assertion that art is 'contemplative' so incomplete. Sure, art is contemplative, but it definitely had a use, was *meant* for something, and later on, was a medium through which artists explored problems of technique, not just like, splattered paint on a canvas or crazy lines for no reason. In the end I can't say I can appreciate art more, because I definitely still have a lot of problems looking at art by myself ('yeeep yep yep yep... art indeed') BUT the book helped me understand art history a lot better, and how it was shaped by its time and how and why it changes. That definitely goes a long way. The narrative is quite engaging and clear. I agree with other comments here that it definitely suffers a bit from the time it was written (it's rather condescending to 'primitives' and rather racist, and this is not about World Art so much as Europe-US art) but for one that's just starting to dabble in art history, this is definitely a clarifying and eye opening read."

The Story of Art is a chronicle of art history from its origins in ancient cave paintings to the Post-Modernism of the later twentieth century. While a product of his time (Gombrich spends the vast majority of the book on male European artists) Gombrich can at times be surprisingly progressive in his recognition of the value of non-European and folk art, and his love of and dedication to the subject of art history shines through every page. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves art and has a lot of time on their hands."

""Art"" in the modern sense, esp after the impressionists is a relatively recent phenomenon, in which an artist has transitioned from being a craftsman (like a cobbler or a mason, indeed a person barely respected by the nobility) to a liberated creative (like a poet) through the intervening age of the Renaissance. The book is massive in its coverage and covers art right from the Greeks till the 1950s in about 500 pages and yet manages to deliver insight beyond barely naming the artists and techniques (in fact he shuns all jargon and that's a huge advantage for non-experts) although admittedly he is partial to the medieval and Renaissance era and is mainly confined to European art."

The very title itself, then, testifies to the Euro-American-centric/colonialist attitudes of the times in which this was produced—but the faults of the book remain apparent even after overlooking this. Severely marred by Gombrich's several unfounded prejudices (case in point: that ""Constable's path... achieved something of more lasting importance"" than Turner's) that find absolutely no correspondence in reality; even more aggravating is his attempt to offer these partial judgments as fact/objective observation—which I find to be academically and intellectually dishonest."

The Story of Art,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222078.The_Story_of_Art/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"The book tells the history of art with a mellifluous language in a story-like fashion. Reading it had a significant effect on my views on concepts like ""renaissance"", ""baroque"", ""french revolution"" etc. Probably the most shocking one has been that the author relates the birth of renaissance to the artist's struggle to make the public accept his profession as one beyond a handcraft. At school, we were taught that there were much more ""elevated"" reasons behind such big changes in the progress of the mankind."

They make me feel better in the moment, but ultimately don't do much towards building a full picture of happiness. The inherent problem in any book that's a how-to for something artistic, whether it be writing or painting or making music or the artistry in tailoring a custom Voltron costume, the problem with the how-to book is that when you're reading the how-to book you're not doing the actual thing you're being taught to do. In other words, a book ABOUT writing is probably less helpful to a writer than a book that's just plain good. A how-to book about painting is probably of less use than a book of paintings you enjoy. I'm not saying there's no place for these types of books, and this one is smart because it's a quick read and it sticks pretty well to the motivational side of things as opposed to the nuts and bolts. It's good to read motivational stuff, especially because creating art can be a pretty lonely process. It's just hard to pack away the awareness that while you're reading about creating art, you could spend that time creating art."

It's a quick read that you can finish in one sitting, but the ideas and advice it contains will stay with you long after you've put it down. Some of Austin's suggestions will validate what you're already doing, some will challenge you to fundamentally change a creative practice, others will inspire you to grab a notebook and get to work immediately. Because it's such a small and accessible book, you'll want to go back to it from time to time. Just like Stephen King's , as you change and grow as an artist, it reveals new ideas and inspirations to you that you may have missed on a previous read. This is a fantastic addition to your library, and a wonderful gift for any creative person in your life."

Here are the Top Ten Points that the author makes in this teeny book: 1. Steal like an artist 2. Don't wait until you know who you are to get started 3. Write the book you want to read 4. Use your hands 5. Side projects and hobbies are important 6. Do good work and share it with people 7. Geography is no longer our master 8. Be nice (the world is a small town) 9. Be boring (it's the only way to get work done) 10. Creativity is subtraction It's all very good advice. It's all great reminders. But that's what these are - reminders. The beef I have with self-help or how-to books is that the information inside the covers is stuff you already know. You just haven't thought about it before. This isn't to say that these books aren't helpful for many - but for people who are too busy (or, in extreme cases, too lazy) to think for themselves. They can read the books and their third eye can open and they can think they've just broke new ground... and then they don't go off to do what it is they were learning how-to do. What is good about Kleon's book is that he acknowledges almost immediately that there is no such thing as originality. Had he not written that very early on I'd be calling him a hypocrite right now for trying to pass any of this off as original. But that wasn't his intention - he saw a market for his advice and he went with it, so I give him props for that. It's just that I'm such a cynical person anyway, I'm wary of these sorts of ""guides"". I'd much rather a person just muddle through on their own based on their own experiences, learning from all the good and the bad that happens, and creating something out of all of that. This is a Hot Topic sort of creativity - mass marketed, polished, packaged. So why did I read it? Great question, because this is not at all my thing. I was curious, primarily. I came across his name because I came across someone's blog where the author was writing about her journal, which led to her discussion of Kleon's log books, and I was curious to see what he could possibly say about creativity. That's One. Two: I'm fascinated by the creative process. What works for me and my creativity is going to be completely different from my boyfriend's creative process, or my best friend's creative process, or the stranger down the street. I like reading about the daily process that my favorite writers/musicians/artists/people to get into their creative groove because it's fascinating, not because I want to copy them (though Kleon recommends a lot of copying; and this isn't to say there's anything wrong with it, per se, but it's not my motivation). The information here isn't necessary for the stuff people generally consider ""creative"" - some of stuff is helpful just in your daily life. People think a 9-to-5 job is energy-sapping and you can't be creative in your boring white-collar job, and those people sit back and do... well, very little of anything... and judge the rest of us who have to work for what we want and say we're not creative. I am creative in my job as much as possible and on paper it's not a very creative position. I have to be creative to find ways of being creative. And when it works, it works well, and it comes up in my annual reviews regularly, so I'm occasionally doing something right. This book is a good reminder for people in those positions too, who think they aren't in any position to be creative. Don't get all stuck on what you or are not doing, don't compare yourself to other people. (That's not even a part of Kleon's advice. That one comes from me. And a bunch of other people.) The part I like the best is #5. Hobbies important. I always have a side project of some sort, but I have yet to figure out how to consistently have energy after my stupid 9-to-5 job (actually it's a 7-something-to-4-something job, but that's beside the point). I was hoping for some insight from Kleon on that, but it wasn't really there. He basically just said ""Hey, you can do this!"" which, yeah, okay, thanks, I tell myself that every day, but I'm still tired and sapped. Probably from all that creativity I do at work - coming up with ways not to kill people or worry about backstabbing takes a crapload of energy and creativity. So, again, great reminders here, and really great for Millennials and Gen Y and whatever generation comes after those kids (have they been named yet??). It's a fast read, hopefully inspiring, even if for just the moment. But don't get bogged down by it. Read it because it's fast and easy, feel good for a few, and then go on and do your thing. Do . That's all you can answer to regularly anyway. The other thing I fully 100-bajillion% agree with Kleon about - keep a journal. Do whatever you want in those pages, but keep thing. If you want to be creative in any way, that's going to be your rock. I fill mine with everything. EVERYTHING. You could flip through them, but you'd think I am a serial killer. I mean it's all very insane in these journals. (And I would have to kill you after you flipped through them, so.) But that's what works for me. Figure out what works for you and do that. You'll appreciate it later. A little heavy-handed with all the quotes, but again, feels more geared towards younger readers anyway, and hopefully many readers will want to know more about those quoted people which is certainly Kleon's point. And on that note (I can quote too!), I'll share one of my favorites from David Foster Wallace's :"

Given that I'm not an artist - I wasn't seeking 'words- of -wisdom'. This book just landed in my hands - and I couldn't resist reading it. Austin says ""every artist gets asked the question, ""where do you get your ideas?"" Austin says....'The honest artist answers', ""I steal them""...... ............as in RIPS THEM OFF? Perhaps a more 'kind' way to answer the question --- is an artist draws inspiration from others. But what do I know. I'm not an artist. This little book is filled with fun engaging anecdotes.....with a list of 10 things to do to unlock our creativity. #9 is BE BORING!!! I've got that one down!!! I'm a master of boring!!!......but creative? I have my doubts! He recommended 10 books we should read: I've only read 1 on his list. ""Bird by Bird"". By Anne Lamott. -- Proof: I AM NOT CREATIVE?/! But..... Austin listed THINGS WE MUST DO: Take a walk --- works for me!!! Start your swipe file --- What the hell is a swipe file? Go to the library --- I DO! Buy a notebook and use it ----Done! Get yourself a Calendar ----Done! Start your logbook---For what? Give a copy of this book away-----More sales for Austin Kleon - ok - I'm willing! Start a blog --- You've got to be kidding: Goodreads takes enough time. Take a nap!!!!!!! ---- Favorite advice in the book!!! This is a great book to read 'while' being lazy - boring - sleepy - in your pj's -when you need something 'little & lightweight' to hold in your hands!"

Yeah, probably because they thought you already knew them. This book is packed to the brim with platitudes such as: try to do good work, there are lots of different things to consider when choosing a place to live, it's important to be careful who you marry, money is really important, try to find a day job that you like and, my favorite, take $10 to the stationers and buy some stuff - then you can write your ideas down. Genius. The contradictions here are irritating also. He says that computers are soul suckers and time wasters and then says that it's great to create blogs and that it's important to have an online community of friends, he says ignore your critics and then recommends keeping a praise file to use at times of insecurity. It's all a little weird. It's not that I disagree with the guy, although he has a few ideas that seem strange to me, it's just that everything here is so bland that I wonder what the purpose of this book is, except that it might have something to do with 'money being really important' to the author. Maybe the main title of the book should read 'Steal Like An Artist...from gullible readers'."

The audience was a mix of young artists trying to make their way, fans of the artist, and amateur art enthusiasts just there for the experience. While offering words of wisdom to the young artists in the crowd, he said: “every day you have to wake up in the morning and tell yourself a story, even if it’s bullshit.” He was referring to the dark voice that talks to artists who haven’t made it big yet. Writers and musicians have that dark voice also. It’s that dark voice that whispers into your ear at night and tells you that your work isn’t good enough. That dark voice that tells you someone has already made something like this before. That dark voice that tells you, you’re a fraud. That dark voice that tells you that you can’t be like your favorite author. That dark voice that tells you that you’d rather be watching Netflix than writing. That dark voice that whispers “no one wants to read this shit”. This book is for writers, artists, and musicians. This book is the “bullshit” you have to tell yourself. This book is the middle finger to that dark voice that creeps into your subconscious."

Austin Kleon writes in an easy-to-follow style, instructing readers about how to be creative without talking down to anyone. In fact while I read the book, I felt like I was part of some secret creators club, with this book as the secret club manual. The book focuses on 10 rules for people to follow in order to be creative. Rule number one is ""Steal like an artist."" The other nine are printed on the back of the book, but simply knowing the rules does not give you an edge in creativity. You need the explanations, the stories, the logic behind the rules that Mr. Kleon provides to get that tingly feeling (figuratively speaking, of course). I recommend this book for anyone over the age of 10, anyone who loves to create but feels stifled in today's world, anyone who loves to think, and anyone doing anything at all creative."

While I appreciate the premise — draw inspiration from people you admire and surround yourself with good role models — I'm uneasy with the ""steal"" concept. The title grabs attention, but I think it overshadows the actual point, which is not to become a replica of someone else but to create more authentic work by creating work you love. It's a bit overly simplistic, and definitely a short, fast read. For those who stand on the precipice, afraid to answer the call of creative spirit, it will serve as a ""soft entry"" to better books, like Anne Lammott's ""Bird by Bird,"" Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" and Julia Cameron's ""The Sound of Paper."" For tired, disillusioned creatives, it may also reinvigorate. Those in the thick of creating will probably want something meatier. Reading Kleon's book, I can see some of his influences, particularly a heavy nod toward bloggers-cum-authors like Seth Godin and Hugh MacLeod. I also drink the Kool-Aid offered by Godin, MacLeod, Johnny B. Truant, Brian Clark of Copyblogger, Chris Guillebeau of The Art of Non-Conformity, and others. I like them all and find inspiration often in their words. But if you're young and impressionable, if you are on the edge of your art and not fully-formed, it's easy to miss the deeper points they make. It's easy to miss the parts where they say it's hard and often sucks and sometimes seems pointless and sometimes is a colossal failure. Their passion for what they do is so charismatic that it's easy to get swept away, missing the part where they learned — through trial, error, mentors or schooling — how to market themselves effectively, how to manage money, how to lose the ""romance"" of being an artist and still find pleasure when the passion grows cool. It's not enough to love what you do. Perhaps that sounds harsh, perhaps it's a cynical, jaded worldview. It's tempered by experience. Loving your craft is fine if you want it to be a hobby. But if you want to keep a roof over your head with the work you produce, if you want to make a living at it until the end of your days, love will not keep you alive. I worry for the writers, journalists and photographers who load up on humanities courses in college, the ones who believe suffering for your craft is noble — or eventually successful. Please, please, creative types ... take a few business classes. Maintain a broad skill set. Don't tangle your identity up in your art or your profession, because if anything takes those away, you will be left rootless, drifting, and the road to recovery will be very, very hard. I know I sound jaded and bitter. I'm not at all. I'm still passionate about what I do. But that passion is tempered by the pesky ""reality thing"" I always preferred to ignore. I never wanted to be bothered by the ""boring"" things like money, accounting, contracts, marketing. But these are the things that provide the income to keep DOING your art. If you're going to steal like an artist, steal the business sense they bring to the table as well. I promise, you will never regret the time you spend learning the mechanics behind the career. With any luck, it will enable you until the end of your days to create wonderful things only you can bring to the world. Starving artists living in garrets can produce great work. But smart artists will find the road so much easier and equally as fulfilling."

I also like the fact that his book titles sound like a click bait but after reading them you will realize that they are accurate. The book does not encourage stealing or plagiarism and I found out that I have been stealing like an artist for a long period of time, the point is that most things have been done or said so you take a bit from everywhere, add your own touch and voila, you are a new artist now! The book had many great quotes from many different people! I have been applying this in medicine, in school, in reviews and in almost everything I do. The book is easy to read, uses drawings and bullet points which makes it fun!

Many things are just rehashed stuff from elsewhere. And steal? Like an artist? Yeah, there are lots of controvercies and the plagiaristic hearings are among the most unclear and pointless ones, I say. Still, ouch. And steal?? Some of us steal inspiration from sun, rehash Picasso, get the energy to do wonderful staff brom bipolar disorder and technique from schisophrenia, and yeah, it's totally all right to do any of that. Some don't. Many don't. Still, it's all right to flip through someone else's work to try and get new things done, things that haven't yet been done. Just don't steal literally, it's not nice.

The post was basically one man’s manifesto when it came to creativity. He listed out ten things he wished he knew when he was starting out as a writer and artist. I remember the simplicity of his statements — practical, to the point — but also incredibly insightful. Small things we often forget when we are knee-deep in The Creating or overwhelmed by The Doubts. I remember nodding my head in agreement to nearly everything in that blog post, and then just the other day, while I was at B&N, I saw his book on the shelf. That blog post (by Austin Kleon) has been turned into a lovely little book: Steal Like an Artist. I bought it, took it home, read it in under an hour, and experienced the euphoria I had reading the original blog post all over again. I wanted to jump up and shout, “Yes! This! Exactly this!” This book is a little piece of genius and I think that Every. Single. Person. leading a creative life ought to read it. Or at least flip through a couple pages. Why? Let me give you a sampling. The book opens with a quote from Pablo Picasso –”Art is theft.” — and then goes on to discuss how nothing is truly original. How every idea is simply a re-imagining of previous works. Kleon says: Oh my goodness, yes! Nothing is new. Everything is borrowed and expanded upon. From here, the idea of “stealing” is introduced. And not stealing as in plagiarizing. That is bad. BAD! Plagiarizing is trying to pass someone else’s work off as your own. Kleon instead talks about “copying” as a method of practice, as a way of finding yourself. He talks about surrounding yourself with the work of the artists you love, and the work of the artists those artists love, and studying everything. Embrace those artists. Emulate them. Try to create not only as they create, but to see as they see. Get inside their minds. The goal of copying is to see the ways in which you can’t be those artists because they are them and you are you. Kleon says this much better than me: And then Kleon gives the most basic advice: Start making stuff. Just start! He talks about how “imposter syndrome” often holds people back. (I know for a fact that I struggle with this daily.) So what is “imposter syndrome?” YES! It’s like he’s in my head. I do feel like a phony, a hack, a sad excuse for a writer. I don’t know what I’m doing, and that’s OK. No one does. Every writer face doubts and fears. They sit down and create without knowing the answers — from the NYT Bestselling author, to the child picking up a pencil to draft their very first story. The rest of the book became a sort of surreal reading experience for me, where I felt like Kleon was sitting in my office, speaking directly to me. Everything I need to hear when I’m lost in revisions or slogging through a first draft or swimming in the Vortex of Self-Doubt and Loathing for any number of reasons was in this book. Sometimes these words of encouragement were written: And then there were the doodles — you can see a bunch more — interspersed between all the brilliance: While I’ve summarized the book in this post, it’s nothing like the actual experience of reading it. Between the simple statements, sketched visuals, and conversational tone, it’s almost as if Kleon is speaking directly to you. This book is honest. And beautiful. And real. And it’s just good advice. For a creative life, but for life in general. But of course, as Kleon points out on the very last page: Isn’t that the truth? Originally reviewed ."

Really?! What were you expecting? Do you want the author to write you your new novel, grant application, play? Should he wipe your ass too, while he is at it? Get to it. Stop complaining. This isn’t a technical manual or a blueprint for idea. This book does, in my opinion, exactly what it claims to do – no more, no less. Inspirational, a good reminder that the walls we put up around ourselves in the creative domain can be torn down and erected at will. A couple of my favourite quotes:"

This is a wonderful little book with advice on creativity that makes you think. I'm pretty sure i didn't grasp the whole thing right now. I think i'll take a few things out of it. And in a few months I might read it again (really only takes like 30 minutes) and take a few more things out of it. It's nicely written, it's got some nice napkin-sketches in there so it stays a light read. And it also makes me very curious about the authors poetry book . So aye, he's smart! Ouch. This one kind of hit home. Although i do always plan to read the books i buy (almost) straight away, it just never ends up that way. But it's true though, my library reminds me that the world is full of undiscovered territories and opportunities. I like that! Having bookshelves with only 'read' books would be quite boring, no? I find this actually true. To be effective and productive i often immediately start working on my pc (whatever it is: ideas, presentations...) and at one point i'm typically stuck. I take a piece of paper and i start writing random ideas on there. Drawings things, with lots of arrows. And somehow the ones that went through the random paper process always end up being better, much better. I figure i'll immediately start on paper as of now. See? this one is the best advice of all. And so true. I actually didn't need this book to tell me this, I already know. I never get good ideas when on a deadline or when I'm busy-busy-busy. The best work I do is when i think i'm just fiddling around. And yet somehow my bosses insist on piling work on top of work on top of work. Maybe i should tell to read this book!"

At a slim 100-something pages, it is a fast engaging read, filled with doodles and quotes and functioning the way zines your internet friend would send you. I say this because it is the equivalent of a whole body approach to creativity as opposed to the spot treatment of fixing one specific area of your art, whatever your medium may be; to put it simply, it's seeing the forest for the trees. Kleon encourages living a creative life in which you make and play while allowing yourself opportunity to work and grow at your own pace. Creativity is less about what you make than the process it took to get you there. You might not even end up making what you intended when you began but you will make something and you will find yourself in the process. Highly recommended for the overly stimulated, easily hopeless creative minds."

You'll either find the answer or you'll come up with a better question."" And on the next page: ""Collect books, even if you don't plan on reading them right away. Nothing is more important than an unread library."" Maybe it's just me, but this rubbed me the wrong way. Google is not the answer to everything.

I really like his style of writing and his motivated thoughts and the drawings as well. Reading this book brought me the same feeling as enjoying a delicious piece of chocolate cake; it is brief, simple, deep and amusing! But what I like the most about this book is its writer's creativity and his boundless imagination, this is the kind of books that breaks the stereotypes and replace them by originative ideas. I took some useful notes instead of rereading the book: 💡You are not bound to create something original because the word original literally doesn't exist ,so free yourself from the burden of being original and embrace influence instead of running from it. 💡Just as you have a familial genealogy , you also have a genealogy of ideas. 💡The books we read and people we are surrounded with and friends we pick determine our vision and the quality of our ideas because we are a mashup of what we opt in our life. 💡Be aware of the ideas you collect and the people you deal with because we will be influenced by them indirectly. 💡Be curious about anything and everything and get your own education don't wait for school to teach you. 💡 Be a genuine nerd, google everything; you may find the answer to your question or you will get a better question. 💡Jot any thought comes to your mind, and copy useful quotes from the books you read and even record overheard conversation! then collect them in a ""swipe file"". 💡Making things paves the way to explore yourself and your capacities but the reverse is incorrect. 💡 Glenn o'Brien said: ""start out as a phony and became real"" thats means pretend you are a successful person until you can achieve it , or fake that you are doing something you want until you can really make it. 💡Observe successful people and start to mimic their style of thinking and doing things, don't just emulate theirs looks from outside but their way of looking at the world. 💡In any field you are intrested in do your work the way you want to see it done . 💡Find a way to bring your body into your work; use your hands intead of just staying in front of your computer; share your hands in the work of your brain. 💡Be an expert of the productive procrastination by doing more than one project at once , move from one to another when you fell broed until you finish them all. 💡Having a hobby is really helpful for your career and your spirit. 💡Share a little glimpse of your process with people. 💡Get rid of social media for a while, isolate yourself from people, pick up a book and enjoy your own company . 💡Be nice to everybody and ignore your enemies to vanquish them. 💡Surround yourself with positive people , and pay attention to the ideas and the quality of thoughts you are influenced by in the social media. 💡Make friendships and be helpful to talented people . 💡Whatever your work is, keeping a file of praise that you heard or read from people who appreciate your work is a wonderful boost when you need the lift. 💡Save your energy and your money as much as you can . 💡You really need a calender to organize your work and a logbook to tackle your progress. 💡Creativity should be restricted or related by limitations or less potentials to be revealed. In the end he adds some suggestions of useful books as Egnore Everybody by Hugh Macleod, Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud and Make a World by Ed Emberley. The book is pretty easy to read and very enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone :)."

It is full of what I consider basic, sensible advice for creatives and people looking to practice creativity in their daily lives. Although I would consider the ideas presented merely suggestions because you know what, just do what works for you. There is absolutely no perfect template for creation. Kleon touches on several things like ""imposter syndrome"" that affects a lot of artists, no matter their level. Hehe, hard not to relate! I see it with a lot of my friends too, just the other day one of my favorite, incredibly successful friends was talking about this! We're all just figuring it out as we go along. Imo one of the potential good things about this feeling is it forces you to challenge yourself, to keep trying to evolve beyond where you are and what you are currently creating. Some of the key things he mentions which I try and practice: do anything you can to carve 0ut time to do your creative work. Build a schedule. Maintaining a discipline is important. Do not be afraid to be influenced by artists you admire. Look at and study their work. Even if you start off by imitating, you practice long enough you will generally end up making it your own. That said, always have to be careful not to just blindly copy or follow rote patterns. Although I do think copying is a great practice tool allowing you to reverse-engineer and learn other peoples' problem-solving methods. I do quite a bit of digital work but I also agree with his view on computers. Having a glass screen in front of you is stultifying in certain ways. I always work with physical materials to start projects, the possibilities seem more limitless with those materials. Once the work has gotten to the point of being on the computer the endpoint is more-defined, the work is more tracked, and an element of perfectionism can creep in (partly because it is so easy to constantly erase). This is merely how it works and feels for me, I'm sure it might be different for others. The other book in this vein that I'm planning on reading is Twyla Tharpe's The Creative Habit. Heard it was good, from what I understand one of its main points of emphasis is the discipline required to consistently create."

Definitely worth keeping on your bedside table or work desk if you're an artist of any kind (writer, musician, dancer, etc). Probably the piece that stuck out the most for me was Kleon's discussion of constraints. I've known that putting constraints on, say, a piece of writing - putting a box around what I was trying to create - actually made the piece better and, strangely enough, made me feel more free. It was refreshing to hear this bit of advice from someone else. And that's really why this book is great. Kleon takes the things artists know but rarely articulate and he articulates them. Really a book to keep on hand whenever you're feeling stuck."

In other words we are all creative, aren't we? According to Austin Kleon, when people give you advice, they're actually talking to themselves in the past. So this book is him talking to a previous version of himself. You can finish this book in less than two hours, but don't do that. Take your own time, if you have read something which you found interesting, ponder over it, one thing may lead to another. For example the writer says that we don't get to pick our family, but we can pick our teachers and we can pick our friends and we can pick the music we listen to and we can pick the movies we see. I wrote this in my note book and tried to analyze it. I felt that we can't get to choose our family or our relatives. It means that we are what we are because of our friends we choose and the most important the books we read. I sometimes think where I would be if it were not for the books I read. That's one habit which has helped me the most. Now I'd like to share some of my favorite quotes from the book: 1.We are shaped and fashioned by what we love. 2.The artists is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference. Hoarder collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. 3.School is one thing. Education is another. The two don't always overlap. Whether you're in school or not, it's always your job to get yourself an education. 4.Fake it till you make it. In Hindi we say, ""nakal karte karte akal aajatee hey."" 5.The best advice is not to write what you know, it's to write what you like. 6.Work that only comes from the head isn't good. Watch a great musician play a show. Watch a great leader give a speech. You'll see what I mean. 7.Creative people need time to just sit around and do nothing. I get some of my best ideas when I'm bored, which is why I never take my shirts to the cleaners. I love ironing my shirts - it's so boring, I always get good ideas. If you're out of ideas, wash the dishes. Take a really long walk. Stare at a spot on the wall as long as you can. As the artists Maira Kalman says,""Avoiding work is the way to focus my mind. 8. You don't put yourself online only because you have something to say - you can put yourself online to find something to say. The Internet can be more than just resting place to publish your finished ideas - it can also be an incubator for ideas that aren't fully formed, a birthing center for developing work that you haven't started yet. 9.If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room. 10.It takes a lot of energy to be creative. You don't have the energy if you waste it on other stuff. 11. In the end, creativity isn't the just the things we choose to put in, it's the things we choose to leave out. Choose wisely. And have fun."

Kahn and Vint Cerf create the Internet?” on Quora where he wrote that it was a cumulative effort of generations : ""Of course, our work benefited from the predecessor network: the ARPANET, and the work of many others who invented the transistor, the computer, time-sharing, packet switching, multiple programming languages, and a long list of other things. Things on the scale of the Internet are the product of vast numbers of contributors."" Steal Like an artist echoes this idea. Any great creative work is influenced by some source or the other. The book tells you to go ahead and start making the art instead of waiting for the eureka moment. ""Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started. If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. You’re ready. Start making stuff."" I believe this principle is not limited to artists. After all any work if done passionately, becomes a piece of art to its creator, irrespective of whether it has been done on a drawing board or a breadboard."

Author Austin Kleon points out that no artist's work is ever completely original, and that trying to be completely original will daunt an artist and eventually smother her/his creativity. He suggests artists embrace the inevitability of influence, celebrate living outside of a vacuum, relax, and have fun with their art. Beyond that, he offers tips on how to stay focused, upbeat, and receptive to incoming inspiration. True to its subject, this book features an abundance of quotes and tips from artists who aren't the author. I like that. Instead of this book feeling like one guy talking about what works for him, it seems more like a panel of successful artists sharing their processes (which also happen to work for the one guy). Advice I like in particular: - Every night, before going to sleep, think about one thing that made you happy that day. - Jerry Seinfeld's calendar idea: keep a year-at-a-glance calendar, and every day that you do everything you were supposed to, mark an X on the calendar. See how long you can get a row of Xs."

This book was okay... This book was an extremely short read. I read it in around forty-five minutes. It is filled with advice, quotes, illustrations, and newspaper blackout poems. This book had some great advice. I wrote down some of these tips because I think they'd be helpful to practice, but this book has some extreme pacing issues. You'd be reading some great writing advice, and then, two pages of random quotes and newspaper blackout poems shoved right in between a paragraph. I was confused on whether I was to skip the random inserts, finish reading the advice, and then come back to read the inserts, or if I was to read the inserts and then continue onto the advice. But either way, this really broke the immersion for me. The thing with self-help is that it makes you feel productive and inspired reading these books, but then if you don't take and use such advice, it's rather pointless. A lot of these books claim that if you buy said book, you'll do with your life, and , and as well. It's easy to get caught in a loop of buying and consuming these books, whilst it has no effect on your actual life. That's why, oftentimes, I don't rate these books as highly as other people. There are some genuinely good advice and practices in this book. It is annoying to deal with all the inserted material, but overall it was decently enjoyable. Definitely re-readable. This one was okay, but I couldn't recommend his other short self-help books. They were so tedious and repetitive to get through, that I just couldn't bring me to finish them, despite their short lengths."

I'm feeling now I really didn't need to buy a book with the phrase ""10 things nobody told you about being creative"" on the cover, because I've already told myself nearly all of it. The other parts I didn't really consider were either contradictory of themselves or would in no way relate to how I do things inside my creative process. ""Get really bored"" for example. For real? As a creative type I can't *stand* to get bored. I'm not going to take time from my day to sit down and TRY to become bored in order to get some inspiration; I'm going to go out and look at things. Engage! Kick start my brain; not put it in neutral. And his section of advice called ""Marry Well""? Puh. If we're to a comfortable enough point in life to consider marriage, the partner already knows what it's like to be with a creative person. We (artists) aren't going to go out ""shopping"" for a significant other and stress Kleon's bullets of what they'd be getting themselves into before working out a deal. Congrats to you, Austin Kleon, for finding a wife that will feed you, clean up after you and motivate you. Some of us are busy doing all of that for others while we're still trying to be artists. I also very much dislike how much ""steal"" is stressed in this book, & made to sound normal and perfectly acceptable. I worked in a graphics department once and nearly every designer there stole the foundation for their work from Pinterest. IT DROVE ME UP THE WALL. Use your own mind! There is a difference between being original and mimicking someone else's work. I'm not sure how you can be proud of something-- or even call it your creation-- when it originated from someone else's efforts. Sigh. Please don't pay full price for this book, or even buy it new. Borrow a copy from somewhere and give it straight back."

With a title like that, I wanted to read a book about stealing ideas to boost your creativity as an artist. The book was a little bit about that, but mostly it was about being organized, managing your money well, and living a happy life. Nothing wrong with that. I liked this book, but there was very little ground-breaking or unusual here. Yes, he's encouraging us to put together various ideas (stolen from others) and package it as your own new and unique thing, and yes, this book is an example of that. But I don't think that the way he put everything together amounted to anything terribly special. Meanwhile, the marketing is pretty good because: I don't often buy random books, but for some reason I spied this at the bookstore and decided to buy it. So I've got to give the author (or maybe his publisher?) credit for that! But I wouldn't recommend others to buy it full price like I did, because all in all, the book is rather ""ho-hum.""

I find it so helpful and relatable. I always thought to be original and I've to think everything out of nowhere. And this limitation of 100% originality directs us to frequently click backspace. The author not at all encouraged plagiarism but she asked us to copy and copy as she quote Yohji Yamamoto; “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy, you will find yourself.” This is an excellent piece of advice *_* ‘Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.’ The author told her readers to surround themselves with the best books, talented people and copy our ideals. As she quotes the German writer Goethe “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” “It is our failure to become our perceived ideals that ultimately define us and make us unique.” Did everything come from already present things? Nice :) “What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere.” A unique and out-of-the-box read for me and I like it. Excited to read more of Austin's work!"

Kleon encourages a creative life: to take up some messy hobby not because it's going to make you money and make you famous, but simply to refresh and revitalize your own brain. And I think that fits with the life of a Christian rejoicing in being like our Creator-Father. Best thing about it? I was expecting a fairly short book that would take me a few days to get through--but Kleon's little volume is a 6x6 square of inspirational paragraphs and Sharpie illustrations.

And in the process, sacrificing your innate creative bent. Comprising all of 133 pages, half of which are compelling illustrations and headline quotes set in font size a wee bit shorter than an advertisement hoarding, “Steal Like An Artist” leaves you feeling ambivalent. The experience is akin to that of a diner whose initial astonishment at the sheer exotic array of options promised to him, is dampened by the subsequent realisation that every single choice is either a translated version of or a cleverly disguised synonym for cabbage. But extremely and ‘cruciferously’ healthy, nonetheless. Kleon’s principles are very simple. “Steal but do not plagiarise.” You can emulate Rembrandt if he is your cup of tea. But please do not reproduce a Rembrandt and pass it off as a ‘rebrand’ (Ok he does not say it in as many words, but you get the message). Better still as Kleon suggests, hang pictures of your inspirations at the place of your work. “They are like friendly ghosts. I can almost feel them pushing me forward as I’m hunched over my guest.” I must have hung my heroes upside down because neither the ghost of Orwell nor the spirit of Hemingway have displayed even a modicum of altruism and wholeheartedness in lending a hand to their worshipper. The one principle which appealed to me and made me sit up is the one involving a mix of both analog and digital tools. Arguing that remaining perpetually hunched over a laptop has drained the modern day man of his creativity, Kleon exhorts us to use our hands whether it be writing or playing an instrument or engaging in craft. I couldn’t agree more. Nothing satisfies me more than scribbling a poem , even if it is absolute balderdash or malarkey using my fountain pen. Yet another dollop of wisdom has to do with the mischief of Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Kleon urges us to “Google everything”. Just to make sure you understand both the Noun and the succeeding pronoun very clearly, he continues: “I mean everything. Google your dreams, Google your problems. Don’t ask a question before you Google it. You’ll either find the answer or you’ll come up with a better question”. So basically you have a choice of ending up either a Cyberchondriac or a Donald Trump (is there a difference?) and everyone in between. A fantastic piece of advice is to carry a notepad/notebook (not the ones that made Michael Dell and Bill Gates who they are) and a pen wherever you happen to go. When artists such as David Hockney and Arthur Russell can get their clothes tailored in such a manner so as to facilitate stuffing of scrap papers and notepads, what prevents you from doing the same? I have personally been the beneficiary of this practice. I make it a point to always carry a note pad and a pen, both in the hopes that I will meet Salma Hayek one day and get her autograph and (mind you it is not an “or” but a vehement “and”) be so inspired by events unfolding around me that it makes me whip up a masterpiece akin to that penned by Friedreich Hayek! I have scribbled down a plethora of notes while commuting in public conveyances and while waiting to board one too. A curious piece of wisdom involves “marrying well”. Kleon asserts that “it takes a real champion of a person to be married to someone who’s obsessed with a creative pursuit.” Maybe Roger Federer can confirm this fact. Or would it be Mrs. Federer who would be most well equipped to corroborate this statement? My unmarried status precludes me from either refuting or agreeing with this particular philosophy. Keeping your day job whilst still hustling over the weekends and during times spent away from your day job is a very sensible suggestion. Just so that there is no confusion between livelihood and irrational exuberance, Kleon warns his readers to clearly demarcate between a steady job and creative activities. However one needs to make it clear that the day job needs to be such that it doesn’t want to make you vomit. While on days I have experienced mild bouts of regurgitation, I am yet to reach the retching phase of my profession. Touch wood! Kleon ends his book by giving a list of a few more books to read. Some of his recommendations being, “What is It” by Lynda Barry; “The Gift” by Lewis Hyde; “reality Hunger” by David Shields; “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lamott (I can vouch for this book personally. An absolute masterpiece). Let me end here. I need to take down the uncooperative duo of Messrs. Orwell and Hemingway and replace them with Ms. Virginia Woolf and Mr. J.R.R.Tolkien.

Look things up. Chase down every reference. Go deeper than anyone else - that’s how you’ll get ahead” ‘Where do you get your crazy ideas from’ - is always joked as one of the worst questions to ask entertainers. I’m not in any way artistic (nor an entertainer!) but I’m guessing that there’s a similar one for the artworld, and that it can sometimes be perceived as an attack on originality - are you the one true artist or can people dismiss your genius as blatant influence (“well you’re blatantly copying X from the classic Y genre so how is that even challenging the modern zeitgeist?!”). A book that throws these fears away and instead reminds that you being you and new is still innovative - be creative and inspired as and don’t be afraid! Also any book that quotes Rollins is always something I’m going to look into… Some of the many low level approaches I have taken to have some form of colourful or abstract creativity in my life: a portable printer during lockdown to diarise and decorate the house with easily; posh and trendy sets of coloured pens and pencils; different notebooks and a plethora of types of stationery including pencil pots and cases; iPad pencils (multiple!) for all the potential digital art and scribbles when a pen and paper aren’t close at hand; comedy and cute colouring books; unnecessarily personal detailed book reviews as a way of expressing where the book has taken me to mentally and I’ve felt… On a daily basis I choose to type and write as well as annotate printouts (the analog to digital back to analog loop), colour code, colour in notes, read and switch formats (for instance, as soon as I started reading and enjoying this library ebook version, I immediately bought the audiobook for myself, and looked to buy a print copy for the family!). Whilst easy to sneer at, is fan fiction a bad thing? Being a fan and expressing that through letters (which my father in law confessed to having done so just the week after I read this!). In a complete life metaphor it is about just filling blank space with the correct amount and knowing when to step back and announce that you’re satisfied and finished (often two very different feelings)… for the time being “When I get busy I get stupid…”"

At first, I said to myself, ""self, this is too obvious (just like this joke)."" But forty pages in, when I'd written down 5 quotes and drawn a few diagrams, I realized that sometimes the obvious is exactly what we need. This may not be new ground, but Kleon offers his advice in an entertaining manner, with a liberal dosing of quotes from famous people doled out along the way (my favorite, via Questlove: ""The only mofos in my circle are people that I can learn from.""). The central premise is that all art is theft, taken from somewhere else and filtered through the unique consciousness of the artist. And I love that I found it so pleasantly packaged, on a table ready for students to grab and devour (as soon as I return it). Too frequently we obsess over the proper citation of sources at the high school level. There is good reason for this. But students must also learn to repackage information in their own way, with their own spin. If I taught a comp or research methods class, I might make this required reading."

One: Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don't make excuses for not working - make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now. If you have two or three real passions, don't feel like you have to pick and choose between them. Don't discard. Keep all your passions in your life. So, basically, in summary: use whatever you have wherever you are, study the people you admire, get out of your comfort zone to go see the world out there for inspiration, explore all your passions and make 0 excuses about why you can't do the kind of art you want to do.

You have hit the nail on the head with your usual acuteness.""* There is nothing new under the sun. Creators are bound only to rework and reframe the same ideas and colors and sounds that generations have manipulated. Yet there is beauty in recognizing that collage of inspiration and a joyful hope in curating a collection of ideas to be repurposed and remade into something new and fresh. Kleon directs you to build on the mundane muse of life, to create in response to art (of any medium) that you enjoy, and to create what you would want to listen to/read/appreciate. Peppered with quotations, photos, and pen-and-ink drawings, it is a delivered in a light hand by a friendly artist sharing what worked best for him. And although I regretted its brevity because I so enjoyed the journey, I loved seeing the tidy and precise measure with which it was written. No thought is wasted, no concept is belabored, and Kleon trusts you to understand the basics and build with what you probably already know but may have needed reminding of. *Mr. Rochester to Jane in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte"

Though sometimes, imo, cliché is good. But when I find something like this, this idea of creativity and creative ethics & principles... I am mind blown despite the fact that some might argue that its not anything new, and to quote the book loosely, it isn't.

In other words, “novelty” refers to something that “I” know, but others do not."

My first drawing after reading just a few chapters, blew my mind away. It was a self-portrait and I could not believe that I had drawn it. After all, it takes months of practice not reading of a few chapters from a book to improve drawing, right? The downside is that you only learn to copy what you see in front of you. You don't learn how to use your drawing medium, nothing much about shadows, no anatomy, no perspective. The focus of the book is on portraits (Which the author rightly says is the hardest thing for artists and the most impressive). But once you're done with this book you must pickup some serious drawing book to improve, otherwise you will be stuck drawing nascent drawings (which you will enjoy neverthless :) ) I will definitely recommend this for those are just starting with their drawing. This book is helluva motivator! You'll see results quickly, but once done, move on!"

Part of the problem is that I become frustrated at how difficult it is to draw accurately and in proportion, and invariably put away my pencils and sketchbooks after a series of failures. And then, a year or two later, I try again, with a new how-to-draw book and vigor, only to repeat the process. Recently I unearthed my box of accumulated art supplies and drawing books, and noticed the orange spine of Betty Edwards . This is the most often recommended title for beginners. I recalled reading a bit of it years ago, and setting it aside because the exercises seemed rather complicated and required the use of tools. So, I decided to give it another try. I read it carefully from cover to cover before doing any drawing. Then, I ordered the recommended tools (these can be made inexpensively but I opted to just buy them from the author's website) and have been practicing these exercises ever since. Though much of information Edwards presents in her book isn't unique, the way she teaches it helped facilitate understanding for me in ways I never had before. My entire approach to drawing has changed dramatically and I finally feel like it is something I can eventually master. Edwards believes that drawing accurately is something can be taught, much like driving or learning a new language. Though some people will learn more quickly than others, most people can obtain a basic level of profiency through learning and practice. I don't know why I never thought about it like that before! Artistic talent is often though of as innate, but in reality it is a set of skills. Edwards contends that the only ""talent"" necessary for drawing is the ability to write legibly; if you can do that, you can learn to draw. Much of the beginning of the book sets forth Edwards' theory on neurology and how it affects the way we conceptualize drawing. Though most of this was written decades ago (the book has gone through several editions) and Edwards' theories about brain sided-ness have been disproven, a lot of her framework rings true. By necessity of language, people think symbolically - words represent objects. But, artists think visually and this is what she teaches - how to think and see like an artist. For example, if I were attempting to draw a lamp, Edward would suggest that I stop thinking of it as a lamp. It is a series of basic shapes that are connected to each other in various proportions. So, I would try to see the lamp as a partly a square connected to a cylinder, an oval, etc. By seeing objects as a sum of shapes, a beginning artist can resist the temptation to draw her own concept of what that object should look like. Edwards believes that this tendency to revert to symbolic thinking is what hampers beginning artist. She illustrates this concept brilliantly in a fascinating early chapter about children's drawings, showing how almost universally, children adopt symbols representative of what they wish to draw. Heads are circles, smiles are elongated ""U""s. Once this pattern gets set cognitively, it's difficult to draw a head that isn't a circle. And heads are not circles! Edwards takes the reader through a series of exercises to show how much we tend to draw symbolically. In one exercise, a line drawing of a seated man is flipped upside down and we are instructed to draw it. It forces us to draw visually, as our brain doesn't process upside-down drawings as symbols. I remember drawing the circles of the man's glasses, not even realizing what they were! Most people will draw the upside-down image than the right-side up image. Each subsequent chapter introduces various accuracy skills: sighting, scaling, etc. She employs time honored tools such as picture planes to assist the beginner in seeing their subjects visually. Later chapters address drawing faces and using color. But I am really happy that I re-read this book and dived into its challenges. Thanks to Betty Edwards for teaching so many people that they can learn to draw. Postscript: As a person with a debilitating disabling illness, drawing is a bit of a challenge. I've found ways to work around some of the things that prevented me from trying (again). First, I made a place for my drawing materials where they could be easily accessible, and easily stored away: a nightstand drawer. I draw in a reclined position, with my sketchbook propped up on my knees, so I am comfortable. Some of the exercises require an hour or more of work; these I break up into smaller sessions, and I amend some of the suggested subjects if they are not suitable to my arrangement."

He wasn’t quite successful, but he did remind me of this book and that has to be a good thing. I read this book about ten years ago at a dark time in my life when I had just separated and moved out from the ex-wife. I had never been any good at drawing and generally hated books that went on about the right brain / left brain distinction – so I’ve no idea why I picked this up. But I did pick it up and almost immediately became fascinated. You see, it diagnosed my problem with drawing in the first couple of pages and then gave me clear and competent instruction into how to make me a better drawer. For years at Primary and High School I had sat in art classes and learnt next to nothing. I wasn’t exactly the naughtiest boy in the class, I would sit and do whatever was asked of me, but all of my ‘art’ was pitifully bad. Like getting a dyslexic to read Shakespeare aloud for the class, there was something cruel in putting a pencil or paint brush into my hand. The problem was no one ever told me that you need to draw what you see – that is, literally what you see, not what you think you see. When we are kids we learn to draw ‘symbols’ of things. We draw triangles for noses and spread out heart shapes for mouths. But these symbols are not what people actually have. People have real eyes and real chins, not a collection of symbols. Just learning that, and that alone, was enough to change the way I drew. The point wasn’t to draw mouths and ears, it was to draw lines and shade and shapes. The other thing this book really taught me was the idea of flow. That being totally engaged in something is about living outside of time. I’m never going to spend enough time drawing to become a good drawer, but this book taught me that becoming a good drawer isn’t something that is genetically beyond me (something I pretty much assumed must have been the case previously). It taught me that the beauty of drawing is in how lost one becomes while drawing – as one does when writing poetry or extended prose. Time melts away. The point of drawing is to melt time, not really to produce great drawings. And this book taught me how to look. It made trips to the art gallery so much more interesting and worthwhile. The drawing exercises in this book should be virtually compulsory in schools. As a child who would, when asked to draw, scribble something tiny in the upper corner of the page – someone afraid of the momentum of lines (something I’m still afraid of) this book was like a light being turned on in a very dark room I had spent a lifetime stumbling around in. For years afterwards I would sit in meetings drawing my left hand. Like I said, Art teachers should be using this book as a matter of course. If you can’t draw a face without blushing, please, read this book – it will show you what the kids at school who could draw worked out on their own and why, without being shown, you never really had a chance of learning."

I mean, really. My drawings at this stage without too much more practice resemble the album covers of emo-teens with acoustic guitars, but I am certainly doing much better than Napoleon Dynamite. Big time. I think the approach to art that it presents is really intriguing - that we are primarily hammered into left-brain dominance through the acquisition of language - and it is through a reconnection with defamiliarization and the foreign thought process of our childhood that we can shed this brain drain we have lived with for so long since elementary school. I still have a long way to go with this - I find that symbols are constantly at war with my conceptualization of the world (and strangely I am wondering if that takes away the beauty with which we see it, after all, a rose is a rose is a rise, right?) - but this book is certainly a big step in shedding the messed up approaches to visual thinking that I have acquired. As a writer I am at an even bigger disadvantage, but I am on my way. I have learned a great deal more than any other drawing manual I have encountered so far, and it really helps to understand that it is not me - that anyone could be a good illustrator given the correct parameters and education on the visual arts."

This is a very popular title that frequently pops up when people ask for recommendation on books that teach drawing. Reviews on Amazon are overwhelmingly positive, which is not a surprise. This book not only teaches you how to think (and not think) when drawing, but also teaches you the techniques to draw. In short, it teaches the approach and the techniques. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain works on the premise that the right side of the brain is more suited for drawing, and teaches you how to engage it for drawing purposes. The different chapters are on contour drawings, negative space, sighting, portrait drawings, colors, light and shadow. At the end is an additional chapter on handwriting art. There are easy step-by-step exercises to follow along. Results will be visible but all the exercises must be done. Perfection requires more practice, of course. The techniques can be easily applied to challenging tasks like drawing foreshortening or a realistic portrait. One thing I noticed on online art forums is, beginners generally like the book. Those who have been drawing for a while say that left & right brain thing is more marketing and drawing is just about focusing. The thing is, this book provides the basic techniques to get people started. And yes, I did read everything and went through the exercises, which aren't really too hard. This book is highly recommended to beginners learning to draw."

It immeadiately changed the way I viewed things. It was one of the pivotal books of my life (I ought to include that as a tag.) When I home-schooled my then suicidal teen daughter and sat her down with this book, she flipped through it for 15 minutes, and started drawing as if she had been taking lessons her whole life. She found a talent she didn't know she had (and several others, but not because of this book.) I highly recommend it for anyone who says ""I can't even draw a stick figure."" This book may change your mind."

For those with the heart of an artist but none of the talent (like me), it teaches a whole new way to look at and draw things. I remember that I enjoyed many hypnotic mellow hours practicing what I was reading. I also remember that if you concentrate on the the shape of the spaces and shadows instead of the lines of an object, you can draw a pretty accurate picture/portrait."

I've never drawn from life before (only from two-dimensional photographs), but already a few lessons in, I've been doing so (see images below, which were done in an 8-day period)! Progress is impressively rapid with this method. I've never had more fun with a book! We're using this as a homeschool art curriculum and will continue to use it through the 2012-2013 school year. I think of this main text as the ""teacher text."" It has long but interesting explanations about how the right and left hemispheres of the brain function, and how to access the parts needed to draw what you see. This is overkill for younger students (which is why I recommend the accompanying workbook as a ""student text"" since it gets down to the bare-bones of drawing.) The author divides drawing into 5 basic skills: the perception of edges, the perception of spaces (negative space), the perception of relationships (sighting perspective & proportions), the perception of lights & shadows, and perception of the whole. The DVD will give you a crash course of the book. I highly recommend viewing the entire thing before beginning to draw, as it makes the material in the book so clear and your progress will be rapid. The book will allow you to dig deeper into the concepts briefly presented on the DVD. One of the interesting things about this book is that its principles can be applied to other creative endeavors beyond drawing. I see applications for writers here, too. Here are some of my own drawings so far: Lesson 3 of the DVD: My Hand (perception of edges) Lesson 4 of the DVD: Chair (perception of negative spaces) Lesson 5 of the DVD: ""Doorway"" (perception of relationships) If you want a hassle-free way to get all the drawing materials you'll need for this book, go to the .

One's beliefs would be justified, as the book follows the left-right-brain story intently. It's not really the crux of the book, however. From my perception of the book, it is easy and sometimes necessary to separate the scientific motivations behind Edwards' drawing exercises from their rationales and ultimately their results. One enters the book with an explanation for the average person's inability to draw from observation; that is, that drawing for most people is dominated by the symbolic, analytical, linguistic, mathematical chunk of the brain, the studious Left Hemisphere. Hence, the simple barrier to learning to draw from observation is allowing the creative, objective, and somewhat whimsical Right to handle the observation for us. One can benefit from the insights held in this book without the left-right narrative, but the science behind them might, rightly, goad into drawing those who describe themselves as ""not really artsy"". To a high degree, that's just the person the book is largely marketed to: a person with little experience and asymptotically little interest in drawing. That being said, whether you're a hobbyist or someone just beginning their tortuous self-criticising art career, pick up this book, give it a good read, and do the exercises if you think they'll help. Do that, and pay no more heed afterward to this book, for it limits you intently in what it advises you do to draw well. After looking through this book I very quickly turned to Burne Hogarth, Andrew Loomis, and Robert Beverly Hale, authors who focus primarily on figure drawing for illustration. Their instructions rely heavily on exactly what Edwards warns against: drawing figures by relating a system of symbols to one's perception. In the years since reading DRSB, I can safely say the authors listed prior have given me far more tools for drawing well. Edwards' book is a good primer if you want to learn to draw accurately; if you want to draw masterfully and effortlessly, however, your only venue is, in the end, practice."

I picked it up because I'd heard lots of good things about it, because I could stand to be a lot more creative, and because I couldn't draw to save my life. It's true that the author is prone to wax poetic about the drawing process; at one point, for instance, she suggests you draw the folds in your palm without looking at your palm, and calls the result a ""beautiful record of consciousness"". However, It's also true that this book made a huge difference in my ability to draw what I see, especially given how little time I was able to spend working through the examples. I've never taken an art-related class in my life so every method was new to me. Just using a few of her recommendations (drawing negative spaces, for example, and trying to keep from naming what you're drawing) produced a shocking difference in how my drawings turned out. One excellent attribute of this book is that you can do most of the exercises with just a paper and pencil. The author recommends that you buy graphite and a special frame and bond paper and all kinds of other things, and I'm sure they're helpful, but in the end what you're doing here is pencil drawings, which everyone has already done in meetings and classes. This book did not make me an amazing artist, but I cannot imagine a more immediately practical and helpful guide for someone who just wants to be able to draw--like, yesterday. 5 stars. My one beef with this book is that it claims to be a handbook for increasing creativity, but the book is really only about one thing: . That means you can draw from still life, or from someone sitting very still for half an hour. With regards to creativity, the author has several markedly defensive paragraphs in which she points out that there are modes for self-expression within the realistic format (for instance, you can use cross-hatching to create a darker area OR follow the contours of the subject!). I was hoping, however, that this book would show me some methods for drawing realistic people and scenes, and at this task it was not very helpful."

It took me a while to read since I followed all of the exercises, to get anything out of this book I recommend doing the exercises (otherwise I'm not sure any of it would make sense) One could make a strong argument against the ""R-mode"" and ""L-mode"" naming conventions, however, the very proven pedagogical basis is hard to fault. Call it ""accessing your visual cortex"" if you don't like ""R-mode"", but the end result is the same. But still, there were at times too much emphasis on Right vs Left The handwriting section at the end was thoughtful, although a little forced as it seems bad handwriting is a pet-peeve of the author. Despite that, I found treating handwriting as an art to be as fun and engaging as the other exercises."

It helps new artists to push beyond what they think things should look like to actually seeing what they look like. If you're thinking of starting drawing as a hobby, you can't go wrong with this. There is a short section at the end of the book where the author tries to apply the core skills of drawing to the decision making process in an effort to make drawing skills seem more necessary. I didn't feel that section worked very well."

Whether it's the right side or the left side or your knees that do the thinking, its quite irrelevant and I wish the author didn't put so much stake on the dubious inner workings and preliminary science of the mind. What is useful is the series of exercises that allow students to disconnect from the symbolic and verbal way of thinking when taking a realistic approach to drawing. This goes for painting as well in many aspects. I think the leap in confidence the book allows is remarkable for the immense majority of people that have allowed their logic to interfere with the proper way of seeing and translating what one sees, not merely as things but as shapes. I also liked the author's take on children and preadolescent art. Unlike many psychologists that ascribe convoluted theories to children's drawings, the author looks here for consequences of developing a language of symbols in the formal evolution of art while striving for realism and loosing the natural instinct for composition in the process. This is a great book to start. But once you've mastered the idea and are able to go into the trance, drawing what is in front of you, observing contours and negative shapes and generally looking without thinking , the next phase involves some serious , ahem, left brain activity. A realistic drawing is within reach but now you'll need to move on and make a good drawing. For that, there are plenty of other great books out there that will teach perspective (this book reduces it to a useful but limited extension of the previous techniques of mirroring the sighting), the creation of volume from within the figure, composition, edge and tone manipulation, etc. The power of achieving a qualitative step cannot be understated and therefore I recommend this book and its exercises with no reserves. Just don't get too enamored with which part of the brain is doing the work. I think that sells books but it might not be as useful to you."

It's actually got some good ideas in there, with alot of jargon that I didn't understand (and didn't really care to, you don't miss much). Looking back, I appreciate some of the lessons I learned from it. Even if you think you can't draw, give this a chance! Forget that you think all your drawings look like a kid's, and try it, it really was good for me. The main idea seems to be that we draw what we THINK we see, not what we actually see, because our brain interprets it on the way from our eye to our hand. It's so true! We did a lot of drawing from photographs turned upside down, to disguise the subject so that our brain didn't interpret it, and I think that was a good way to train your eye to see the real shapes. Of course, you still turn your picture around from time to time to get a good overview and see if things fit which you might have missed before, but overall the upside down method was useful for me when I was learning. That said, I really really HATED the portraits. Faces are a naturally complex subject to draw, and they are hardest to draw in pencil, and much easier with charcoal. I firmly am of the opinion that learning the anatomical rules to a face - learning to draw each of the parts separately, then how the head is proportioned and where the parts actually go on it (not just where we think they go), then combining the two - is a much better approach. Oh, and I really hated the hand drawings... where you draw your hand without looking at the paper. I understand the point was to train your hand and your eye to go at the same pace, but frankly I don't see anything wrong with looking at your paper and felt it was a dumb exercise every time I did it. Which was alot."

If nothing else, the idea that drawing is not a matter of manual dexterity (according to Edwards if can write decently, you can draw), it is a matter of how you look at objects and interpret it on paper was a boon. It made me stop thinking that I couldn't draw, and I couldn't learn to draw. I mean you must be able to learn to draw; think back to the days when an ""accomplished"" lady had to be able to speak Italian and do watercolors! Edwards uses a lot of jargon about the sides of the brain and modes, but basically the book boils down to the following: Instead of actually drawing what we really see, most of us try to draw symbols of what we see. It is really amazing--try it. Really examine objects and try to represent them on paper. I found that when I let my attention wander I would draw a line slanting the wrong way or the wrong length because I unconsciously slipped back into the mode of drawing what I thought the object looked like--not what it really looked like.[return][return]My biggest gripe about Edwards is her before and after portraits. Don't feel discouraged about them. In her seminars she has students use one method of drawing for the before and another method using charcoals for the after. Faces are hard anyway, and the charcoal makes it easier."

Betty Edwards seems to express herself quite well in the way she teaches and the methods she uses to bring an absolute beginner from nothing to actually having a chance at art. She focuses so much on activating the creative side of the brain, or the right side of the brain. In order to do that, she teaches you how to train your eyes to see properly and then drawing exactly what you see and not what you think you see. The text in this book is well worth the read so if you are thinking of buying this book, make sure you are willing to sit down and just read and read. It’s truly rich in its content. The book also includes exercises you should do in order to advance from being a simple beginner in art.

I sense it was more to say that L-hemisphere is not artistry and R-hemisphere is. - The last two chapters of the book I sensed was more about the Author's own opinions about the way she can use the tools rather than actual facts. One can have theories and create a lot of opinions on how to fit them into reality but do that really work? - A lot of self-theories but not real facts. I sense a deep explanation of her beliefs but zero proof for it. When it comes to things like explaining scientific concepts like the brain. Where are the graphics, documents, pictures? I understand there isn't the ""perfect"" book of art and I learned a few things reading this book. I followed all her drawing instructions but at the end... things like shadow/light are lacking explanation."

Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is definitely a resource I plan to keep around. Art is something that has always escaped me. I remember in elementary school there was a teacher who walked around to different classrooms with a cart teaching art, but that is all I remember. I do not remember any of our classes or really learning anything in that situation. I remember doing kits from a hobby store and learning different things that way, but the only one that stuck with me was cross stitch and later in my married life quilting. In first grade I won first price for a coloring contest, drawing and coloring, but that was just me having fun. I never learned any real skills. There was one summer, I think it must have still been in my elementary school years, where I took all sorts of classes on pottery and drawing and other things in artistic pursuit. I loved it, but nothing ever went any further. My schools did not have art classes after that, until I entered high school, but those classes were all advanced and for people that had been involved in art their whole lives so it was too late to get started. Now, a decade later I'm shown that it is not too late and that I indeed can learn to draw. That's fascinating! I have an advanced reader copy edition so I cannot promise that the final press print would appear like this. In my edition they are all black and white and some are quite dim and hard to see. But the real treasure in this book is not just in the images and examples but in the text. Reading through this book the student has a great teacher that cares about the skill of learning to draw. Yet there is more in psychology and neuroscience mentioned as well as teaching direction to draw. It is not surprising after reading through Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain that this is ""the world's most widely used drawing instruction book"". I agree that this book is written for all in the professional, academic and even hobbyist frame of mind. *Thanks to Tarcher/Penguin for providing an ARC for review.* posted:"

As it turns out I was right and glad I bought it too, it is amazing! Betty wrote it very clear, concise and simple to understand especially for the beginner in mind. I like the fun little exercises inside too. And you know what? They really work! Know keep in mind I was just a beginner then and when I would finish an exercise and find out to my surprise that I had actually had done a good job I was excited as every novice is probably. Sometimes I go to my shelf and pull it for old times sake. I think this book is timeless, it should be read by anyone deciding to begin a life as an Artist. Of course I gave it 5 stars...

It involves creating something out of nothing, after all. With simple strokes on paper, we can trick our brains into believing there is something more than just lines. It's truly powerful stuff when you think about it, but then why is it so hard to just copy what you see? is a guide aimed at those who think they will never be able to master this particular craft. Through practical exercises and insights, Betty Edwards teaches readers to enhance their drawing skills by tapping into the brain's right hemisphere, which is responsible for creativity and visual perception. One of the things that makes drawing from life so difficult is that our brain likes to play tricks on us. In most circumstances, this makes life much easier: our mind basically fills in the blanks, and we perceive things more wholly than we do. When it comes to drawing, logic and rationality can suddenly become a hinderance: we simply won't believe that one chair leg appears shorter than the other because we that they are all the same. What this book teaches is how to overcome those blockades. As an illustrator, drawing is literally my job, so I might not be the target audience for this, yet I had great fun exploring this very conscious way of approaching something that has long become second nature to me. I did all the exercises and was surprised by the results. By changing up little things, recreating what's in front of you suddenly becomes easy and accessible. I also enjoyed how Edwards conveyed the idea of drawing being more than just creating art, but instead being a fundamental way of understanding our world. By engaging with it in this way, we perceive reality more accurately and foster creative thinking. I think this is a great read for anyone who has stopped drawing as an adult, thinking that they are just no good at it. It's an unintimidating and approachable introduction to the subject!"

If you have been wanting to draw since childhood, but never managed to draw properly or scared of picking up drawing, please give this book a try. I can draw decently. I have done some good realistic sketches. But I didn’t know what to do next to improve my skills. This book helped me a lot in that journey. I didn’t really believe in all the pseudoscientific information she gave about brain workings. But her points about how to see and draw were really helpful. If you’re going to read this book, I highly recommend you to do all the exercises without skipping any. Don’t skip the viewfinder and picture plane. Use an old rectangular photo frame as your viewfinder/picture plane. I used a 2B pencil, regular eraser, sharpener , regular paper and a photo frame to do all the exercises. Don’t let the lack of supplies stop you. I can’t stress enough: do the exercises from each chapter before moving on to the next chapter. Cons: I felt like the chapter about shades was very weak. The book mainly focuses on portraits. Author said that portraits are intimidating, so doing them well will boost our confidence. That’s true. But I guess we can succeed only when we keep practicing and transfer the skills that we learned in this book to other areas of drawing."

It delves into the mysteries of the mind. It explores all the roadblocks that the pesky left brain builds to keep us from being the next Leonardo da Vinci. This is actually the book form of a live, instructional course taught by the writer. So there are mental exercises that are used to strengthen the right brain and force the left brain into the background. This is both a positive and negative. It’s positive in the fact that there is some instruction that leads you along a path. Some other art books tend to speak of ‘ideas’ but don’t really tell you how to achieve an idea. The negative is that it becomes slightly tedious to read. Almost like programming a VCR. Do people still do that? How about putting together a kid’s toy? Anyways, once you do the exercise a few times, you’ll have the method memorized. Do they actually help? Yes, I believe so. It tells you why you can’t draw and describes an exercise to get over a particular shortcoming. I think ‘natural’ artists tend to see the world differently and this book, if you put in a lot of time, will help you see the world that way. Is it a quick fix? No, you will have to spend months doing the exercises over and over. If you don’t want to draw, the book is still interesting as it explains a few facts about the human mind. Explaining why people tend to fear drawing once they get older. Why it is so hard to draw in perspective. Also how the two sides of the brain interact and how the left brain is a bully.

This is a wonderful book in teaching you how to see, and then how to draw. Essentially, to be able to draw is not about the skill of the hand but the ability of the eye to see. The exercises help you learn to see: 1)edges (contours) 2)negative space 3)perspective and proportion and using a basic unit as measurement 4)light and shadow 5)wholeness I think it is important to do all the exercises as it did give me a little more confidence. These are 5 essential skills, and as we move along to learn about colours and the use of other mediums, we still need these 5 skills. The last 2 skills (not taught in the book but mentioned) in art is drawing from memory and from imagination. But these need to be built on the first five. I am very glad to have read this book, as there are many drawing books in the market and from what I see, many are not very useful because they teach techniques but not how to see."

The key being that this book teaches you how to 'see'. In order to draw with accuracy it is necessary to let go of your preconceived notions about what things 'should' look like and using symbols to represent features rather than observing what is actually there. This book is an amazing tool for learning how to work with your own brain and become really observant and powerful artistically. I have seen it make a huge impact on my art and that of others I know. I also noted when I first read this book that my first art teacher in school used some of the early assignments to teach us to draw.

This book helped me discover the joy of drawing realistically, especially capturing portraits. When I was a young teenager, this book resonated deeply with me. I remember doing the exercises in it from cover to cover. I grew in my mastery of drawing, and in expertise at capturing a likeness on paper. I was also able to use the book as a jumping-off point in teaching my own art students. While the book doesn't encompass everything—layout, composition, color theory, abstraction, etc—its core message of mastering draftsmanship is invaluable.

Betty convinces you that you can draw no matter what... maybe part of it is that placebo effect but that never worked for me before :P Anyways she has alot of good information in the book, she also has some exercises I found helpful in forcing your mind to study a image and each part of it in concordance with other parts to attempt to more accurately depict your drawing. In other words it helps your image stay as close in proportions to the original as possible. Unbelievably to me it worked the first time, I mean my drawing was no where near perfect but it was much better in proportion than any previous drawing I had ever done. I was quite surprised. While this information is helpful and the book will certainly make you a better artist there is nothing like practice. Unless you practice alot you will go nowhere so keep that in mind :)"

I don't disregard it because I have seen myself draw a few things that I never thought I could manage. However, when I'm not doing the specific exercises my drawing is no where near the quality of what the book claimed I should see.

Well-written with many examples and pertinent figures. I Loved the before and after drawings of Art Students, done just 3 days apart with a remarkable improvement. There were many drawings of professional artists as well as drawings by Edwards and her fellow teachers. I loved the explanation (and it made so much sense) why most Art Teachers are so shitty at actually teaching students how to draw. Every art class I have taken started with a long list of very costly materials which I then had to go out and buy on a very limited budget--and then the ""teaching"" consisted of using the materials like ink or charcoal, making a huge mess with them and creating something no one (least of all me) wanted to look at, and the course ended with the expensive materials being stashed away to dessicate never to be used again. One beginning art class project consisted of creating ""art"" by cutting up the comics pages in newspapers and pasting them into an abstract collage. [The Art Teacher was so impressed by my newsprint project result they showed it to other classes as a shining example--which was mildly gratifying but not really. All I wanted was to LEARN HOW TO DRAW--or at least improve.] My least favorite word (in regards to Art) is Multimedia--this guarantees I am going to hate the finished product. Betty Edwards explains why drawing is so hard to teach, discusses the barriers to learning how to draw, and gives step by step exercises to teach the skills to oneself and students. There is an emphasis on drawing human faces. I loved learning about proportions of faces and doing so, I was able ""see"" better than I ever have before. I will confess that I did not do all the exercises--but I did many of the ones that didn't require buying any materials, I plan to do a few others from this book, and have seen my drawing skill improve. These techniques are perfect to build on. Edwards' advice is spot on and she seems like a wonderful person based on how she writes about teaching and learning. Highly recommend this book to: anyone with an interest in How To Draw, Art appreciation, or Teaching Art."

I have been drawing since I was a kid, and in this context, I could see that a lot of what she was explaining I already kind of did it in an intuitive way. It was actually very interesting from that point of view, because I could see how someone who has always thought that they just don't have the talent to draw could really find this book useful, because it teaches you basic aspects of how to see reality in a way that, at the very least, you can copy it way more accurately. The method that she proposes, at least the one that I remember the most, of converting ·3D objects in 2D in your mind so you can see the proportions and distances more clearly it was interesting. Having said that, It wasn't really that useful for me, it was more like an interesting exercise and explanation. But I could also see the not so good part of the book, which is that in a way it can reinforce a tendency (that I already had) to ""flatten"" the way you see objects and reality and thus not making easier certain important processes that an artist has to learn, like being able to construct objects in perspective in your mind to be able to draw them from any angle. Basically, it's a book that it's better for people that think that they can't draw, and in any case, an interesting read, although I don't completely like her approach that she takes."

As a kid I loved it but haven't drawn a thing in years (though always liked the idea of ""being able to draw""). Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a highly recommended and insanely popular book on learning to draw. And I can see why, as it's power to motivate and get you drawing is immense. The book starts by asking you to sketch a few pre-instruction drawings. This includes a self-portrait, a drawing of your hand, and a drawing of the corner of your room. The book is genius in that it does this so you have a baseline and can compare your later improved drawings to these earlier attempts. This contrast between caveman level inscription and reasonably recognisable drawing with some semblance of shape and form is Betty Edwards way of visually showing your progress as you work through the chapters. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain starts with a focus on edges and negative space, then moves onto proportions and perspective, before looking at things like shading, composition, and hatching. But through each chapter of drawing tutorial, the book is teaching the most fundamental art skill on earth, the art of truly seeing. The book dives into the key concept of seeing exactly what is in front of you rather than what your brain is perceiving it to be, and by doing this it teaches that drawing from life or reference is nothing more than putting down exactly what you see. By completely changing the way you perceive and think during the drawing process, even simple sketching becomes remarkably entertaining (and the results also show an immediately clear improvement). The structure of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the key to its success. By taking you through each section and building on each previous lesson/skill, the book gradually expands the way you think as you draw, while improving basic drawing skills too. The steady progression and mix of simple exercises to more rewarding pieces always feels fulfilling, making this one of the most positively inspiring books to follow through with. The science behind the whole right brain/left brain thing may be complete junk (or at best inconclusive), yet even as a metaphor rather than scientific fact, it still applies very well. And while the science itself is not touched on much here, some chapters going into topics like the way drawings change and adapt in children as they age prove to be fascinating. My one criticism is that while there's plenty more reading needed to build on the starter skills taught here, this book gives very little guidance on where to go next, or how best to maintain the progress made here. This book took me from being someone who ""would love to be able to draw"" to someone who draws, and that alone pretty much says it all. 5 left-sided stars."

No wonder the college drawing class that required this book frustrated so many of its students as much as it taught them. Having re-read this book in its entirety, I have to say that it's a wonder any of us continued to draw after graduating that class. If you can ever get past the horrendously warped theology and the interesting, but ultimately aimless ramble through neuroscience, there’s a fairly decent introduction to some useful drawing skills in the final few chapters of this book. But getting there is such a chore... Betty Edwards has a lot of good techniques to teach beginners (eventually), but her assumption that we must achieve an altered state of consciousness and “shut down” one half of our minds in order to draw effectively is ludicrous at best—dangerous at worst. The author treats the left hemisphere of the brain as if it’s the villain of a story, and proceeds for chapter upon chapter of theory-crafting in order to convince us of its villainy and teach her readers to silence all thought and perception provided by said hemisphere in order to achieve a perfect state of mind in which to “really see”—thereby intentionally causing frustration, confusion, and a reliance on this trance-like state in order to ever draw. (You might think I’m stretching that a bit and being too harsh, but I’m not. The author herself admits as much multiple times right there in the text.) If you can wade past all of that, however, the actual drawing instructions in chapters 6-11 are quite well written and educational. Mercifully, this section of the book is relatively free of the author’s meandering theories. In the back half of the book you’ll find wonderfully simple-to-comprehend lessons on perspective, sighting, portraiture, foreshortening, negative space, shading, and a short lesson on colour theory. Things that are when learning to improve your drawing skills. If you’re interested in studies about the brain, I highly recommend reading the first few chapters (with a grain of salt, of course, and understanding that the actual scientific research she references has likely advanced beyond the contents of those chapters in recent years). But if you simply want to learn to draw, I recommend at most skimming the first few chapters—avoiding like the plague the exercises on achieving an altered-state of consciousness (shifting from the so-called “L-mode” to “R-mode”)—and starting with a more thorough reading and working through the drawing exercises beginning in chapter six. Learn the techniques for measuring and sighting, for observing lights, shadows, shapes, and spaces, and let the rest of it go. No trance necessary."

I'm a novice artist. I had heard alot about this book so thought Id give it a read. Firstly, it's filled long winded psychobabble. The whole left and right side of the brain fighting for tasks is outdated. She talks about this alot, when really I only wanted to get to the exercices. But the exercises felt somewhat pointless. One exercise, drawing upside down, I did fine with this, but not, I think because it was upside that but because I'm not a complete beginner. A couple of years ago I had tried this upside down drawing and hated it. It was terrible and I hated the assumption that it would be good. Betty does the same. After each exercice she tells you that she's sure you will be pleased. For those who aren't, I think this will be frustrating to read. I found the blind drawing exercise, strange and not something I'll do again. I don't see it teaching me to pay more attention to what i actually see. In fact I think it would make me pay less attention, because there are no real results. Betty neglects to inform her readers that drawing takes practice and repetition. You will likely have to do a task multiple times before you improve. I do find the viewfinder and plastic sheet a good explanation for how to draw what you see for beginners. I didn't try it as I didnt have materials but I can see that clicking for beginners. I quit the book shortly after this. Tired with her waffle. I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do decide to give it a try these are the materials you need. -Clear plastic, about 8x10"" and 1/16 thick -two ""viewfinders"" made of black card-board, about 8x10 -non-permanent black felt-tip marker -graphite stick #4B -masking tape -eraser -two bidner clips"

In the 1950s Roger Sperry studied split brain patients, mostly epileptics whose corpus callosum had been cut. That research has been out of date since 1970. Unless you're a split brain patient, you do not do types of activities such as drawing with only 1 side of your brain. You use all of your brain. Except for handedness, lateralisation is very minor. She would have been more accurate if she had said paint in a creative mode, not an analytical mode. Something along the lines of paint like you’re feeling the subject. Don't paint like a engineer. Don't tell yourself ""I’m painting an eye. That's an eye. Make it look like an eye."" Instead, observe the eye. Paint the light . Paint what you see, not what you tell yourself you see based on preconceive notions of what you think you remember an eye looks like. The main point is to learn to see. Her science is wrong, but the idea that you need to stop being over analytical and logicical is right.. Despite her lack of understanding of science, the book helped me improve my drawing and painting skills."

It forces you to loose all of your natural style and original artistic talent to learn to draw just like everyone else. This book was used in my college Drawing I class and it was honestly awful. I literally burned my copy of it so no one else would read it. I'm not saying it can't help you, maybe if you have no drawing skills whatsoever... but for me it really messed me up and set me back when I thought that I already had some natural ability.

But the theory is mostly something you can casually consider in broad terms while still trying to change the way you approach and think about drawing, and I think that's a fairly useful framework for trying things a different way. It was helpful to a point for me, and included some exercises I had done before in art classes but that are perennially useful to play with, like blind contour drawing and drawing what you literally see instead of what you imagine a thing to look like. It didn't unlock the secrets of drawing for me, but it did lead to some helpful experiments and a few things I will take with me as I try to not be tragically terrible at drawing."

A classic for a reason. There are a few ideas in it which are in dispute - namely, that ""right-brained"" work flow allows you to ""zone in"" like an athlete during a perfect performance. Even if you don't buy into this, there is something to be said about how ""zoning in"" lets you work more freely, and focus on the ""working"" aspect of the drawing rather than the ""what to draw next..."" aspect. She in fact teaches that you will eventually draw like an autonomous drawing robot in full gear. What does have value is her chapters on children's drawing, drawing left-handed, and her section on the intersections of handwriting and drawing."

Two stars says it is ""ok"" and I guess it is okay for most people even with the flawed idea that our right and left brains are somehow separate.

This work was one of the author's first practical educational applications of Roger Sperry's pioneering insight into the dual nature of human thinking... ""verbal, analytic thinking mainly located in the left hemisphere, and visual, perceptual thinking mainly located in the right hemisphere."" The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; the right hemisphere controls the left side. ""Left-handers excel in mathematics, music, and chess. And the history of art certainly gives evidence of an advantage for left-handedness: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael were all left-handed."" We are provided with drawing exercises and ample instruction to proceed with developing our abilities with drawing along with the five basic skills of drawing: One: the perception of edges, Two: the perception of spaces, Three: the perception of relationships, Four: the perception of lights and shadows, and Five: the perception of the whole, or gestalt. Drawing materials are also listed in detail for each drawing exercise. Upside-down drawing is an exercise that reduces mental conflict and the use of this gap in the abilities of the left hemisphere to allow R-mode to have a chance to take over for a while. This work will enable individuals to express themselves in drawing, the nonverbal language of art. As we have experienced, a contributing factor in the decline in right-brain centered academics throughout educational institutions during the early adolescent school years and beyond, have successfully precluded the natural development and intelligence growth significantly amongst the populous over the past few decades... and this will, no doubt, continue, producing additional lower-level-intelligence generations in future years. ""The right brain—the dreamer, the artificer, and the artist—is lost in our school system and goes largely untaught."" (See other works' right-brain science research related to Savant Syndrome for additional and current information on this important area of examination) This instructional work will assist the beginning reader-artist with essential tools to overcome many, if not all, childhood and preconceived drawing habits. If drawing is of no interest to the reader, this work may become tedious at times; if one is not inclined to 'structural' exercises, then this may not be a good work for them to consider. - Excerpts: ""Public-school teachers are also using my book. After twenty-five years of budget cuts in schools' arts programs, I am happy to report that state departments of education and public-school boards of education are starting to turn to the arts as one way to help repair our failing educational systems. Educational administrators, however, tend to be ambivalent about the purpose of including the arts, often still relegating arts education to 'enrichment'. This term's hidden meaning is 'valuable but not essential.'"" Author Betty Edwards PhD ""All of the exercises in this book, therefore, are based on two organizing principles and major aims. First, to teach the reader five basic component skills of drawing and, second, to provide conditions that facilitate making cognitive shifts to R-mode [Right Brain}, the thinking/seeing mode specialized for drawing."" ""In English, left comes from the Anglo-Saxon lyft, meaning 'weak' or 'worthless.'"" ""THE MAJORITY OF ADULTS IN THE WESTERN WORLD do not progress in art skills much beyond the level of development they reached at age nine or ten."" ""Beginners often think that drawing people is the hardest of all kinds of drawing. It isn't, actually. As with any other subject matter, the visual information is right there, ready and available.""

I know nothing about art theory, the last few times I picked up a brush was to paint a wall, and any time I spend with a pencil is usually to furiously scribble down notes. Trust me when I say I'm a total beginner. I always had the feeling I was lacking the talent for the arts, the flair for the creative, the discerning eye and steady hands that create beloved pieces for the world to see... As it turns out, this book was meant for me, and for anyone else out there with the mentality that they don't have that ""special something"" - it's a common feeling and, just as it was with me, a big blocker for most people to get started earnestly. Dr. Edwards addresses this directly as she makes the case for the importance of drawing: drawing, like anything, is a skill that can be learned, and is an important tool to teach perceptual training (a function of the oft-ignored right hemisphere of the brain, she says). Makes sense to me - I'm down with the cause! So I head to the nearest Dollarama, buy a sketch pad and some pencils, start following along with Dr. Edwards as she starts laying out theories on brain hemispheres, and seriously spend time with the various drawing exercises she details. Over the course of the book Dr. Edwards touches on and explains a range of subjects, which was very welcome to my beginner eyes. I can't comment on the accuracy of the brain-hemisphere stuff, but I DID learn some neat things about perception, negative space, lighting, and more - going along section by section, Dr. Edwards through her exercises and explanations attempts to help the reader discover and build the component skills of perception; the basic foundation of making great drawings. It's not so much a book on drawing techniques, but a book on teaching you the basics of how to see and think like an artist (whatever that means). So, at the end of it all, did my drawing get better because of this book? Well, I'm still a rank beginner but I was pretty surprised how much I improved over a short time period when comparing my initial drawings to the final exercises. Great success in my book! As I'm not familiar with the science I'm not sure how much of this bleeds into pseudoscience, and over the course of the book I did get a sense of patronizing/holier-than-thou attitude. Overall, though, it was an interesting and easy read with engaging exercises and, in my case, pretty effective outcomes. If you're a beginner like me looking for a place to start drawing in earnest, I'd definitely recommend this book. At the end of the day I've walked away with new perspectives, a basic tool set to draw on, and a new appreciation for the focus and labour that my creative friends put in to their works."
The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627206.The_New_Drawing_on_the_Right_Side_of_the_Brain/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I had mixed feelings about this book. The principles she focuses on are great and will help improve drawing skills. It's worth it for that if you are wanting some drawing instruction without paying for an expensive class. The materials you need to collect are going to be kind of expensive and, if not hard to find, will require you visit several different places around town to purchase them. The exercises are fine, they will definitely help you work on each of the principles, but she pretty quickly has you do exercises that require later skills to make them work well. So for example, shading and shadow is the very last skill she introduces, but it shows up in the very first skill's exercise. I think she could have separated out the skills a bit more distinctly. I also think part of the problem lies in her examples she shares. She's always showing master works or drawings she's done and it kind of seems like while she had a grasp on the different skills she doesn't always see how they are showing up working together in her examples. She also has you tone your paper in every damn exercise and frankly she should have made them work with plain white paper so you don't need the graphite stick and don't need to spend time shading and smudging your paper for 15 minutes before you even start. She also asks you to devote an hour or more to each exercise. Honestly, if I had that kind of time regularly I would take an in person class so I could get more direct instruction. I would have liked more shorter exercises to practice rather than one single long exercise. Finally, her brain science isn't particularly helpful especially since it's not totally accurate. She didn't actually have to use the left and right brain idea to explain that what she's really teaching you is to look at the world in a slightly different way so that you can reproduce what you're seeing on paper. She's also teaching you to get into a flow state so you can focus on your drawing and getting into that mode of seeing shapes, edges, shadows, and negative space without extraneous distractions. There's an abysmal chapter that she added at some point where she basically laments that we don't teach cursive in schools for long enough or require children to write in beautiful cursive and oh my god I almost threw the book in the trash for that chapter alone. I am so tired of teachers lamenting that nonsense as if it's so simple for all children to just write beautifully if only we forced them too and their brains won't develop properly if we don't force them to always write in beautiful cursive. Cursive sucks for a lot of kids and not everyone will have gorgeous penmanship. And no, not everyone had good handwriting even when people used to write letters all the time. Good lord it adds nothing to this book and nothing to help kids develop."

It literally changed my life and the way I think. Like many others, I thought 'being artistic' was a personality trait. Either you had it, or you didn't. 'Artistic' people could quickly draw some lines on a paper and make it into something beautiful. Or they could take a few objects and arrange them in a way that would make you say 'yes, this is really nice'. Or do a slew of other amazing things that I couldn't. Clearly I wasn't artsy and I understood that from early childhood and accepted it. The author noticed many people feel the same way and she was able to (accurately) trace it back to some time around the age of 10. Prior to that, everyone basically draws the same way: stick figures and circles etc. Everyone also loves art. But then, suddenly, some children are able to draw what their eyes see, and some aren't. That is, if asked to draw an apple, some 10-year-olds will draw a circle with a line sticking out, and others will draw a complex object that anyone would recognize as an apple. Those of us who weren't able to draw the complex object deemed ourselves to be un-artistic and draw a circle with a line in it, assuming that is as far as that skill will ever grow. Simply, this book gives you that missing art lesson you should have gotten right when you felt that way. How do you go from the circle with a line in it to an apple? As an analytical-minded person, what should you do? She teaches you that specific skill in a really straightforward way. Now, the part that changed my life: after this book, I started drawing and kept it up for several months. I drew some things that I was actually really proud of (still am). I didn't go on to become a professional artist or anything, but I understood that the art world isn't something inaccessible to me. It turns out you can have an analytical mind and use it art. You can learn art. You can improve on it. You can understand it. You can explore it. This book took art from ""something I can never do, and, at best, admire from afar"" to ""something I absolutely do, and something I can be really good at if I want to put in the practice"" 5 stars :)"

Edwards leads readers on a voyage of self-discovery and creative empowerment with rigorous attention to detail and a wealth of information. Edwards' investigation of the hemisphere functions of the brain and how they affect the creative process forms the core of this book. She explores the differences between the left and right hemispheres, highlighting the right hemisphere's special abilities in visual perception and creative expression. She assists artists in realising their full creative potential by drawing on these skills. Edwards exposes us to a variety of people that help to illustrate her lessons throughout the book. These figures, like the ""drawing brain"" and the ""perceptual switch,"" work as guidance for us as we pursue our artistic endeavours. They give a foundation for comprehending the transforming process of drawing on the right side of the brain and provide insights into the inner workings of our thoughts. Readers may advance at their own rate because to Edwards' thorough and well-structured pedagogical method. The activities and methods in this book can be used to improve one's spatial awareness, observational abilities, and capacity for new perspectives. She inspires readers to accept their creative inclinations by instilling confidence via engrossing tales and hands-on examples. There are a few disadvantages, though, that should be mentioned. The lengthy scientific explanations and theoretical debates could be too much for some readers to handle, especially if they are looking for a more practical approach that focuses only on technique. The book also predominantly emphasises realistic drawing, which could not entirely appeal to artists who prefer abstract or current techniques. The book ""The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" is an insightful manual for releasing one's creative potential. The knowledge of Betty Edwards, together with the inclusion of endearing people, gives the work depth and a sense of intimacy. This book offers as a source of motivation and empowerment for artists looking to explore new artistic boundaries and release their inner creativity despite its focus on theory and realistic drawing."

She writes that the left side of our brain handles language and logic, while the right side deals with creativity and emotionality. Drawing is a great way to tap into your creative side, so you can use your left hand for math and reading, and your right hand for art! Did you know that there are two hemispheres of your brain? You have a left hemisphere for language and logic, and a right hemisphere for creativity and emotionality. If you've ever wondered how to use this information to improve your drawing skills, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is the book for you. It explains in detail what goes on in each hemisphere of your brain when you draw—and then teaches you how to use that knowledge to draw better pictures! I'm always interested in new techniques and ways to improve my drawing skills. I recently read Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about drawing. The book is divided into 10 Chapters: how to draw, how to think like a painter, and how to work with your hands. The first part explains how the left hemisphere of your brain controls sight while the right hemisphere controls touch and movement. It then goes on to explain how this information can be used to draw better pictures. You will learn how to use your right hand instead of your left hand when drawing. You also learn about various tools that can help you get started drawing with your right hand (like a pencil). The book even includes a set of exercises where you can practice using your right hand as much as possible! I love this book because it teaches me how to draw on the right side of my brain. It's a great way to improve my drawing skills and I think everyone should read this book! Dil Nawaz, Founder of The Lion Studios info@thelionstudios.com +923472058390"

The benefits I was hoping to get from it were two-fold: learn how to draw, and understand better how to engage the 'artistic' side of the brain. Whenever I think that I have to draw something, I associate it with dread and negativity. I absolutely hated drawing and painting when I was in school, my last memories of actually enjoying sketching and drawing must have been before I was 6. Even at that time I was of the opinion that we weren't actually studying painting or art, we were just given an assignment and expect to perform, but there was no instruction on a how. As an adult, I can't draw at all, I sketch out stickmen and that's about it. While I would love to learn how to draw better though, I approached this book with wanting to understand the theory behind drawing, what to look for, how to think about composition and what I'm missing from the artistic process. The writer recommends doing all the exercises in the book - I didn't do that because it's not an essential skill for me, it is more something I would like to understand at this point of my life. I would just like to have some starting points when I draw. Betty Edwards structures her advice in sections on edges, shadows and light, spaces, relationships and colours. She puts an algorithm behind perceptions that drawings achieve, such as how to use negative space, how to pick colours, how to measure shape dimensions and how to achieve flow during this activity. So even if I did not do these exercises, I now know where to start and what I will have to do if I choose that I would like to draw. I absolutely would would say that I would have loved if art classes were approached in this way, understanding how to perceive what you are drawing and how to translate the subject to paper. Absolutely great reading for those of us who feel embarrassment whenever they need to draw something in order to express their ideas accurately."

But in Betty Edwards’ Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, it talks about how to think about art in a different way and using the more creative right of the brain rather than the linear left side. One literary device that the author uses is Imagery. This literary element is used throughout the book where she describes how to draw in a way that makes it easier to visualize how to draw. An example of this is with her instructions where she has detailed explanations of how to follow the steps correctly. She also uses illustrations to further support this which are also effective because they show the steps and examples of famous art pieces that also use those steps and techniques. This is effective because it better shows the reader how to get better at drawing. Another literary element used throughout the book is epigraph where there are many quotes from famous authors on drawing. There are many examples of this throughout the book with quotes from artists related to the chapter. This is effective because it relates art to a wider perspective in looking how it changes your perspective of the world. Another literary device is extended metaphor which is used throughout the book to relate drawing to other activities. An example of this is related drawing to driving, which requires constant focus and drawing also require constant focus. This is effective because it creates a good analogy to how drawing requires a lot of attention in order to be successful in. Overall Betty Edwards’ Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is a great book for anyone wanting to learn how to truly learn how to draw and how to improve your skills as well. It is also great how drawing and art as well can teach us how to look at the world differently for the future."

From beginners to experienced artists, this book revolutionizes the way we approach drawing and unleashes our creative abilities. Edwards ingeniously introduces the concept of ""drawing on the right side of the brain,"" emphasizing the importance of shifting from logical, analytical thinking to intuitive, perceptual thinking. Through a series of insightful exercises and thought-provoking anecdotes, she guides readers on a transformative journey that challenges preconceived notions about drawing. One of the book's greatest strengths lies in its ability to demystify the artistic process. Edwards skillfully breaks down complex techniques into simple, manageable steps, allowing even the most self-proclaimed ""non-artistic"" individuals to develop confidence and skill. With each exercise, she helps readers develop their observational skills, encouraging them to see the world in a new light. What sets this book apart is its incorporation of brain science and psychology. Edwards delves into the cognitive processes behind drawing, exploring the interconnectedness of perception, memory, and creativity. By understanding the brain's capacity for visual perception, readers are empowered to tap into their innate artistic abilities. ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" is not just a practical guide; it is a transformative experience. It teaches us that drawing is not reserved for the chosen few, but rather a universal language that allows us to express our unique perspectives. Whether you aspire to become an artist or simply want to explore your creative side, this book is a must-read. Prepare to be inspired, challenged, and amazed as Betty Edwards unlocks the artist within you."

To those with a deeper understanding of art, it probably won’t seem like a breakthrough book but for me, it was significant. My drawings prompted by the book, including my first-round drawings versus my final-round drawings, were (though still terrible) markedly improved. Some of the things I learned include how to view and use negative space (new concept for me), contours, and light vs shadows. The walkthrough of concepts followed by exercises were actually really fun, though required a good deal of time to set aside to practice. Overall, this book reiterates that drawing is an improvable skill, not wholly some intrinsic gift. As such, improving the skill requires regular practice. My one takeaway quote: “The arts are neglected because they are based on perception, and perception is disdained because it is not assumed to involve thought. In fact, educators and administrators cannot justify giving the arts an important position in the curriculum unless they understand that the arts are the most powerful means of strengthening the perceptual component without which productive thinking is impossible in every field of academic study. “What is most needed is not more aesthetics or more esoteric manuals of art education but a convincing case made for visual thinking quite in general. Once we understand in theory, we might try to heal in practice the unwholesome split which cripples the training of reasoning power.” -B. Edwards"

I read someplace there was a new edition available and I checked a copy out of our public library. Immediately I saw some of the same illustrations and was disappointed. Flipping to the reverse of the title page I saw it was published in 1999. It’s 2022 as I write this. Good drawing basics in 21st century U.S.A. don’t differ much from 50 years or so ago. Learning to draw from a book isn’t good though! One needs a teacher present to point out marks needing change and to verify you corrected the marks well etc. That’s why beginning drawing classes are in pencil and charcoal and students leave with grimy hands! Please don’t try learning to draw by using a book! Find a school or if there is none in your community, I can imagine you might find a tutor among folks in your community. Or go to any library where you may find with art books. Look at many, many of their art books with drawings included. Look at drawings that pull you in and study them, try to figure out where the artist began, try copying a few, look at drawings on Instagram or the free portion of YouTube & follow some artists you enjoy. Beware though that many “artists” sell classes on Instagram and YouTube. Many people on Instagram “ teaching art classes” did not attend art school. They took a few online classes. Clarify your expectations before paying for classes. Online drawing classes rarely give one individual feedback. That’s an essential part of learning to draw. If you want to play with some art materials I suggest “mixed media” online classes. There are countless options!"

Those skills are perceptual: perception of line, negative spaces, proportion, light and shadow, and the gestalt (drawing-as-a-whole). It is an excellent introduction for those (like me) who stopped trying to draw realistically as a child and never really learned to draw. It is NOT for anyone who can already draw realistically and is looking for a work on drawing technique. Kids from about age 10 can benefit from the exercises, although I think only readers from about age 15+ would have any interest in the theory (and maybe not even then). It's a great book, but a bit theory-heavy and not enough exercises. Yes, there are exercises for each of the skills, and several for each skill, but drawing is above all a practical skill, and it needs practice! This is especially true for me (I have ADHD and Asperger's, and I'm underdeveloped in hand-eye coordination and perceptual skills as a result). The companion book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain Workbook, has more than thirty exercises covering the whole gamut of skills and is an excellent companion to this, but it has none of the theory. Amazon has the pair of books available as a discounted bundle. I have found that this book has improved my drawing skills hugely. They have gone from abysmal to merely bad! And that's with maybe five total hours of practice. I confidently expect that with diligent practice of the skills taught in this book, they will improve to I'm-not-embarrassed-to-show-my-art levels. Strongly recommended."

I graduated with my B.A. in Drawing & Painting and my Teaching Certificate in 2009, and ever since then this book has been recommended to me by different people at different times through out my teaching career. Over the last few years, I even obtained *tw0* copies of the book, which I placed on my bookshelves (one at home, one at school). I had a genuine interest in the book, and every intention of reading it, but as I much prefer reading for pleasure (novels, memoires, etc.) over information, I just never got around to it. The class I took had me read this book cover to cover, and complete many of the drawing exercises inside. It also came with a series of video sequences hosted by Betty Edwards. Having just completed the course last week, I'm currently at an MA +39 credits and this course was the *MOST* helpful, useful and informative I've taken to date. Even though we've got three months of school left, I'm eager to begin utilizing Edwards' exercises in my intro-to-art classes next year. Edwards does a fantastic job of taking very complicated ideas (basically how your brain works) and breaks it down into digestible information that really makes sense. Her exercises are quick and meaningful, and if utilized correctly can help anyone - whether you've never picked up a pencil in your life, or if you've got your Masters in art - become a better artists. I fully recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning how to draw, or wants to improve their teaching practice."

It took me, literally, from stick figures to realism in seven weeks! I couldn't believe it. But the technique is actually simple, and the new steps added each week filled in the entire picture. I can only super highly recommend this book! It is easier to take a class with a knowledgeable teacher, because in the beginning, those who don't know how to draw will be a bit intimidated. I taught this class for over 30 years in various cities around the country. I mostly taught in community colleges and Parks and Recreation and it was always the most popular class. The reason it was so popular, is that all I said in the beginning was: ""Follow the instructions and do the homework, and you will be drawing realistically by the end of this class."" And they did! I have numerous ""before and after"" drawings, and many letters from those who took the class. I have since retired, however, I can highly recommend this book!

The intimate experience of the artist -he who draws- and his point of view, it's still a fertile subject, that could help a lot of people as a therapy, and just because it is FUN. The lateralization and asymmetry of our brain was a popular theme for the pop culture a couple decades ago, hence, the aversion academics felt for tackling it for a while –but since I've been getting in contact with the serious work of guys like Mcgilchrist, I've thinking that it's due time to renovate out relationship with the good intentions behind books like this one of Betty Edwards. Edwards' work encapsulates a lot of potential for self-transformation (through sensibility and even flow) to anybody who has in check his or her arrogance. Hybris is a POISON for souls in general, but since I myself am artist and I've seen my struggle and the struggle of others from VERY close, I would say that [pride] it is, even more, for those who dare to transit the beautiful path towards drawing and art. Perfection is the enemy of the good. And what's good seems to me as the only way to excellence. I see Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, as an antidote to that kind of soberbia that makes people blind to the beauty of our world. It rehabilitates the atrophy of the ""artistic muscle"" we all used to had and that most of us stop developing at 11 years old."

She's always talking about looking out at the sun-dappled mesas of New Mexico, or using some other affected, high-falutin' lingo about her gloriously new age, trendy life. Meanwhile, I look out at the cracked concrete of my driveway in the Chicago drizzle and wonder how us normal people ever survived without people like Julia Cameron telling us about their fantastically charmed lives. However, I like the little mind toys in this book. I did the morning pages, and found them interesting. I strolled the aisles of dollar stores and played a bit because of her book, and it was fun. So, she gets two stars. If she were less Baby-Boomer Annoying, she would have gotten more."

That is something I fundamentally disagree with. You should not skip your child's soccer game to paint your masterpiece. Your kid is the masterpiece. All of the relationships in your life are masterpieces. I use that as an example but there are other moments in this book where self-indulgence at the expense of others is encouraged. This is loathsome. So why didn't I just give the book and the program a 1-star rating? Because there are some very good ideas in there. Namely the morning pages. They grow tedious for me but I do find them effective. Also, I highly recommend taking an hour or two out of your week to have an adventure in the world by yourself. This really is a great way to stimulate your creativity, no matter what your craft is. Overall, if you want to try this program, go for it and recognize which parts do and don't work for you. However, I must warn that there is an ugly side to what Julia Cameron preaches here and I won't endorse that."

At the time I first read it fifteen years ago, it did wonders to open me up creatively. I was still struggling to slough off some negative parental programming about being a writer, and this book (along with a good friend) helped give me permission to explore that side of myself. Since that time, however, my belief system has changed so radically that I no longer agree with a number of the book’s fundamental premises. For this reason, it would be hard for me to recommend it now. I do think it contains some good material in the form of useful exercises and uplifting stories about creative development. But those come with heavy doses of New Age spirituality and recovery beliefs that will likely make the book inaccessible to anyone who doesn’t view the world through that filter."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I can't rate this book, since my opinion of it veers wildly between five stars and zero stars. (ETA: two stars is maybe a fair compromise?) For those not familiar with it, The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a book that claims it can reconnect anyone with their ""Inner Artist,"" via a program modeled openly on AA's Twelve Step Program (it is not a coincidence that Cameron is a recovering alcoholic). As such, it conceptualizes creativity as something inherently spiritual and conceptualizes the artist as a channel for God's will. So. PROBLEM NUMBER ONE: For me, creativity is not something that comes from outside the self, but something that comes from deep the self. (And Cameron isn't actually very consistent, since her model of creativity seems to be something like the Puritans' model of the Elect: it's entirely out of your control, but you have to behave properly in order to be one. So her model goes back and forth between ""you have to open yourself to God's will"" and ""you have to find the ideas that are deep within you and nurture them into bloom."") Also, I admit this freely, I have all the spirituality of a brick, so treating creativity as something spiritual means it's something I'm excluded from, and I think I can be forgiven for not liking that model very much. PROBLEM NUMBER TWO: Cameron has (I hope unconsciously) reinvented one of Freud's more repellent ideas. Where, in talking about Dora, he postulates that ""yes"" means yes, and ""no"" means yes, Cameron explains that if you don't like any of her teachings, or if they make you angry, that just means you're childishly resisting the thing you need in order to heal. So, basically, if you question or argue with her, that's a sign you're Doing It Wrong. This idea annoys me more than a little. PROBLEM NUMBER THREE: Cameron is writing from a position of unconscious privilege. She has the freedom to assume that if you are blocked creatively, it is something you can solve by willpower alone, that it's more or less something you have unconsciously done to yourself because you are scared of being creative. She does not allow for health (either physical or mental) to be something that may be affecting your creativity, and although she acknowledges that there are people who are creative but who cannot create because they are too busy struggling to survive or to care for their children or whatever other actual and genuine impediment may be in their life that they cannot simply will away by rearranging their schedule a little, she has a serene confidence that none of are reading her book. As someone who has been unable to write, to a greater or lesser degree, for seven years (yes, you did read that correctly; I finished the principal draft of in 2009), I would like to state for the record that if the problem could be solved by willpower alone, And I resent the condescending attitude that the problem is all my fault, if I would just have enough self-insight to see it. PROBLEM NUMBER FOUR: Cameron is of the same school of thought as and , that writing (and other forms of creativity) is basically therapy, that creativity comes from the well of psychic injury. Now, writing be theraputic, and tremendously so, but this model of writing-as-therapy, as direct one-to-one correspondence stream-of-consciousness therapy, does not work for me and never has. PROBLEM NUMBER FIVE: Cameron believes ""The universe will always support affirmative action"" (194), that if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe will send you what you need. Always. Now maybe it's just because I've read too much true crime and it's made me cynical, but I can't help pointing out that sometimes, if you open yourself up to the universe, the universe sends you . The universe is inherently benevolent. It is inherently indifferent and does not give a fuck whether you succeed or fail. Some of these problems are merely annoying; some of them are potentially destructive to writers (and other artists) if they take them as gospel (pardon the pun); some of them are irresponsible and dangerous. But despite all that, and despite the fact that I did not so much the Artist's Way as it, there are a lot of valuable ideas in what Cameron says. Some of them were things I already knew, but needed to be reminded of, like that, just like any other form of creativity, writing requires continual practice. Even if you can't write a story, you can still write , and you need to. ""Sloth, apathy, and despair are the enemy,"" she says on page 62, and I agree with that whole-heartedly. And I love her idea of true north, that two people can have the same goal, but their , the thing pulling them like a lodestone, don't have to be the same. And I would follow that with, if you lose your true north, for whatever reason, you're going to have to find it again before you can get very far. She harmonizes with Csikszentmihalyi in emphasizing that the writer is well-served to value process over product, and she points out something I have, in fact, taken to heart; that when your ""sensible"" self asks, ""Do you know how long it's going to take you to do X? Do you know how old you'll be?"" the correct answer is, ""Just as old as I'll be if I don't do it."" Cameron also provides a lot of quotes from a lot of people, some of which I found wrong, some inane, some simply not applicable. But some I really liked, like 's """" (Which, okay, I'm not going to say ""The Waking"" is the greatest villanelle of all time, but I am gonna say it's pretty damn close.) Others: ""I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues."" --Duke Ellington ""Whenever I have to choose between two evils, I always like to try the one I haven't tried before."" --Mae West ""It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult."" --Seneca ""In a dark time, the eye begins to see."" --Roethke again. ""Look and you will find it--what is unsought will go undetected."" --Sophocles ""Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little. The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark."" --Agnes de Mille ""Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life."" --Linus Pauling ""The unconscious wants truth. It ceases to speak to those who want something else more than truth."" --Adrienne Rich ""The job of the artist is always to deepen the mystery."" --Francis Bacon (, not ) ""What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is still not enough."" --Eugène Delacroix (forgive him his sexism, he's been dead for a hundred and fifty-four years) ""Adventure doesn't begin until you get into the forest."" --Mickey Hart ""One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."" --André Gide ""A painting is never finished--it simply stops in interesting places."" --Paul Gardner"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"http://mrlshelflife.wordpress.com/201... The Artist’s Way, while it contains some gems, is an overall disappointment. I’ve started it several times and it took me this fourth time to get all the way through. I had previously blamed my inability to finish it more on myself than on the work in general. The book taken as a whole comes across as pop psychology mixed with a heavy dose of New Age philosophy. There is a lot of talk about nurturing the inner child that is our real artist, the child’s inability to accept raw criticism and how this creates emotional scar tissue. The inner artist child needs to be protected and nurtured and needs to have its hand held and be tenderly led through the miasma of the psyche of the growing artist. She even goes so far as to equate poorly delivered criticism to sexual abuse, and projects that don’t materialize to miscarriages from which the artist suffers as much as the woman who lost a child. That was where she lost me for good. The book is full of case examples; artists, novelists, poets, script writers, all of who benefited from Cameron’s twelve week recovery. (Should I understand this as Cameron, a recovering alcoholic, devising her own twelve step program?) All of these case characters are given to us on a first name basis. One example is Ted, a blocked novelist who after the program and twelve (that number again) years of working with the Morning Pages, now has three novels to his credit. Okay. Ted, who? I want to see his work. I also want to see Bob’s breakout documentary, the one that a teacher trashed so harshly that Bob hid the reels in his basement which was then flooded. Then, after opening up to Cameron about the lost project, copies of the reels are found and he uses he newfound creativity, found with Cameron’s help, to finish the documentary and do yet another. I want to see these works. I want to connect to the tangible success of people who have travel this path that Cameron is leading us on. But alas Ted and Bob are just two examples of the long list of one-name shadows walking through Cameron’s book. The works these people completed and published could be a source of inspiration but are denied us by this one-name, AA-style, anonymity. After a while I began to question how many of these people were real. The one example she gave that I found truly inspirational worked for me because she used the full name, a name I recognized (Blake Edwards), and a story about him that is well known. It was one I’d heard before and I was glad to be reminded of it. It is a loss to Cameron’s work that there aren’t more examples that the reader can actually wrap his/her hands around. Cameron also talks long and hardy about her own work, much of which is in the film industry. I checked on IMDB. The list is short, two of the citations are for “Special Thanks” on major works by other people. She talks about writing plays. I can’t find any. She apparently worked as a journalist but a quick (and far from thorough) internet search didn’t turn up any leads. I remember seeing one novel by her in the library. Google her name and the overwhelming return is for The Artist’s Way. This is not to minimize Cameron’s achievements but it would help if she threw up some street signs leading the way to tangible evidence of her own work that shows us her program works. Her idea for Morning Pages does have an application. It is an effective brain dump. It does clear the pipes, so to speak, but I don’t see the efficacy of a slave-like devotion to the practice. I used it long before I found The Artist’s Way. I called it “writing in my journal.” I use it when my head is cluttered with too much information, which often happens during my job running two departments in a busy hotel, and trying to maintain even the barest minimum of creative pursuits. I can’t see myself, however, locked into every morning spending up to an hour doing Morning Pages. I can put that valuable time to better use writing my novels, stories, poetry and blog posts. I will admit I did exactly what she said not to do; I read the book through instead of doing the weekly exercises. In fact the last few chapters were scanned rather than thoroughly read. I realized early on that my “blockage” wasn’t about my creativity. My creativity is fine. I have lots of ideas and when I sit my butt down and work I can actually write and what I write is usually pretty good. My blockage is my discipline, my self-sabotage, and my lack of confidence and I didn’t find Cameron’s prescription to be a healing balm for my symptoms. I started looking at what some of my favorite and most respected writers have to say about writing, unblocking, and producing work. They don’t talk about twelve step recovery and nurturing our inner child who never grows up. They talk about work. Getting pen in hand, or hands on the keyboard and working. They talk about working until it works. They talk about breaking through blockages with action, not weekly exercises and group therapy sessions. These people talk about writing as people of other professions talk about their careers. They talk about how it takes work, discipline and action, and confidence in your ability. They talk about being able to recognize good criticism vs. poor criticism, and being mature enough to deal with both at face value. They talk about the reality of rejection and putting it in its proper place and not letting it sideswipe your momentum. This is the approach that I believe will work best for me and my writing. © 2014 M. Romeo LaFlamme"

If I hadn't signed up for that class, I'm sure I would have never picked up this book. I expected The Artist's Way to be full of fluffy, New-Agey platitudes, and I approached it with cynicism and skepticism. However, I kept an open mind. I read each chapter thoroughly. I did the morning pages every day and an artist's date once a week. I did a handful of the exercises at the end of each chapter. And my life changed. The morning pages resulted in an award-winning nonfiction book, a series of children's picture book manuscripts, and the willingness to embark upon another, more challenging nonfiction book writing project. The artist's dates renewed my childlike love for the fiber arts, and I began creating beautiful handwork projects. I learned to surf. I joined a writing group. Most importantly, even more important than the concrete examples of creativity that have resulted, I was given a set of tools for life - tools that enable me to challenge that critical voice in my head, and to trust my instincts. I can't say enough about this book. It came into my life during a difficult time, and it has dovetailed beautifully with recovery in other areas in my life."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"In essence, The Artist’s Way is a pop-psychology self-help book for blocked artists. And, like any other pop-psych self-help book, you get a little bit of preaching, a few tips and tricks and a bunch of homework. It’s not specific to any art form or technique—you could even argue that it’s not even about art. is a book about creativity in the broadest sense: it applies equally to writing, dressmaking, acrobatics, entrepreneurship, or anything that involves doing or making something new. What Julia Cameron offers in her book is a method to overcome crippling self-doubt, self-sabotage, and apathy. There are quite a few weaknesses in this book, however. First, the sermonizing part is quite literally an indoctrination attempt about God as the Creator and how God is creative, and why we should be so as well, and then God would help us be creative just as he is because God created man in his own image and if we don’t believe in his creative power, we are resisting our God-given talent and so on and so forth. Ditto regarding the who needs to be mollycoddled and pampered and healed and yadda yadda. Much of it, however, is an interesting slice of outdated hippie, neo-puritan psychobabble. Furthermore, Julia Cameron never tires of providing anecdotes about herself, her friends, her acquaintances, and her customers who, being stuck in a sterile rut for too long, have become almost like Balzac or Beethoven just by following her incredible “creative recovery” method. Unfortunately, the name-dropping is always relatively unspecific, and we never get to know who these outstanding creative persons were, so we must take Cameron’s word for it. As for the homework, that is probably the most valuable (although not ground-breaking) part of this book. It is broken down into a 12-week course, almost like an AA support group. The two essential building blocks of Julia Cameron’s set of exercises are straightforward: 1) The “morning pages” are meant to get us into the habit of writing a journal, which, in and of itself, is undoubtedly a beneficial practice: uncritically expressing and recording our thoughts and ideas on paper and getting our creative juices flowing—this is just a first step of course; writing is a whole different ballgame. 2) The “artist’s dates” are invitations to regularly take some alone time to take care of ourselves and do something we enjoy. Again, a healthy habit: taking care of the goose that lays the golden eggs… The book includes many more exercises that the reader can choose to do or skip. Overall, Julia Cameron’s programme is an encouragement to get one’s creative mojo back into gear. The most significant aspect of her method is probably honing one’s self-awareness, making things fun and enjoyable, letting go of fear and control, showing up and trusting the process. Easier said than done, but that’s indeed a fundamental part of the job."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I recently completed the 12-week book on my own, and I think that it was very well put together. I was already on my way to discovering a few of the main drivers in the book, but it would have taken me many years to collect them. I have been inspired by this book, and it has helped me work through things, instead of ignoring big problems with my creative process and trying to push them aside. A few of the reviews haven't been so kind for this book, which is okay. It is really hard to surrender to anything - it's hard to let go and give in to something. And I don't mean God or Christianity (which is the author's personal belief system which also influences a lot of the book) necessarily - I mean a process - put in place to help. It's hard to just do it, and be open to what this book can do and what can happen. That being said, I didn't agree with everything written in the book. It's not like it's The Creative Process Bible or anything (so don't feel like it's that way or the highway or anything). Sure, for a couple of the exercises I just wrote ""eh, that's okay"" instead of doing them, and many of the exercise questions were obviously trying to lead you in one direction. But I think that's hardly a reason to throw this book to the birds. First, if you're considering doing this but aren't sure, read ""The Artist's Way Questions and Answers"" in the back of the book (page 205 in the 10th Anniversary Edition that I had), and you'll get a really good idea of what you'll be doing every day, every week, and Julia Cameron's philosophical approach to her book. And finally, if you decide to do it, do it all. If you're like me, you barely finish anything and it takes a hell of a lot of energy to complete something - and sheesh a 12 week long thing? But, at least for me, the 12 weeks went by in a flash and I really looked forward to the readings and exercises, and was so enthusiastic with the kind of creativity this book helped me to find and produce. Enjoy it. When it gets frustrating and you don't have the time, deal with it. Skip a day. Come back and do a morning page and you'll inevitably write until you get to the bottom of why you are frustrated and skipped a day. It's a process, and it doesn't have to be perfect. Have FUN!"

[I had shared about the great fun I had once in a weekly three-month art therapy group].... “The Artist’s Way”, celebrates its 25th anniversary.... It’s a very popular book — 3,068 people reviewed it on Amazon. 85% - 5 star reviews! So.... many people got great value. However, this book wasn’t for me. I didn’t resonate with the religious aspects - nor am I an alcoholic - nor am I looking for a 12-week exercise program to reclaim my creativity - or change my life. I’m ok with not unblocking my hidden talents..... I’m not a “recovering” artist, and I didn’t care for the many assumptions to its reference. The writing was too flowery - - life is beautiful- for my taste. I’m okay being a sour-pussy uncreative average-Josie."

However, as a working artist, I appreciated this book and found value in her ideas. If you're at the beginning of your creative career, these ideas can give you support and encouragement to do the work and move past obstacles and negative attitudes, especially those expressed by others. **************************** 2019 re-read: Made it through the intro material and now working the activities for Week One. This is a pretty serious self-analysis/self-help program. I can see why people would do this as a course or with a group. Anyway, I started the daily pages and I'm contemplating what to do for my first Artist Date. ******* Finishing up the second week ""Recovering a Sense of Identity"" I have to say, I'm feeling positive results and I'm surprised at how well the morning pages are working... ********************* Some pretty deep moments working with this book and the daily pages writing. I'll be revisiting part of this during the coming year."

All 12 weeks of it. Well, 13 if you count that week I got pissed off and nearly quit. There's a week in there where she requires you to not read at all. No books, newspapers, comics. Back when this was published (1992) there wasn't the issue of mindless social media scrolling. So it was the issue of reading back then. Mindless reading. But I don't do a hell of a lot of social media, and the plasticity of actors in movies and TV gives me the willies so I don't watch much, so it wasn't a problem to hold off on those. But I do read. That was tough and I rebelled. Rebelled against an author in her old age a million miles away telling me what to do. Which was the point she was getting at. We've become blocked creatively because of our habits and we react like a hurt dog when there's the threat of change. Being personally well-steeped in recovery culture this book belongs near the 12 Step books and not the crafts section. She acknowledges her debt to the recovery manuals, and indeed, if one were so hardlined about it, one could claim she was reappropiating much of the teachings in Alcoholics Anonymous. But it's of no great importance. It's about finding a way back to that childlike sense of play. Taking back our sense of wonder that this goddamned digital age has leached from us. There are two main actions in this book. 1. Do your morning pages. 3 pages of verbal diarrhea, the contents of which doesn't matter, simply being at the page is what is important. She's teaching you how to ""rest on the page."" 2. Go on a weekly artist date. This I didn't really do because I felt foolish. She wanted you to go buy gold stars and penny candy to treat your inner child. So there's that. Being so familiar with the weird requests of therapists and sponsors, I felt no real enmity with anything in this book. And I came away from it with a habit now 90 days old, the habit of showing up every day at the page come hell or high water. I recommend this for the undisciplined among us, like myself, who've tried and tried to unbury the artist within, the one that became covered up and discarded as the years piled on, as responsibilities bloomed and laughter waned and adulthood came in front and center. Do they even make penny candy anymore?"

I've been doing it for ten years now, and I have learned many little tricks along the way. I'm going to employ one of them now to let you know if you're going to enjoy this book or not. Ready? The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity ...See what I did there? Mm-hmm. That's why they pay me the big bucks. I really wanted to like this book. Not only that, I really wanted to from it. I'm in the midst of trying to write a novel (I know, kill me), and I have several friends who spoke of it with great enthusiasm, so I went in with high expectations that it would help me become more regular and fearless while trying to write. I've struggled with perfectionism in writing far more so than I struggle with it in the graphic arts, which was surprising and dismaying. I was expecting creative exercises, suggestions, anecdotes, and perspectives on harnessing daily creativity; I was bummed to find pop-psychology, self-help platitudes, abstract hippie-dippie aphorisms, and impenetrably meaningless one-liners that read like stoner wisdom. That is an actual quote from the book. I read it with my eyeballs, which sent the words up to my brain, and my brain was like ""hold up...u sure?"" and eyeballs were like ""ya i'm sure :\ idk"" and brain was like ""ok i;ll tell her but shes gonna be pissed."" AND MY BODY PARTS WERE RIGHT, they know me very well. I think there are fantastic kernels of truth in here, and several practical exercises that could really be beneficial to a struggling artist, depending on their own self and their own process. But each of those kernels is shellacked with a thick coating of grandiose new-agey mumbo jumbo that I found nearly impenetrable. There's a line from my favorite superhero movie, , where a young woman has been imprisoned and tortured. She believes she is about to die, and it's a death she has chosen to protect principals and ethics she didn't realize she had until she'd been pushed to her absolute limits. When she finds herself suddenly and unexpectedly freed, and standing in a rainstorm overlooking London, she lifts her arms and says: ""God is in the rain."" It's a line that would read incredibly hokey if you hadn't just earned it enduring real spiritual anguish through her. Every-other sentence in is ""God is in the rain."" Each of them is clearly meant with great sincerity and conviction, but the effect (for me) was narmy almost beyond tolerating. There is a lot--a LOT--of talk that feels like it's straight out of . Cameron insists that God will provide for you. At one point she even says ""leap, and a net will appear."" I really think this kind of advice can be damaging. There are lots of people who've leapt and met only jagged rocks, and it can't be framed as their failure because they didn't believe hard enough or trust deeply enough or wait long enough. There are tons of practical considerations that she dismisses as mere negativity that factor into career artistic success. For every J. K. Rowling who used art as a trampoline to success and fulfillment, there are tons of broke, out-of-work, exhausted working artists who find themselves wishing they'd chosen painting/sculpting/acting/poetry/playwriting/photography as their hobby rather than their profession. I'd even go so far as to say this kind of irresponsible ""God will provide your materials!"" crap is the kind of crap that got a lot of starry-eyed millennials $180,000 in dream-following debt. YOU ARE NOT A SELL-OUT OR A FAILURE OR A SAD HEAP OF WASTED POTENTIAL JUST BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO TAKE CRAZY RISKS. I repeat, there are good ideas in here. The quasi-spiritual mumbo jumbo just made it a lot harder for me to keep an open mind. Coupled with her frequent too-broad statements (""all creatives,"" ""all artists,"" ""all art""), I felt myself irrevocably turned off by the end of the first chapter. My philosophy at this point is shaped by my own experience, and I'm very wary of one-size-fits-all solutions to blocked creativity. Cameron insisted at many points that I'd been scolded for my artistry at a young age by unsupportive parents, and that I turned to alcohol and drugs to mute my inner anguish, and that my lack of freewriting pages was an expression of self-sabotage rather than conscious choice, that I was jealous of more successful artists, and lots of other bold blanket assessments that just felt incorrect and somewhat insulting. What I have learned, through much toil, is that I can't write a scene until I know what my goals for that scene are. ""In this chapter, I need Character A to start to change her mind about Character D; I need to foreshadow this future event; I need to make sure Character B and Character C end on bad terms; I need lighthearted dialogue because shit's getting heavy in the next chapter; and I need them to move from Point A to Point B, getting waylaid in such a way that the journey takes two and a half days."" It sounds a little exhaustive, but I learned that it's exactly the way I design: before I start sketching anything, I have to know what the goal for the design is. ""Who is the audience? Who are the competitors? What did you do last year? What about your past campaigns have worked/not worked? Who are the stakeholders?"" Once I know those things, I do it once, and it's damn-near perfect. I hate wasting energy and duplicating efforts playing guessing games. Once I have that list of goals, I will sit down and do the whole thing in one sitting, changing very little, because I'm writing the scene the best way I can the first time. Not only do I not enjoy the process of ""free writing"" or ""just writing,"" it makes me spitting mad when anyone tries to drag me into it. I think those techniques work for a lot of people. But the reality is that I thought I was making less progress than I truly was because writing self-help books/articles like these told me I was failing as long as I wasn't writing every day. ""Just write garbage, it doesn't matter"" I have been urged so, so, so many times. I was driving myself further away from my creative goals by giving too much credence to the chosen methodology of self-appointed gurus. What works for me may look like non-progress, and that is okay. I thought it was interesting that by the end of the book, Cameron brought up the fact that art can (and ideally should) be done for its own sake, without an eye on a final product. I actually think here is where a psychological angle could've been extraordinarily useful. There is some art that I make for other people, and there is some art that I make for myself, or for itself, and differentiating those goals seemed like a really crucial component to skim over. The best advice that Cameron had was embracing selfishness by defending your free time and creative energy. It's impossible for me to do, because ultimately I love my chosen family and I will always put my stuff on hold to make wedding invitations and resumes and portfolios and business cards and websites and videos and paintings and crafts. That is just who I am, I am...like, 85% at-peace with that. I also ""mm-hmmed"" along with her description of the people in your life who are jealous creative saboteurs; I've got one of those, that is a real thing, don't you ever fucking breathe a word to them about your creative dreams. Don't you ever let anyone keep you around as a yardstick by which to measure their own success--they will attack you and your work the moment you grow too tall for their egos to tolerate. I ultimately am glad I read it, more because it challenged me to think about my own creative process as I found myself disagreeing with her. And although ""morning pages,"" the bedrock of her program, are not for me, there were a handful of interesting thought exercises that I did find intriguing. If introspective isn't something that comes easily and comfortably to you, this book might be a good stepping stone. I'd also recommend it if, in general, you respond to inspiring self-help messaging. But if you're looking for practical advice on writing better, or drawing better, or managing time better, I think there are much more valuable books out there. ( is my baby bible.) If you're already pretty introspective, like me, and you are sensitive to condescension, like me, I wouldn't suggest it. And if fuzzy statements like ""God is in the rain"" make your eyes roll: avoid, avoid, avoid."

I had been able to suspend my disbelief about the god thing until then, but in that chapter Julia Cameron asks you to believe that God wants you to be rich, which I'm not sure I would believe even if I did believe in a god. Generally, all the synchronicity and serendipity and whatnot was just too much. Having said that, the exercises are pretty valuable. I plan to skim the book and flag useful-looking exercises to complete on my timeline -- not Cameron's!"

But, of course, I never did it. So I thought I would listen to the book and refresh my memory, and again I feel it would do me good. But will I do it this time? I have many other artists friends who have read it and also planned on doing it, but I don't know if they have either... The Artist Way is a book written to unblock artist of a kinds, writers, painters, actors ect. I can't say that I'm blocked, but it is hard to carve out time and feel creative in this crazy world we live in today. It is even harder to work on something of your own when you are actually working in the art field daily. The last thing you want to do when you get home from work is more work. The book is full of exercises to get you on that creative path, week by week, 12 in all (I think). The main exercise, one you do the whole time, is the one that is holding me back from starting. It's called Morning Pages. This exercise is doing a stream of consciousness journal first thing in the morning every morning. I am not a morning person, and I don't know many artists that are so writing anything, even spewing crazy off the wall and top of your head stuff is asking a lot. I don't think I could hold a pen at that moment, let alone actually write with it. Before coffee? I do recommend this book to all my creative friends reading this. As I said, I can see how it would work.....if you did it. You can't win, if you don't play."

I was living in Reno and then in Charlotte, NC when the book's popularity hit its zenith and there were Artist Way groups that got together at bookstores, libraries, community centers, and coffee shops. The biggest takeaway for me was morning pages--writing, by longhand, three pages of stream of consciousness stuff going on in your head to get it out of the way. Cleanse your pallet. It also made me aware of crazy makers in my life, which, at the time, I wasn't ready to let go of. But I think this book was part of a movement in my life that changed me in ways that eventually let me let go of people who subtly and not so subtly sabotaged my life. I've yet to meet a person who claims to have completed every exercise in the book, but I have met many people who have benefited either personally or artistically from having read it. Read it and then re-read parts of it and work the exercises."

(that makes it sound like i have students hanging around me and in my life at all times instead of twice a year.) but here it is, a teaser for this fine book: 1. first thing in the a.m.--before you even get out of bed--grab your handy notebook and pen and write three pages WITHOUT STOPPING OR THINKING. you are not doing writing writing. you are not to read it back (well months from now, ok.) just get it out and forget it. you might come up with a new screenplay idea. you might trash your cousin indigo because she ruined your marriage or spileld that starbucks on your dress. whatever.

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'd like to begin this review by acknowledging the fact that this book seems to have helped a lot of people connect to their creative selves, and for that reason I am glad of its existence. My experience with this book was multifaceted, but ultimately very unpleasant. I did take the program very seriously: up until Week 9 I completed the exercises and morning pages as prescribed (although it took me a year-and-a-half to do so). I've read on here many people describing this book as pseudo-psychological, self-centered, spiritual bullshit. Let me just say that I can definitely see why these claims were made. Cameron is very prescriptive and preachy, writing often in the collective ""we."" For example, from page 165 in Week 10, ""Blocked, we know who and what we are: unhappy people. Unblocked, we may be something much more threatening--happy."" Don't even get me started on the atrocious black-and-white sentiment here. What bothers me so much about this approach is her assumption that everyone is simply on the same page as her, with the same privileges, experiences, and emotional backgrounds. I don't care that it was written in the early '90s; not once does she mention how class, race, or even gender may affect one's access to creative modes and spaces. To Cameron, the only things standing in the way of reaching your True Creative Self are your friends and family members--at one point she urges you to label them as ""Wet Blankets""--and your lack of faith in god. For someone whose creative ""success"" seems to be almost exclusively tied to The Artist's Way franchise, she has an awful lot of rules and self-assurance that her ideas about creative living are inarguably True. It's been said that she modeled this program after the AA 12-step program. I do not deny that 12-step programs are effective and life-saving for many people--just that they're not for everyone. Cameron's adaptation of 12-step philosophies to creativity is a little extreme, in my opinion. She treats creative expression as a life-or-death matter, and unfortunately I internalized her opinions as facts for some time. And again, she never mentions structural issues like systemic racism, capitalism, or differing values that may impede one's ability to be a flourishing creative angel. The morning pages were helpful for me for awhile until I realized I began to ruminate more than I was clearing my head. I do love the idea of the ""artist's dates,"" though, and will definitely try to incorporate these into my life more frequently. In short, I do not recommend this book. If you are interested, I suggest reading it with a healthy dose of skepticism. Don't let her bully you into believing your life isn't full and beautiful unless you're creating masterpieces on the daily."

While there are some really magical sentences in here, it just isn't worth the slog. This book was written for a very specific person: someone who has spent their life in a corporate atmosphere, who has a lot of extra cash, and thinks they maybe want to try being creative. I was willing to look over this, but other things kept getting in my way from taking anything the author wrote to heart: • Name dropping. So much name dropping. I honestly do not care. This is not why I am reading the book. • She suggests you buy your way to creativity. In the sense of: go on vacation! buy some watercolors! take a day off! There is so much privilege assumed by this author that it is unnerving. • Advice that contradicts itself. This doesn't really happen until week 10, but still. Annoying. • The thought that if you don't like or spark with any of the tasks she demands, then that means you just aren't pushing through and/or doing it right. Nah, eff that. Different people learn different ways. • That everyone wants to be creative in order to make money from their art. What about the folks who just want to play an instrument as a hobby for themselves or paint on the weekends as an excuse to get out in nature? Not everything has to be commodified. In the end, I'm glad I read this book so that no one can ever recommend it to me again. I am sure that this content was very helpful to many people and kudos to you. For me, the values seem a bit dated and it just makes me angry and tired."

I figured, why not. As an aspiring writer, the book, definatly had some appeal, but kind of lost me as I progressed through it. It's obviously written for people who are not 'artists' per say, but would like to be. The first chapter was about overcoming mental obstacles (like being afriad that you'll become poor and get AIDS from being an artist...). It's also a very kind of spiritual 'new age' type of books, i.e. Art is from God and it flows through you, you are a beautiful vessel, etc... Regardless, each chapter gives you different exercises to do for the week, to become more creative and open yourslef up, some are good, and some are kind of ridiclous. The hardest thing the book challenges you to do is write at least 3 pages a day, free writing, by hand, right after you wake up. Which was suprisingly hard. I struggled for the first month, but after that I enjoyed actually writing every day. I don't actually do the morning pages anymore, but would start them up again later. It wasn't a complete wash, but the book wasn't really written for people who studied creative writing in college."

I think I've made some choices in my life that, in hindsight, I might not have made had I not had experience with this book. I think that's what is great about this book. Whether you make it through every chapter or not, there is something meaningful to take away from the writing prompts, ""morning pages,"" and playful, creative exercises ... and to this day, I have a much better outlook in general when I make a point of taking myself on an ""artist's date."" (To those who are in the middle of working through the book on their own or with a group ...

However, once you go past the useful ideas of morning pages and artist dates, you just end up with a white privileged woman’s interpretation of monotheistic religion in a Judaeo-Christian vein with a thin veneer of 90s New Age and pop-psychology. Even though she insists the book can be used by atheists as successfully (as long as they accept the existence of higher power which lol) I honestly don’t see how. The whole thing is modelled after the 12 step program which is problematic in itself but that’s a story for another time. This was not for me because it felt like more than half the book talked about getting rid of the doubters and toxic people in your life. I genuinely don’t have such people in my life. All my friends and family are extremely supportive and believe in me more than I believe in myself and push me to put myself out there. I am my own worst enemy and Cameron gets to that (around chapter 8 I believe) but by that point I’d read a chapter about how you won’t be a starving artist because god will give you money as god loves artists and also likes to reward people with money, so I’m pretty much done with this book at that point. There is also a ton of bullshit about how universe will provide if you just want something and show up. This is all in vein of The Alchemist and The Secret and all other absurd nonsense, including Jung’s synchronicity. In general this was so violently at odds with my whole worldview it was difficult to weed out the useful tidbits from it. But I guess my worthwhile takeaway would be: show up, put yourself out there, make time and space to be creative and don’t marry that with “productivity”, because creativity needs rest and playtime to flourish. So in the end I gave this book merciful 2 stars."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Today I finished the 12-week program in this book for the 4th time. The first time, I joined an online group that went through it. The second time, I attempted it alone. The last two times, I went through it with a local group that I gathered and facilitated. Every time, I learn something new -- about myself, about creativity, about my hopes and dreams. Sometimes, I find the essays and tasks cheesy and dumb. Other times, they are exactly what I need at the time. When writers ask me to recommend a book to learn how to write, I recommend this one. It's not about writing at all, not really, but about unblocking creativity. It will step on all your toes and make you work hard and stop procrastinating, but it will feel fantastic if you follow through. It's not really a book to do alone, though. If you really want to get the most out of it, find some others willing to go through it with you. Sign the contracts and commit yourselves to finishing. It's better when you have people who will call you on your bullshit when you start wimping out. It's better to have people who will be there when you realize you're a terrible artist -- people who have seen your work and who can see the qualities that make you stand out. I can't speak highly enough of this book and this process. It's not really a book you just sit down and read. You have to put in the work to get the results. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes it's hard. But it's absolutely worth it."

I feel like I just had one of the best therapy sessions. I faced my fears, anger, jealousy, core negative beliefs, and childhood events all in 222 pages (in my edition). Not only did I survive the ordeal, I came out of it stronger. And wow, that was quite a spiritual journey and a deep one. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting to get as much out of this as I did. Most readers know about the Morning Pages concept. As soon as you wake up, you write 3 pages longhand, stream-of-consciousness style. I haven’t been able to stick with this, because I struggle to function in the morning, and I’m not waking up any earlier. I do enjoy journaling in the evenings before I go to bed. The artist’s date concept was a lot of fun. For two hours every week, you do whatever fun adventurous or creative thing your inner child wants to do. Some of that deep stuff I mentioned was difficult, but it was so beneficial. I already knew that fear was my biggest creative block, but it was nice getting that confirmation. Now I’m convinced that I can face my fear. Now I’m learning to focus on the creative journey — the creative process — not the length of the trip. My favorite parts of the book were how Julia Cameron reframed anger and jealousy. She says that they’re maps that point you in the right direction if you learn how to interpret their messages. I really needed to learn this. I used to think both of those emotions were enemies, but Julia convinced me that they’re loyal friends that are trying to teach me important lessons. Of course, there are tons of affirmations and journaling exercises. What’s interesting is that she reinforced how important it is to trust your inner wisdom and your perceptions. I’ve been working on this recently, so reading about this at this moment, is what C. G. Jung calls synchronicity. Whenever I’d think or talk about my goals and dreams, I’d get hung up on “How?” Julia reminded me to focus on “What next?” in my plan and let the HOW work itself out. I wish I had read this book years ago, so if it’s still on your TBR, please don’t wait to read it and don’t rush through it when you do. There’s a lot to unpack in this book, and if you take your time, you’ll get more out of it. It’ll be worth it."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"From the beginning of the year been insanely busy - emphasis on “insane” - with all the preparation and marketing involved with the Huntress series, relaunching Huntress Moon and Blood Moon and launching Cold Moon with Thomas & Mercer in a rollout over just five months. But that’s not all there’s been to it. The last part of last year was really hard, in a professional sense. The delays in the release of Cold Moon made me anxious and depressed. At the same time that I was grappling with that, I committed myself to a complete overhaul of before taking it to print - and ended up doubling the material in the book. I’m thrilled with the result, but it took time away from my fiction writing and stretched me more thin than is really healthy for me, or anyone for that matter. Also, I’m writing Book 4 in the Huntress series and I seem to be writing three different books at once, which, while it is probably exactly the process I need to be going through, is also hugely confusing. And oh yeah – I started Book 1 of a new series set in Scotland and in LA. All of this while I have been adapting to life in a new country. That marginally speaks English, but not always. Especially after a few pints. Are we starting to get what’s wrong with this picture? It was time to stop the madness and reassess. The good news is, I didn’t have a complete nervous breakdown. The better news is, I knew how to heal myself. Some of you may be familiar with Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way – a classic on creativity, spirituality, and recovery. It’s a twelve-week program sort of based on twelve-step programs, but for artists and creativity. The Artist’s Way is a huge commitment. You do Morning Pages every day (three mandatory pages of free form writing) and an Artist Date every week, plus numerous assignments on top of that. This is what I decided to do on top of everything else I was doing. Crazy, right? But I knew I had to do something. Workaholism is a big problem for me. Let's be blunt - I get a lot of rewards from it. Certainly it pays off in a career sense – it’s kind of the job description for a screenwriter and pretty much for an author, too, if you want to make a living at it. There’s another big payoff, too. When I’m insanely busy I don’t have to think about myself much. Or at all. But you know…. that’s maybe not so great. The Artist’s Way is designed by someone who has had all those issues and knows the score, including all your sneaky little tricks. The first time I did the program, I didn’t make it all the way through the twelve weeks. I rarely did the Artist Date. I openly scoffed at and ignored most of the suggestions for fun stuff. And I certainly didn’t do some of the scary deeper work – like the week of reading deprivation. (Yes, that means an entire week of no reading. I know some of you out there just stopped breathing at the very thought). But even not doing it full out, the breakthroughs that happened for me at the time I was working the program and in the year or two after I did it were extraordinary. I finished Huntress Moon, decided to e publish it instead of going for another traditional publishing deal, and did it to big success. I got back all of my backlist of traditionally published books and launched those books as e books. I wrote my YA thriller The Space Between, and wrote a romance version of Screenwriting Tricks for Authors. I started teaching a college film class, which I loved. And, oh yeah - I met this guy This time through, the breakthroughs are already coming fast and furious. Sometimes I’m taking two weeks to do the work suggested for a week. Sometimes I’m skipping stuff. I put off the reading deprivation while I was doing copyedits, but I did it last week, a full week, and WOW. (I’ll write about that in a separate blog.). I already feel so much more aligned and focused. I can’t wait to get started with my day in the morning. In the midst of some pretty dangerous burnout, I am healing. It is an immense relief. So a huge thank you to Julia Cameron, for saving my skin - and soul - again. And for you all, some questions. Did you know about The Artist’s Way? (It’s not just for artists and writers. It’s for everyone. We’re all creative beings at our core.) Have you ever worked the program? Or is there some other way you’ve found to take stock and heal yourself in times of burnout? I’d love to hear!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I'm not one to ask for external recognition, but I'd be OK if you gave me a medal for completing not just this book, but the program! The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a how-to book -- specifically, how to overcome your creative blocks -- structured as a 12-week program. It's based on a popular workshop Cameron taught in NYC to help creative people recover their creative productivity and passion, so each week's ""lesson"" starts with a lecture (about 6-8 pages of content), is peppered with quotes from other creative people to inspire and cheer you along, and ends with a set of tasks for you to complete or not. I say ""or not"" because she says you don't have to do all the exercises to reap the benefits of creative recovery, but there is still maybe something helpful in there for you if you do them. I also say ""or not"" because this isn't school, and no one will be there to make sure you do it all. I did not feel particularly blocked when I started the program in June. But there was a group forming to complete the 12-week program together, very close to my house, on the same day each week that is generally good for me to meet. I also had a couple other ""signs from the universe"" that I should jump on board, so I did. The group was very diverse, with people from many walks of life, in very different phases of their careers and lives, some of whom are creative for a living and others who aren't. As the weeks went on, the group got progressively smaller. Several people said they wanted to ""re-launch"" their 12 weeks in the fall, but about 4 of us are seeing this cycle to the end. Having that peer group, to listen, to share things they got that maybe didn't initially resonate with me, to challenge and support each other -- what a wonderful bonus, IMHO. I'm so glad I for this group. The only real rule I put in place for myself was to do the Morning Pages exercise, which is 3 pages of writing about anything you want, every single morning. Actually, this is maybe Cameron's only rule for the program, too. In order to get maximum benefit, you've got to put in that minimum amount of effort. All the rest you can figure out and negotiate as you go along. I ended up filling a journal and running 2 pens out of ink before the 12 weeks was even over. There was something particularly satisfying about that... Cameron's writing style is a curious mix of common sense self-help, full-on new age spirituality, and gratuitous name-dropping. (FYI the book was originally published in 1992; my print copy looks like it is from 1996; and I bought the 10th anniversary Kindle version. It's the 10th anniversary edition that takes the name dropping from annoying to unbearable. If you don't like that kind of thing, just skip the introduction in the 10th anniversary edition.) Some weeks, I'd be highlighting like crazy and shouting, ""I know!!!"" at the pages. Other weeks, I'd just shrug my shoulders and just write whatever was on my mind. And it was still so helpful in so many ways. I feel not just more productive, and not just like I understand myself better, but also like I can manage my creative ebbs and flows more effectively. It's probably no coincidence that I found my sewing mojo again in the middle of the program. And the daily writing habit -- I never intend to let that go. It's been magnificent. The subtitle of the book is perfect: ""A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity."" But what isn't evident from the title or the subtitle is that this book isn't just for those in creative professions, or those with creative aspirations. If you are creating a life (which is most of us), this book is for you."

I mostly hated this book, though there were a few small things I got value from. Julia Cameron’s book feels hopelessly out of touch in 2020. This was the 25th anniversary edition, and it didn’t seem to have been updated at all to reflect modern times. Cameron also has this super aggravating way of looking at the world where she sees artists as inherently superior to all non-artists. I found myself rolling my eyes at that a lot. Her woo woo “creator”/spiritual stuff also got on my nerves and I couldn’t buy into it. She includes an abundance of quotes in every chapter like an eighth grader who just got a book of quotes from her grandma. Additionally, Cameron herself has a huge amount of privilege to live a lifestyle like this. She’s staring at idyllic mountains and scrawling morning pages, taking herself on artist dates, decorating her office, and living this chill life where all she does is create. Does she have any responsibilities?! I get that taking time for yourself is a good thing, but she seems downright selfish. The aspects I did like were the morning pages and the artist dates. Hard to take yourself on an artist date during a global pandemic, though! The morning pages are something I’ll try to keep doing moving forward as it’s a good way to take out the mental trash. Some of the tasks/questions each week were good journaling prompts, and it was a nice way to force myself to sit down and check in with myself, which I hate doing. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend this to others."

All of us except Ms. Cameron here, apparently. Now, there is a conversation to be had as to the treatment of art under capitalism, but, of course, that is not the conversation we had here. I really wanted to like this. A family friend of mine even went out of his way to gift it to me with a note discussing how much it changed his artistic life and hoping it would change mine. My dad even mentioned reading this when he was a poet in the 90’s. Alas, I hated everything beyond the most basic of basic premises of this guide. I agree that everyone can be creative. I agree that creativity can be a force for some people that strikes at random and feels like it flows through them. That’s…yeah, no, that’s it. She first lost me in the socioeconomic privilege of it all. You expect anyone who works and/or goes to school can set aside enough time to write three pages of essentially nothing a day. Mind you, these pages are utterly mandatory and quintessential to being an artist. Oh, and don’t forget how her success stories are from millionaires and rich extremely upper middle class people. Truly, the bourgeois and the elites. How, again, is this meant to be a universal guide for artists? Then it was quantity being more important than quality. Because, seriously? Apparently, god is supposed to make your work good, and it’s you’re responsibility to put it down on paper or whatever your art form may be. And…critics aren’t just jealous. The author is literally a critic! But when she does it, it’s fine, but everyone else’s criticism is invalid. Also, tell me you’re not marginalized without telling me you’re not marginalized : purposefully infantilizing yourself (and every other artist by extension) edition. Don’t worry, there’s more! Look, I get it was the 90’s, and people didn’t have any respect for disability, and eating disorders, or anything in the 90’s. But do we have to compare having an artistic block to anorexia? Or say that artists choose to have a block because being a “crippled artist” generates sympathy? Shit, man. Have a little tact."

Who should read it: People who don't realize they're drinking kool aid. The only thing I liked about this book was the practise of writing every morning, but there was so much that I didn't like that came up frequently enough that I decided to stop my progress through it. The #1 thing that turned me off was that it was geared towards people with things and money- at several points Cameron suggests helping ones 'inner artist' by buying things, or setting up an 'extra room' (what's that now?) as an art den. It's restricting and, as I don't remotely worship money or materialism, unappealing. The #2 thing that turned me off, as I am an atheist, was all the talk about God. She says at the start not to let it get in the way, but it really does, and it's unavoidable. She says you can replace God with any other spiritual force, but that's no good for an atheist; plus she gives God motivations, so... Yep, not sold."

Then she goes into luxury chapter where she rumbles about not denying ourselves a luxury in terms of buying something we have been wanting for a long time and writes how she bought herself a horse! While on the next page she goes about her friend who likes raspberries which she always considered to be too expensive to buy. This is just some examples of her non-logical absurd 12 step program that is in my opinion overly religious, repetitive (she goes on and on with the same sales speech for morning pages and inner child rubbish), annoying examples, useless name dropping, ridiculous metaphors and horrible disturbing vocabulary.

Kindle Edition. I learned to turn my creativity over to the only god I could believe in, the god of creativity, the life force Dylan Thomas called “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower.” I learned to get out of the way and let that creative force work through me. I learned to just show up at the page and write down what I heard. Writing became more like eavesdropping and less like inventing a nuclear bomb. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. xviii). Penguin Publishing Group.

Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 2). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. When people ask, “Why do we write morning pages?” I joke, “To get to the other side.” They think I am kidding, but I’m not. Morning Pages do get us to the other side: the other side of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods. Above all, they get us beyond our Censor. Beyond the reach of the Censor’s babble we find our own quiet center, the place where we hear the still, small voice that is at once our creator’s and our own. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 12). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. But what exactly is an artist date? An Artist Date is a block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist. In its most primary form, the Artist Date is an excursion, a play date that you preplan and defend against all interlopers. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 18). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In filling the well, think magic. Think delight. Think fun. Do not think duty. Do not do what you should do—spiritual sit-ups like reading a dull but recommended critical text. Do what intrigues you, explore what interests you; think mystery, not mastery. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 21). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. Give yourself permission to be a beginner. Cameron, Julia. The Artist's Way (p. 30). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

This is a book that has given me true permission to recognize my own creative genius and to realize that it is NOT too late to become the artist I might have been. Julia's writing voice is divine, she speaks gently but she puts her brilliant ideas out there firmly, because she knows they work and she wants you to believe that for yourself. This book is NOT for the painter, the poet, the musician and the potter. This book is for all of us because the simple premise behind is says we are all meant to be artists in life, and artist is defined by using your imagination and your creative genius and finding an application to life - whether that's a hobby, an outlet, or a full-blown business does not matter, and art is way beyond our cultural definition of art. Julia is brilliant at explaining this and that is why you, my dear, must read this book. Whatever industry or line of work you may be in, this book is about healing your inner artist and about valuing your own silly creative wonderful and hidden art. I LOVE the morning pages, the date with yourself, and all the other exercises at the end of the chapters. This is a book you must own. I borrowed it from the library first but had to have my own copy. And it is precisely for you if you use that awful awful phrase ""Well I'm just not that creative!"" Argh. Never say that about yourself, ever! You have a creative genius inside and this book lets you release it. One of my all-time favorite beloved books. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Julia Cameron, for this gift that will keep giving for years."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This has been an important book in my life for the past 10 years. I have gone through the process 4-5 times.I believe the book is extremely valuable for anyone who wants to have more creativity in their life, including such non-""artistic"" pursuits as creative problem solving, creative parenting, etc. I have experienced and seen others experience great results. There are some very difficult moments, especially in Chapter 8-9 when the rubber hits the road and you are asked to name your goal and how you are going to get there. It's easy to turn away at that point. Don't. Just take a chance. I'm convinced that the best way to do the program is to do it as a group with a good facilitator. Otherwise it's very difficult to pick yourself up and keep going when you inevitably fall behind. And while it's opposing what Cameron herself suggests, I do believe the facilitator needs to have a different role than the other members of the circle, to keep the group organized and to plan how the work will get done. That said, it's critical that the facilitator also be doing the program him/herself and act as a facilitator, not a know-it-all teacher. Final piece of advice-- get yourself a notebook and do all the exercises in it. The format where some exercises are in the book and some are suggested at the end leads to too much scattered, imporant work. You need to be able to look back over and see what your answers have been telling you."

Funny how when you first look at a book it is just a piece of wood or paper, and then after you read it, it becomes this representation of an immense thing of something wonderful. When I first heard of this book, the reference to Spirituality in the subtitle, 'A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity' put me off and I imagine may put some others off as well. To some 'Christians' the reference to spirituality makes them think of new-age stuff they don't like, and maybe some of the 'spiritual' people or people of other faiths may think it may be too 'Christian', and maybe atheist's will put off by all of it. I think it is written to not give offense to all the groups mentioned and that anyone who is dealing with creativity can recognize that inspiration needs to be allowed in and recognized from whatever source it is. First I want to talk about how well written this book is. I collect quotes, the ones I enjoy and want to read over and over again. This book is so well written it makes me want to copy out almost all paragraphs to my list of favorite quotes. So much wisdom and deep thoughts. It is a book I want to read over and over. Second, it is so so practical to help a person be creative. One main focus is to break through blocks, and a lot of chapters are written to help a person hunt down reasons for blocks and break through them. The author prescribes reading one chapter a week and gives some tasks to do. I was doing that, one chapter at a time, but when the end was getting closer I wanted more now and to get through all. If a person wanted to read it through, they could easily go back and do one chapter at a time, or cherry pick chapters and recommended tasks. One of the first tasks is to write 'Morning Pages' every day, which are 3 pages of longhand writing, strictly stream-of-consciousness. I have been doing this and think it is sheer genius. For many, the missed step in the process is to start and bring something forth. Some part in us stops us from just letting the creativity flow. This process helps to get the flow going, to help analyze any things in our life that is blocking us, and to create writing which then helps us to keep the flow going to our other art or projects. I think it is a must have book for someone in a creative line of work, and for the rest of us, some outlet of creativity makes our life better. For this reason I would recommend this to everyone. Lastly, I see Julia Cameron wrote other books to follow this one. As this one is so full and seems so complete in covering everything, it makes me wonder if the others are rehashing what is in here. I will be interested in hearing others opinions and reviews on them."

I just realized that there's was too much about this book that didn't work for me for it to be worth my time. It might work for some people but if you have done any other work on yourself, if you have any sort of self-esteem and if you know how your emotions work. This is definitely a waste of time. I had problems from the beginning with the take on god and chapter 5 was all about that. If you don't believe in god the way the author does once you reach chapter 5 there is basically no other way for you to go around it and get the benefit of the chapter. I know it is said at the beginning that god can represent whatever you want just while you read the book telling you exactly what god is and was god wants for you and from you there is no way to brainstorm your way out of the religious gibberish. I tried I even read ahead chapter 6 and 7 and it didn't work. So yeah, I gave up. Another thing is that I don't need to be told what to do and not do by a control freak and I sure don't need to be more controlling toward myself to become a better artist. So many useless rules while all the dark side of the work on yourself was ignored and replaced by some work on your inner child. Yeah, true I would love to eat candy but I'll do that as an adult. I don't need to get something from my old room (which is on the other side of the world anyway) I can totally be happy with what I have at home. I don't need anyone's permission to do whatever I want. This book sort of stressed me out and writing this review about it, is sort of stressing me out too actually, so I'm just going to go and forget that I ever opened it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book is chock full of New Age-y woo/dated pop psychology/AA-esque spiritualism, and even though I am working on being less of a cranky cynic I found it pinging my eyeroll instinct nearly constantly. That said, in spite of being a cranky cynic, I am discovering that my ~creative process~ is occasionally helped by a healthy dose of woo and spiritualism, so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I found the underlying thesis about creative process resonated for me, which is, it's worthwhile to pursue art because it's something that makes you happy and enriches your life, regardless of the outcome (even if you never ever sell a book or win an Oscar or whatever). (Contrast with the popular mindsets of ""art is a JOB, here is how I blogged 1k words every day to success"" or ""art is MISERY, just TEAR OPEN A VEIN AND BLEED ONTO THE PAGE"". Which, I mean, are both totally valid mindsets if they work for folks! They do not work for me.) The exercises were whatever, but I found the daily journaling and artist date practices to be useful/enjoyable, and I will probably try to keep them up."

The Artist's Way is designed to be worked through over 12 weeks. Because it was a library book, I did it in six. My friends had started the book a few weeks before me but I still think I finished first. The concept is to learn how to nurture your creative side and avoid creative blocks. I had picked up the book years ago but it didn't make an impression. I don't think I took it seriously. This time, I found I wanted to recommend it to everyone I know. Even though I did it in half the time and didn't quite do everything, I gave it a lot of effort. It's a great book but it's not perfect. I did notice that it had a way of bringing to light the weirdest issues. The first time I read it, I had a real problem with Julia Cameron's use of God. Looking back, that was a time I was working through my own issues of faith. A friend of mine has the same issue but she also took issue with Julia Cameron's use of twelve step programs. This was something that no one else noticed making us wonder where the issue for her lies. For me, I struggled with some of the more old fashioned wording. I am a woman in my thirties with a lot of future left. I struggled with Julia Cameron's questions like ""If it wasn't too late, I would...."" For me, it's not too late. I want to live in the now - not the past or the future. There's an issue there but I can't say what it is but it gives me something to explore. I read a number of reviews of this book and find that you really have to be in the right place for this book to be helpful and, sadly, it's a place of recovery. The book is designed to help those recover from their blocks but it's a hard place to pull out of. I can understand why - Julia Cameron wrote this as a substitute to her workshops. The problem is that a workshop is more supportive than a book. I can picture that people use the book alone without support of others. You need a sounding board and someone to hold your hand when it gets too tough. You need accountibility that just doesn't come with a book. I do recommend this book and have been contemplating using it to start my own workshops in my area but I don't recommend going it alone. Find other creative beings who want to work through it as well. It doesn't matter if they have blocks or not - there's still things to be learned. I start this book over (I bought a copy for my husband) next week and plan on working through it with my husband so that he can discover the tools to prevent creative blocks as he starts his own blogs and persues his own dreams."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"I literally just created a new Goodreads bookshelf called ""Life-Changing"" so I could put this book on it. I started it about a year ago and quickly realized reading it wouldn't be enough.; I'd have to actually ""do"" it. It's divided into 12 chapters, each with tasks and assignments to help you manage your fear of failure and all the beliefs that do not serve us... Each chapter is supposed to be completed in one week and I slowed the process waaaay down at times (hence it took me nearly a year to finish) but I figured doing it slowly would be better than not doing it at all. (And yes it's kind of 12-step-y and yes, the author has struggled with addictions and there's totally a let go and let God AA aspect to it, but whatevs, it works!) Even when I wasn't completing the tasks laid out in each chapter (like the three months when I did not open the book one single time, when my kids were on summer break) I was consistently doing my morning pages (about 4-5 times a week) and my weekly ""artist date"" (though if I'm being honest I do that on a monthly basis). The basic idea behind this book is that the universe's (or God's) gift to us is creativity. By using that creativity, we are giving a gift back to the world (or God). And by not only doing the assignments (most of which are fun) but by showing up on a consistent basis to journal first thing in the morning for three pages and take yourself on a ""date"" each week, you're optimizing your creativity. For me, that means writing, but for others it could be painting, theater, building a business, cooking, anything creative at all. Anyway, this book has changed my life. Here's how: -My dream gig literally fell in my lap two days after I finished the book. (Could be a coincidence but according to Cameron, it's more likely an example of divine synchronicity and you can say it's wackadoodle new age but I'm a believer). -My pitch acceptance rate went from 5% last year to 23% this year. (As a freelance writer, one ofthe ways I get work is by coming up with ideas for stories and ""pitching"" them to editors.)Mostly editors ignore them, occasionally they say no thank you, and when I'm lucky I get a yes and I can write and sell a story. I've heard 10% is a normal pitch acceptance rate but I have no way of verifying this.) -My income from writing more than doubled -I wrote for a dream publication for the first time (Runner's World) -I broke into four other new publications for the first time -I got my first $1/word assignment (big pay bump!) -I broke into two sections of the Washington Post that I'd never written for previously -One of my stories went viral -One of my essays got nasty, hateful comments (stung at the time but I feel like strangers taking a moment to hate on your work indicates a measure of success, or at the very least an audience that's wider than my mom and my husband. Is that weird?) -I was invited to join a writing critique group To be totally transparent I also started working with a business coach about a month after I started the Artist's Way and it's hard to say where the coaching ends and the Artist's Way begins. I have to give my coach a lot of credit, too. However, there are a few positive changes I can credit exclusively to this book, including: - I've kind of become a morning person. If you're going to get up early enough to write 3 longhand pages before you get interrupted, you have no choice but to get up with the birds. It feels SO good to have this quiet half hour as my morning ritual. Even if I only have time for a page or two I still enjoy the quiet time to dump the random contents of my brain onto the page. It makes me feel really grounded and helps me get in touch with what I really think/want/feel. -I love the ""permission"" the Artist's Date gives me to do things that are not necessarily productive... Some of my artist's dates have included a dance class, go to a favorite coffee shop and eat a muffin, write a letter, go for a hike, draw, and working on an art project."

It's only a few pages, and I think it's the quickest way (much faster than reading reviews) to garner if this author's way of thinking is for you. Then, if you do decide to read it, . ""The Artist's Way"" is really a workbook that entails a three-month long process that will likely end up taking longer than three months (it took me four months). It's simply not the kinda thing you can get through on borrowed time. Finally, do commit to this process alone. I never would've made it to the end without my creative accountability partner, who showed up for every step of the process alongside me. Even if you have to sign up for a virtual book club to meet this requirement, do it. If I didn't have some serious criticisms of this text, I'd be rating it five stars. In fact, I think it's the first book I've rated lower than five stars and also shelved under my ""favorites"" and ""need to re-read"" categories. Can you already tell you're in for an erratic, ambivalent ride in this review? I read this book's introduction many times since purchasing it but didn't take the plunge to commit to the process until the beginning of March/April-ish this year. I just finished reading the book tonight, because it's not a regular self-help book. It's basically a guided self-help course. If you don't accept that, if you treat it like a regular book, . If you're a creative who is content with the current state of your creativity and you're just curious what all the fuss is about, ; you won't get the fuss! What makes this book so powerful is that Cameron has written for a audience here - . If you're rolling your eyes at that, I promise you will shelve this one DNF, so don't bother. If by this point your ears are perked with intrigue, then you feel the way I did discovering this book and re-reading its introduction over and over. I was so scared to sign the ""contract"" that marks the commitment to begin the process. My advice, in addition to the advice already given, is please, do NOT let fear stop you. Before I committed to process, I self-identified as a writer and as a creative person, but the following quote truly sums up how those identifications manifested in the day to day of my life: After four months, I am writing as a habit everyday. I'm reading more. I've picked up abandoned hobbies again, like walking, crafting, and photography. I've started new hobbies like nature hiking. I've had spiritual breakthroughs, physical breakthroughs, mental breakthroughs, creative breakthroughs. I've identified as ""spiritual but not religious"" ever since I left Christianity, but now I could speak to you in concrete terms about what that means to me, personally. I feel committed to my health more than ever before, especially my mental health, and have accepted things about it that I spent my entire life up to this point running from. I've started writing poetry again, and not just as a way to work through trauma, but as a way to describe a flower, or myself at rest. I started submitting my writing for publication again. I got to this point over four months through the following process: - Cameron calls these morning pages. I wrote them at anytime of day, and am still struggling to get them done in the morningtime but, after much rebellion and finally resignation, I I feel best when they are done first thing. Yes, I missed days. No, I wasn't perfect. Some days all I wrote was how much I hated writing. I kept at it. It's a habit now. Now the pages nag at my mind until I've gotten them out, even on the difficult days. - This included doing some in-chapter journaling prompts. Some weeks I pushed it off, into two weeks. That's why it's taken me four months to finish. - I usually ended up working on both tasks Friday evenings. The most difficult tasks were the ones that required something from me everyday, or made me write about my trauma. Some tasks had me in tears, others made me joyful. I honestly don't know how some people do every single task listed every week. Godspeed. - Cameron calls these artist's dates, and I skipped them the most out of everything. I think I would have more creative work to show for myself if I hadn't. It's the biggest area of improvement I've identified for myself, and Cameron is correct that it's mostly fear that has me continually skipping out on them. So you can see, it was a lot of work that I wasn't perfect at, but I did it. Seeing this process through to the end is one of my biggest accomplishments this year, especially the daily journaling habit. I highly recommend this book, because it sparks real change. With that being said, I am disappointed that the 25th anniversary edition my partner was reading had zero changes from my 10th anniversary edition. This book was written in the 90s and it shows. It's privileged, ableist, and infuriatingly redundant in its narrow-mindedness. There were entire chapters, especially in the second half, that made me angry enough to exclaim and put the book down. Cameron's ego believes process can pull everyone into happiness out of the harshest poverty, the most clinical depression, and the strongest addiction. When this belief comes through in her writing, it comes off as tone-deaf to reality. Her advice to people in the worst circumstances is the exact same as her advice given to people in the best circumstances, and that is this book's most glaring flaw. As someone who went through this process while battling some deep dark mental health shit, let me tell you that this book is NOT the magic cure to diagnosable mental health conditions that Cameron implies it is. However, the process encourages reflection, growth, and healthy relationships. The morning pages alone are probably priceless to someone seeking help from a therapist and/or psychiatrist; they allow you to better communicate your issues to others, because they've forced you to write about them already. So put the bad advice into perspective, the way I did. If the text feels problematic enough to keep you from the process, then stop reading it, and just keep with your morning pages, artist's dates, and weekly tasks. The process is worth it."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"https://pricelesseconomics.wordpress.... As a child, English and writing were chores. I was forced to submit assignments at school and university but this was merely a means to an end. When I entered the working world I joined a research house, writing commentary each and every day. The red ink on my edited work identified that my ability to express myself in the written form was holding me back and I was forced to improve. Over time I realised that the art of writing is an important element in developing well-constructed thoughts. The difference between presenting to clients before writing a research report and presenting after is chalk and cheese. Writing allows one to digest, reflect and critique ones one work. I’ve tried to maintain and improve the skill ever since I made this connection. I mentioned this process to a friend and he recommended Julia Cameron’s The Artist Way to me because it forces one to write every day for 3 months. I didn’t quite appreciate how profound a journey it would become. ArtistsWay_pic I love the way in which Julia Cameron links creativity, spirituality and love. I’m not a religious person but I’ve long believed that we are all spiritual beings, that there is a portion of our brains or psyche that responds to or requires a spiritual connection, a belief in something bigger than our self. Many people express this need through religion but it could also be expressed through a belief in people, community or nature. I think this spiritual characteristic exists because we are social creatures with imagination and the ability to have a profound impact on each other, both positively and negatively, influence and to have a greater impact as a collective. I’ve developed this idea in my own head through my growing understanding of the impact of positivity. When we enter into interactions with the world that have positive intentions, positive thoughts and use positive worlds, the returns back to us could be exponential. Professionally, I’m an incredibly analytical and sceptical person because these are critical skills in order to seek the truth and research complex subjects. Reconciling the power of positivity with analytical scepticism is really tough but it is rewarding. Positive thoughts don’t work in every case and they cannot be relied on to achieve anything in particular. Being a selfless exuberant martyr could work for some, but that’s not what I’m advocating at all. I think a primary focus on the self is imperative towards constructive human interactions. Paraphrasing Jordan Peterson, “get your house in order before you start telling others what to do.” Positivity is also no substitute for core success skills like hard work, purposeful action, learning, asking questions, execution, etc. Being positive without taking action might make you happier but it isn’t going to take you very far. That being said, there are so many people out there in the world who can and are willing to help us on our way. Often the journey is much more colourful and beautiful when others are walking the journey with us. People love positive people and are far more likely to help someone with a positive outlook on the world as opposed to someone who is eternally grumpy and blaming others for their negative outcomes. Looking for the positive in a situation not only cheers you and those around you but it can lead to real solutions as you tend to look forward and think about what you can do to solve the problem at hand. A positive outlook, belief in other people and a constructive outlook have the ability to create numerous unintended consequences, what Julia Cameron calls “synchronicity.” Coincidental interactions. When we unexpectedly meet someone who can help us with our challenge, when we read an article that can help the person we spoke to yesterday, when we bump into an old friend that has just solved the very problem we’re drowning with… Positivity raises the probability of synchronous interactions. Through being positive, believing in the ability of others, creating connections and loving the people we make contact with we have the ability to create better outcomes – what is more spiritual than that! Thinking of creativity in this spiritual way deeply resonates with me. Historically, I would have always thought of creativity in the traditional sense. Artists, painters, writers and dancers are creative. Over time I have challenged this notion – initially through my wife who is a traditionally creative person. She taught me the power of fostering creativity and made me realise that creativity exists in all of us. Her love for dancing, theatre and just general expression of emotion triggered this process through our relationship. Julia Cameron really rammed home those connections. The book is primarily targeted at “traditional creatives” but a small amount of lateral thinking allows anyone to apply the principles to their lives. Creativity can find expression in a boring corporate job. Of course, not to the same extent as an artist but there are areas where all of us can create better outcomes. Yes, traditional activities like painting, drawing and dancing are great to trigger creativity but I’m certainly not advocating that everyone takes up a dance class. A lawyer could be more creative in the way she involves juniors, presents information, teaches colleagues and challenges outdated laws, for example. There doesn’t need to be a linear connection between the creativity and the goal someone is trying to achieve. In fact, belief in non-linear connectivity is probably required to really benefit from creativity because the benefits of involving a junior, for example, won’t be visible initially. But who knows who the junior might become, what clients they could bring in or just the gratitude they might express, which could warm your heart and push you forward. Investigating the creativity in what we do, even if it seems completely uncreative, allows us to investigate the true goals, the underlying intentions and create much more meaningful and rewarding outcomes for ourselves and others – is there a more noble outcome than that? Targeting goals without fully appreciating the intention risks generating hollow outcomes. As with anything interesting, meaningful, or powerful, the concept of creativity is tricky. Being creative and avoiding linear thinking doesn’t negate the need to generate goals and beeline towards them. The most successful people are goal orientated with priorities and to-do-lists but implementing these techniques doesn’t imply consistently linear thinking and surface level appreciation of first-order implications. The Artists Way has encouraged me to write even more than before. Apart from reaffirming the importance of writing in creating well-constructed analytics, it is fascinating to observe one’s personal thoughts on paper every day. It is a meditative and self-reflective process that allows one to notice one’s thoughts, investigate their causes, explore one’s strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies to enhance and counter them. I’d highly recommend The Artists Way but it’s much more than a book. It’s a spiritual journey of self-discovery that is likely to be very different depending on each person."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Short review: this is a bunch of nonsense. As in, it makes no sense. For the most part, I could not take it seriously and it creeped me out more than a little bit. And annoyed me a lot. Really long review: I only followed through on reading this whole book so I could, with a clear conscience, justify my analysis and conclusion that this book is mostly terrible. Honestly, I’m surprised this book has endured in what I assume is close to its original form for so long. The author flits from idea to idea, melding together a vast array of concepts and skimming the surface of many philosophical and self improvement topics. She goes from prayer to the law of attraction to setting boundaries and so on. As a result, there is no real cohesiveness to her message. It comes across as mumbo jumbo nonsense even though I think there are some good things hidden in there somewhere. But they are buried amongst a lot of completely absurd things. It’s written as a twelve week recovery program, but I don’t know what we are supposed to be recovering from. Mostly, I think it’s supposed to be creative block. If so, it seems pretty unfair, unreasonable, and unhealthy to pin that on ourselves. Especially as most of the book refers to outside factors as the source of creative block. But then, Cameron says “creativity is a spiritual issue” (week five, p. 93). So if we aren’t creative, is she really saying we need to recover from a lack of faith? This sounds a lot like evangelizing to me. What actually is the agenda here? To convert the reader to a particular belief system? Even if that is the case, it seems unreasonable to suggest someone can “recover” from something so abstract. However, Cameron frequently refers to people following the artist’s way as “recovering creatives,” which suggests that creativity itself is the “bad” thing. It just doesn’t make any sense. She probably means you want to recover your creativity, but then shouldn’t it be “recovering blocked creatives ?” She does sometimes use the noun “blocked creative” interchangeably with the noun “recovering creative.” Maybe I’m getting caught up in semantics but…it’s a book, so the words matter. And using the concept of recovery for whatever goal she is trying to achieve is at the very least misguided but potentially very harmful. She is not a mental health professional, claims no mental health training, yet is handing out assessments and advice with the air of authority that it’s justified because people have told her it works. She is telling the reader “if your creativity is blocked, this is why and what you have to do to unblock it.” She jumps from “here’s what worked for me and people I know” to “this will will work for you” without hesitation, drawing a direct line from mental health to creativity with no focus on the individual. Most unsettling to me, though, is the hypocrisy in the very idea of having a rigid instruction manual for how to be creative. The author offers numerous anecdotes of the many people she has helped and who regularly thank her for improving their lives (notably many of these are identified as millionaires who had to manfully set aside their music to learn the business with grandfather). I suspect these were people who wanted to be told what to do and she was happy to take on that role. It’s almost cultish. Or like a restrictive diet. She is taking a good thing way too far - exploiting unhappy or unfulfilled people with promise of creative breakthrough but only if you do exactly what she says and then she takes credit for any self improvement you achieve. She is saying you are broken and only she can fix you. Or perhaps it’s more accurate to say she credits the process she has developed. She even ridicules any doubt that might arise in giving full credit to her process. And at one point she insists that there be no reading AT ALL - with the glaring exception of her book, of course. It came across as predatory and any good insight she might offer was far overshadowed by the feeling I was being taken in by this book. Taken into what, though, I never figured out. It seems very audacious to claim a complete causal connection between the following “the artist’s way” and increased creativity. Can it be useful and helpful? Probably, if you want it to be. The one good takeaway for me are some useful writing prompts. But is this secret only key to unlocking success? No. And in the long run, I think following this advice would do much more harm than good. The irony is there is a whole section about how discipline will not bring creativity. Wait, what? Isn’t this whole book about discipline- a rigid process that must be followed exactly? Well, see, you still have to do the morning pages every single day and the artist date every week and every other assignment exactly on schedule, but you must do it “enthusiastically.” It shouldn’t feel like a chore even if you do it reluctantly or hate it while doing it and want to stop. So if this process doesn’t work for you, you must not have been enthusiastic about it. How convenient. Other reviews cite this as being too “new agey” and pushing a spiritual agenda. It is right there in the title. For me, this aspect was actually a source of humor. Yes, she unreservedly refers to God the Creator, and the book is very Jesus-centric despite her assurances that she doesn’t really mean God. But she presents her ideas in such a scrambled way that nothing actually makes enough sense to be either insightful or offensive. Overall, I can’t be certain what point Julia Cameron is trying to make, but I am certain that she gives me the creeps. I don’t necessarily think or know this book/process/author is malicious, but something just doesn’t sit right at all with me. I think it bothers me that this is a source that people who are really struggling will find and listen to and continue to suffer because there is very little that is useful here. There is a lot of blame placing in this book. A book that suggests READING is a self-destructive behavior. No thank you Ms. Cameron. The artist’s way is not for me. If reading is wrong, I don’t want to be right."

Run, don't walk, people... If you're open to it, this book will kickstart a super important journey whether you think of yourself as an artist or ""creative"" or whatever, or not. Julia gives you tools to stay awake to your dreams, stay creatively alive, and be patient with the unfoooolding path. This book is not perfect, and it's not a magic bullet. The Q is, are you ready to take the worthwhile risk of giving your inner artist/child a more legitimate seat at the table?! Julia can help you do it. P.S. - A major tenant of this book is that God loves creativity. We need to stay alive creatively, sometimes it's hard, and He actually does want to help. Julia talks about God quite a bit. She's a bit vague in her concept of God. Regardless of where you are coming from, it is likely the book will stir the pot, bring up questions. It was helpful for me to process a couple of these things with trusted friends. In reality, I don't think these are questions to be afraid of at all. If you are following Jesus, it will likely give you a lot to talk with him about. He'll go there with you. *IF you have read this and want to talk about it I am AVAILABLE* Hugs, a recovering creative person"

Many of the ideas are practical, such as the morning writing and you-day, and many good points made about strength, addiction, ill-intentioned allies. Etc. But there is a lot of proselytizing which is not my cup of tea (I don’t believe in any of that stuff) and there is also some magic thinking (such a writing contracts with yourself, making affirmations, etc.) with the “guarantee” that what you need will fall on your lap, or “God will provide”. I recommended this book to a few of my religious friends who like The Secret or laws of attraction type stuff but for myself I think there are more practical books out there for drowning artists lol."

I say ""rediscovering"" because most children at some time have a natural ""bent"" toward some creative outlet ( painting, writing, sculpture, acting, etc.) that is encouraged in adolescence. Yet when it's time to choose our profession, it's no longer socially acceptable in some way, so we are urged towards more ""appropriate"" careers. Anyway, it's almost like a psychology books because of the information about trauma, family impact, attachment, etc. Every chapter has exercises at the end to solidify the material. A guide in the front of the book suggests reading a chapter a week and working through the exercises. This has jump-kicked my interest in drawing and writing again. It has made me realize that my talents are valuable even though I'm not celebrated, young and at the beginning of a career, or even good at what I draw or write ... yet. So many realizations and revelations to be found about yourself! I found myself in tears at especially poignant chapters to me. It was excellent! How have I never heard of this book before now?!?"

At the end of each chapter there were exercises which were to be completed before reading the next chapter. I did not do the exercises so really can’t comment on whether this works or not. This book is definitely more about doing the work then just reading through it. And that is the main difference with this book as compared to other self-help book."

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"This book came so highly recommended that I felt compelled to buy it but it's a total waste of money. The notion that we ourselves are not creative but have to let God be creative through us and consequently that if we are not creative, then it is our own fault because we are blocked - come on. This blatant Christian propaganda and installs not only a dangerous way of thinking but it's also really offensive. Build an altar? Good grief! There are so many reasons why creatives may be unable to live their creativity to the fullest - financial or family commitments. If I sit and paint all day I make no money to pay my rent (not yet from my art anyway) - it's as simple as that. And yes, the pressure to earn money, so I can live indoors, affects my creativity. This book is patronizing new age mambo jumbo from 30 years ago and a great deal in this book is spent on the self-glorification of the author, which I find highly questionable. The notion that good luck will find you if you build an altar and let God be creative through you is irresponsible and downright harmful advice. Typical Christian propaganda - don't take any real action - be passive and patient and unblock yourself, God will make it happen, and if not, then there is something wrong with you. This makes me sick. Practical tips for Creatives: 1. Make sure you have enough money to live and if possible, save up enough to pay your bills for 3 to 6 months. If that is not possible try to set aside some time every day or every week. 2. Decide how you want to be creative and book a course, buy an actual artistic instructions book. For this do some research and find living successful artists, who publish books and courses, there is also a ton a free content available online. 3. Do the work. The time you spend on the exercises in this book could be time spent practising drawing or painting or sculpting or whatever you wish to do. 4. Artistic fulfilment and success come when you learn and practice and experience joy creating. That takes time and effort."

I was curious to see if it's really that good. I realized in the first chapter I'm not the intended audience, but kept reading it (despite it feeling like a chore), so I know whether to recommend it to other people. The book is written for a person who is severely creatively blocked - someone who hasn't been creating anything for months/years, or maybe never in their life. I'd say that for this type of person, many of the exercises would probably be useful. I personally know someone who started a new creative hobby while working through this book. (I'm not that person, and haven't been for many years, so I had no interest in doing all those exercises. Some of them did seem interesting though and I might do them if I ever get bored.) I was bothered by the mention of God on what seems to be every single page. Spirituality itself is not the issue, but the way Cameron constantly hits you over the head with God this and God that makes me want to avoid her other books because it's just so damn annoying. Cameron offers some advice on issues that even prolific creatives may struggle with, such as boundaries, releasing control over the outcome, the tendency for overwork, perfectionism, procrastination, etc. so my time reading it wasn't completely wasted. For this it gets 3 stars. I'd be careful about recommending this book to others without knowing a bit about their background and worldview. I feel this is one of those books that has to find you at the precise moment when you need it in order to be able to get the most value out of it. Those of us who missed that moment will probably just shrug and wonder what all the fuss is about."

I had read roughly half of them, and I totally agreed: Those had changed my life. On the list were several others that I had heard of, had wanted to read for a while, but had never gotten around to grabbing. Maybe because my mother died this past year, I was feeling that life was so finite, so brief, that I wanted to finally make a point of reading these books. On this list was ""The Artist's Way."" I grabbed a used copy at Half-Price Books, thinking I would save the money and also that if I liked it at all, I would be writing and highlighting it. Understatement of the year. I have tabs, highlights, markers, and have worn out the binding. It's absorbed coffee, tea, and tears. Cameron is not without her critics. Some find her a bit saccharine. I can see that, but I also can see someone who believes in what she practices. Her approach hit home with me enough to entice me to trust the process. And here I am, twelve weeks later, ready to take it to the next level. Perhaps the greatest wisdom I obtained from reading this book and working through the process is the understanding and belief that creativity is a process and art of its own reward, and I, despite almost a half-century of self-sabotage, am totally worth it. Not bad for a $7.99 purchase from the used bookstore."

Even thought I may not be in love with this book, and even if Julia Cameron took one or the central tools of her course, the morning pages, from Dorothea Brande's Becoming a Writer without having at least having credited her as inspiration, it works. ----------- First reading 2016. I've seen this book referenced by and , and finally decided to read it at a time when I felt very, very stuck in a very, very major rut. Nothing pleased, I was not capable of looking forward to doing anything. This book really helped. I did not notice any increase in my creativity (that was not the goal), but it was a great incentive to sit down and think about things that could give me pleasure or seem fun to do, to make travel plans - and then to actually start doing things that are on the list."

It requires much discipline and time to conquer the instructions in it. I put it on the shelf until this summer when I had the energy to do something for myself. I thank them, in my head and my heart every day. It is a work toward bringing out the creative ""genius"" in all of us. I got some connections to Jungian theories, which I appreciated very much, since I respected it as I was raising my children. It thought it was a nice commentary on life that my daughter turned around and presented me with a fabulous gift like this so many years later. I love how things are connected. This book enlightens the reader and also helps them deal with some of the challenges brought on by other people. One of my favorite quotes from this book is about anger: ""When people do not want to see something, they get mad at the person who shows them."" This is a great book that dissects us and shows us where to go from there."

Talking the chapter pages out with others in a group of 12 usually called your Tribe gives you more insight as to what parts can mean. To get the most out of this book is to also work out the exercises and not all will apply or seem to be helpful, but all should be looked at and tried in the way that might open new thoughts etc to you. It asked that you write three full pages daily for 12 weeks. It is like journaling but they call it Morning Pages to be done in the morning. I found even though I do not like to write in a journal that doing this writing as I got to that last page of writing every day Truths of my thoughts seem to just come out and clarity of though come through and that is what they say will happen. The longer we write meaning each day we WILL learn more about ourselves and our possibilities. Reading the book ..without.. doing the writing is really missing the impact of what this book can do for you... read but.. Write Your Pages!"

This book makes you think about art and life in a whole new meaning and way, and it truly makes me want to LIVE and write in fun, meaningful ways to take the world, even just my own little corner of it, by storm and never look back to the boring way I used to be. Yes, the author uses some terms and suggestions of activities that would fall into a “New Age” type of thinking, however her suggestions can easily be fit into a Christian worldview—I just wanted to point this out for anyone sensitive to this kind of stuff. If you’re struggling with your creativity, read this book. If you’d struggling with life, read this book. It’s really, truly amazing, and I know I will come back to it again and again and again for the rest of my life."

I quit so close to the end…But I read the last two chapters of the book tonight. This book/process made me think a lot (especially the morning pages when I was doing them consistently). There were lots of aha moments and I felt like some chapters seriously called me out. So overall positive experience. But some of Julia Cameron’s writing was way too god focused for me. Especially because she said in the beginning that you didn’t have to believe in god if you’re reading the book but then references god a TON in every single chapter and kind of expects you to believe in god. So that was not my favorite, maybe I should have expected that. She was also kinda preachy, which I guess she needed to be since she’s trying to sell this artists way process to the readers."

The best way to describe it is as a 12-week course on unblocking your own creativity through daily practices. By using this workbook, you commit to 2 practices - daily morning pages (writing 3 pages of thought streams everyday - I don't always manage to do it in the morning, aim to do it once a day) and weekly artist dates (where you dedicate quality one-on-one time with your inner artist through any activity of your choosing. For example, walking in a garden, doodling, buying coloured pens and using them, collecting shells - the key is to pay attention. This is has been a spectacular experience to understand myself better and to align everyday activities with what I value most."

I can't say I liked this, but I can't say I didn't either. It just didn't apply to me. It was a book-challenge book I had to read which is the only reason it appeared in my pile. So once I knew that this wasn't going to be helpful to me, I changed my attitude, and thought I'd look for positive messages. So, I realized it was a positive and encouraging message to those who feel like they are in a creativity rut. This review probably isn't helpful if one is trying to decide whether to read this or not. I can just say it was positive in a 'psychiatrist couch' kind of way."

While I find Julia Cameron to be very irritating and self-aggrandizing, she also presents some invitations into creativity that I embrace and welcome. Namely: artist dates, morning pages, contracts, and honoring Creativity as a freely flowing source in the world. Keeping a commitment to myself and this book helps me stay honest with writing, and coming up with creative artist dates this year was a welcome challenge. I plan to read this book again in 2021, will likely continue to grumble about JC, while also thanking her for the tools she offers."

I can’t recommend this book enough. Even if you don’t consider yourself a “creative” person (first of all, you should), you will benefit from reading this book—I promise. I bought this book on a whim, knowing very little about it; lo and behold, it has changed my life. I didn’t plan to buy it, just happened upon it in Daunt one day (and it was the last one on the shelf). I started the 12-week course in October, at a time when I was struggling to find a job, a place to live, and a general sense of purpose as a soon-to-be 25-year-old (i.e. a quarter-life crisis). I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I now write this, at the end of the course, with two good jobs, an amazing place to live, and a restored sense of creative purpose and fulfillment. None of that is an accident, and I believe most of it is due to the magic of this book. In October, I was stuck in a creative rut of paralyzing self-doubt and inaction. I knew that deep down, I wanted to pursue music more seriously, but I didn’t know how to get from point A to point B. My biggest fear at that time was the thought of performing my own music live—a professional milestone I knew was essential to any chance of success in a musical career, but of which I was utterly terrified. This may sound insane, considering I perform publicly all the time. But it felt (and still feels) completely different when it’s music I’ve written: I’m not only being judged for how well I sing but for how well I write, the contents of which are, of course, inextricably tied to who I am as a person. At the time I picked up this book, it felt impossible that I would ever get to a point where I could see myself doing that. I’m happy to say that by Week 10 of this program, I finally booked my first official gig performing my own music (happening later this year!). It may not sound like a huge accomplishment, but for me, it really was (is). That would not have been possible without this book. The morning pages have become my daily lifeline. What started as a laborious chore to sit and write 3 complete pages of stream-of-consciousness brain-dump became an absolute necessity to be able to get through a day peacefully. I now worry that I’m too reliant on the morning pages, but that’s another story… I literally never write Goodreads reviews, so I hope the mere existence of this one speaks to the quality of this book. Julia Cameron, I love you. Thank you."

That's a phrase oft said at Twelve Step meetings. And that's how I feel about this book. Julia Cameron alludes to her own participation in some sort of recovery program and borrows terminology from those programs, so it seems appropriate to use that phrase as a critique. If you're not familiar with this book, it's been around since 1992, and lots of people have used it some way. It's a twelve-week program that is supposed to cultivate your inner creativity. There are two basic tasks. One is the morning pages, three pages of stream of consciousness writing in a notebook first thing every morning. The second is a weekly artist's date, which is time you take alone to nurture your creativity. You could take a walk, have a picnic, go to a museum or cultural event, or lots of other creative things. These two hallmarks of the program are very enlightening. But this on top of reading the chapter and doing several other weekly tasks takes at least ten hours per week. I'm retired, so for me, this was a way to structure my time and find purpose. It was something like being in therapy, too, stirring up all kinds of memories and feelings. There's something very narcissistic about it all, though a Millennial told me that's a Boomer attitude. As for the actual book, the introduction and the epilogue are pretty good. The writing in the chapters in between is uneven with a lot of new age stuff and cliches. It also is really out of date as it was written before the digital age. One of the weeks, you're instructed not to read books. That was difficult for me, but many people don't read many books these days, consuming lots of digital media. I tried to limit podcasts, YouTube and TV, too. That made the exercise quite useful. Now that I've finished, we'll see what creativity lurks beneath. But overall, in spite of all the silly stuff, I'm glad I completed the program and hope to continue some of the practices."

When I signed on, I had no idea what I was signing up for. I saw “Artist”, thought, “I’m an artist! I’ll do it!” I had no idea it was a commitment of 2 1/2 hours every week for 12 weeks! Well, I did it. At the beginning, I thought, “This is so not me!” I still do. But it was an interesting road. The book has some interesting exercises throughout. Some I did, some I didn’t. I wrote the morning pages for quite a few weeks before I let that go. Although, not entirely. When I feel the need to express or work through something, I reach for the pages. The best part of this course? The women I met! Sixteen of us - different ages, different personalities, different cultures, different beliefs. And they have all been delightful. It’s usually difficult to make friends at this stage of life (60’s for me), but the majority of this group has planned to continue meeting at the library and beyond. I guess this really isn’t a review of the book. But if you pick it up, try to go through it with a group. I think it is more meaningful when you have others’ perspectives and beliefs."

I can see how it wouldn't work for some people, and I admit it's a bit ""woo""...but then, everything about my own fickle, mystical, illogical creative process is woo, and honestly I often felt like Ms. Cameron was addressing me and my own specific issues. Some people don't believe in writers block. Some people sit down and blast through words without flinching. Not me, my friends! Writing is a dance, and sometimes I feel like I was born to do it, and sometimes I'm just lying flat on my face on some desolate parquet floor that stretches on for miles, while in the distant clouds a tinny, slow-motion tango plays from invisible speakers. And then, inevitably, it starts to rain... So, yeah, pick yourself up, wring out your skirts and cummerbunds and start tap-dancing through that rain. If you slip and catch yourself, just pretend like it was part of the act. No one else will notice. I'm two weeks into my morning pages.

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Why I wanted to read this book: I don't even remember how I found out about this book, which is unusual for me. It's just kind of been at the back of my mind for a while. Someone may have recommended it to me. I may have just discovered it on my own stumbling upon books on the internet. But it sounded very good and many people have been changed by it, including myself. Ways this book changed me: 1. It helped me be much more honest with myself and aware of any little lies that I sometimes let into my system. 2. It made me think more about God as a coach who supports my dreams because he made me with them and sometimes pushes me towards them and reminds me of them with ""coincidences"" or what I like to call ""God echoes"". 3. Over and over again this book talks about how any kind of creativity is a leap of faith, bravery, confidence and how it's a spiritual practice. I would have to agree, because I've experienced creating music as a form of worship. 4. It helped me become more confident in my creative endeavors and get rid of any preconceptions that it doesn't matter. 5. It argues that everyone is meant to be creative, not just the NF types or special chosen ones. 6. Big big thing: In order to learn how to be a good artist, you have to give yourself permission to be bad at first. 7. Another big big thing: this book promotes self-love, which I think is very different than selfishness. Selfishness is unhealthy indulging in destructive self-deception that ends in actions that harm other people. Self-love is self-nurturing thoughts of encouragement and acts of kindness towards yourself (this can include naps). Because hey. People need love and healthier habits and sometimes we have to learn how to encourage ourselves. What this book is not: It is not a book that will tell you to ignore the world outside and other aspects of life in order to thrive in your creativity. In fact, this book highly encourages exercise, yoga/stretches, healthy relationships, healthy boundaries, and ""unnecessary"" hobbies that will make you a more fully rounded person. When I first started reading this book a few months ago - I gave myself room to spread it out into a few weeks longer than the prescribed 12 weeks - I was very excited because it sounded like the author was a Christian the way she talked about God, and I was excited for another reason. The exercises in it and ways of thinking reminded me of what another Christian minister, Dr Jim Richards, teaches about how what we believe highly affects everything around us. The more I kept reading this book though, the more it seemed that the author was talking more about a big energy source than a powerful being with a personality who wants a relationship with his children. However, she tries to make the book accessible to people of all backgrounds and not be preachy. One more thing. The preconceptions the author has about her audience are sometimes incorrect. Some of the exercises and questions in this book probably won't apply to you or your background. Having said those things, there is so, so, so much truth in this book that is valuable and that I've never seen in other books on writing (that includes Stephen King's book On Writing) and there's far less language in this one. I highly recommend it to any and all artists, especially anyone dealing with writer's block or creative insecurities. Take notes, think about it, talk to people about the ideas in it. It's one of those books you'll want to talk about with creative friends to confirm or disprove the ideas in it. Use the book in the way that is most helpful to you. Go read it."

But just in case you haven't found it yet, I'll write my review. This book charts a 12-chapter course to be executed over 12 weeks or more, to ""recover"" from an artistic slump. But it winds up being much more broadly applicable for finding one's creative fount for overall life rejuvenation. This book is the friend who encourages you to uncover the things you always meant to do, and make the space in your life for the unlikely, inexplicable things that uniquely make you happy and fulfilled. I'm still not someone who would describe herself as an artist, and yet artistic play and creativity are at the root of my joy and this book helped to reignite that."

This book has a few good tools and if you are struggling with discipline to work at your art then this book can help you with that. While this book contains practical tools like the ""daily pages"" and ""artist dates"" there is far too much fluff and unverifiable mumbo jumbo to recommend it to anyone. For example, There are also far too many second hand testimonials. For example, Just tell me why I should do the ""morning pages"". Tell me what they do for me! Don't tell me about some guy's (that may or may not exist) experience with your program. I've already bought the damn book! Following the ""Artist's Way"" in the book will help you if you are an artist and there is some good to come out of this book but the majority is just meaningless words meant for people who want to believe them."

I ended up pushing through anyway, because what else was there to do in lockdown other than try to rehabilitate my creativity, flippant and useless as that seemed at the time? I'm glad I did. The Artist's Way first caught my attention when I realized multiple artists across many mediums who I admired cited it as influential. I'm not sure it will be helpful to absolutely everyone and I remain puzzled as to how a book this blatantly spiritual and woo-woo has been found to be helpful by so many atheists and agnostics, but pushing past the Law of Attraction bullshit, Cameron has at the very least laid out a useful collection of exercises and probing questions that assist in investigating and pushing past creative blocks. I found much of the work I was doing aligned well with concepts and deeper questions I had already been asking myself in therapy. I think Cameron would refer to that as ""synchronicity"" rather than coincidence. I didn't consider myself to be an artist when I started this book. I still don't now that it's over. But I feel more free to engage in creative pursuits without self-criticism and that's exactly what I was hoping to achieve. I picked up the guitar again. I'm drawing little doodles simply because they amuse me. I'm writing programs in Javascript and designing woodworking projects for cat furniture. I'm making time lapse videos and memes and posting them on Instagram to my audience of <100 personal friends just because I feel like it. I'm having fun doing things I felt too paralyzed to even start a couple months ago. That's worth a lot in my book."

Because it looks like it. That is not to say that I agree 100% with every philosophy or idea in this book. It is to say that I've been able to take those ideas, bend-twist-modify and then use them to push forward my work as a writer (and artist?). The book promotes a general mindfulness that has had several helpful side effects for me - 1) It has helped me be kinder to myself 2) It has helped me turn emotions like sadness, helplessness and envy into actionable plans 3) it has helped me take the driver's seat through many occasions of anxiety and panic and ACTUALLY steer myself away 4) It has improved my relationship to food, especially in moments of stress 5) It has changed the way I see exercise and physical activity 6) It has helped me reengage with several passions I had as a child and some that I had let go off as an adult. I do have to add this disclaimer though - the book came for me at a time in my life when I was very ready and open to receiving this sort of guidance. So while some of the language and imagery can be very religious and God-oriented, I was able to be flexible and take that to mean what I needed it to mean in my life. I would still 100% recommend it to everybody in the WORLD, and only ask that you be open and receptive to modifying the ideas to suit your own concept of divinity."

This book deserves No.1 self-help book ever! A truly inspiring work helping you to look deeper into your self and leading you towards creative recovery. It is about finding and nurturing the child artist inside you. Although I liked the entire book, following sentences are worth remembering on this journey of self exploring: - To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong. There will be many times when we won’t look good—to ourselves or anyone else. We need to stop demanding that we do. It is impossible to get better and look good at the same time. - In order to move from the realm of shadows into the light of creativity, shadow artists must learn to take themselves seriously. With gentle, deliberate effort, they must nurture their artist child. Creativity is play, but for shadow artists, learning to allow themselves to play is hard work. - “If you want to work on your art, work on your life.” That’s another way of saying that in order to have self-expression, we must first have a self to express. That is the business of the morning pages: “I, myself, feel this way . . . and that way . . . and this way. . . . No one else need agree with me, but this is what I feel.” - As we lose our vagueness about our self, our values, our life situation, we become available to the moment. - We must learn to cope with the Test moments"

I was excited about it, and thought it would give me a lot of insights for my creative writing process, but I got disappointed from the beginning. It focuses a lot on god, listening to god, etc. So, I think it is not the right material for me. It is targeted to a very specific audience. Even when Julia Cameron tries to clarify in the introduction that when she refers to god it doesn’t have to be necessarily interpreted as something religious, it does feel religious when she mentions god. Her clarification sounds more like a failed attempt to have a wider audience. Also, I think this book could be useful for someone who is just (re)discovering her/his artistic self, not for people who have experimented already for some time. I had that rediscovering phase with creative writing more than three years ago... so, it’s possible that if I had started reading the book at that time, I would have appreciated it a bit more. Now I am at another level with my writing. Maybe I got to know about the book too late. So, no, I won’t read ‘The artist’s way’. Not for me, not at this moment of my life."

When it came up as an option for my 2022 reading challenge I added it to the list. I did a quick listen of it and liked what she said so much, I bought the book and have invited others to do the 12 week course with me. I completely agree that we are creative beings, with desires for creation and light deep within us. We stifle this throughout our life. I've been feeling urges to make time for creative outlets again and so this book was relevant, actionable and inspiring. I've started to do the morning pages (where you just process whatever comes to mind over three, hand written pages) and it surprised me how helpful it was almost immediately. Clearing my mind of the noise allowed me to focus on important thing and made me happier. I'm going to keep trying to do the morning pages and the artist's date. Also to work through the questions she poses for each week of the workshop. Definitely check it out!"

Personally I think it had a few interesting ideas, but mostly missed the mark. But I don't doubt that this book has a profound impact on people. The friend who recommended this was incredibly enthusiastic. ""Drop everything and read this"" were her exact words. What I found was a very woo-woo book about ""removing the blockages to your creative soul."" Maybe it's because I just came from reading a 1,000 page historical tome. But this book felt devoid of substance that might make you a better creative. Very self-indulgent. Like a grandparent saying ""you can do anything you put your mind to sweetie. Here, have a snack."" And I think that's probably the best analogy to this book. It's the grandma's cookies of creative self help. It doesn't do much about the problem but it will make you feel better about it.

I was amazed at how the reflection and journalling I did on one chapter led to conclusions and questions that were consistently unpacked in the NEXT chapter. Very clever. The book is full of meaty quotes from other artists, but Cameron has a few quote-worthy statements herself. My favourite: ""The quality of life is in proportion, always, to the capacity for delight. The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention.”"

The woman is a recovered alcoholic, and it shows in every step of the way, trying to force all the 12 steps in every chance she has. Trying to convince the people the art is a gift from god instead of hard work, discipline and lots of study, it is not only irresponsable, but total nonsense, specially the part where she tells you can't be an academic/scientific person, as well as a creative one.

This is an intense look at how to get your mojo back, or how to access it if you haven't ever had it. I had no idea this would be so much work. I am doing the course (reading the book and discussing it, along with the exercises) with a group online. We are meeting for the last time on Sunday, and I finished reading everything last night. Every last word. I even read her recommended reading list, which is whoa, full of sound titles? Interesting. But back to this. I have heard of it forever, and just didn't think it applied to me. But hey. Lately my fingers have really been itching, and I really think that my artistic bent needs to be coddled and brought back out into the light. I always liked drawing, and pottery, and photography in school. But of course once you leave school, it's harder to do those things. I don't have a pottery wheel or a darkroom. And I was always into books more than those things. But who says you can't be more than one thing? That is just one of my takeaways from this. I did have some serious resistance at first, because there is a lot of God talk, and she delves deep into childhood in the first few chapters. Well, I am more pagan than anything these days, and while she says that's okay, she still has a lot of God language. But I got over it. And the childhood stuff always seemed to assume that someone actually *paid attention* to you, when in fact, hello, my dad had his hands full just working and he no more encouraged any artistic tendencies of mine than bought me a pony. It's about the same. Even when I won an art contest in fourth grade and got tickets to a haunted house up at the high school. His one effort was actually taking me to the haunted house. But I had no more art supplies than what was required on our school lists, and that didn't even include a sketch pad. I drew on random pieces of paper and didn't even have colored pencils. So this means my knowledge of how to actually use the tools of art is woefully inadequate. But I'm working on that. So while I didn't have anyone squash my art, I also didn't have anyone encourage it (beyond the paint by numbers set that we did at my grandparents house at Christmas time). I am not sure I want to paint, but it would be fun to try. The book includes two tenets of artistic life: you must do morning pages, which I have dutifully done, and you must take yourself on an artist date, which I have tried to do. Most of the time that just means going to the craft store, but I need to get more creative about that. I guess the idea is that you will unleash some inner artist by doing these. That all being said, my art has always been writing. And this all applies to writing as well. It's all the same, essentially. One of the last tasks listed (because every chapter includes tasks to do, and some of them are easy and some of them are HARD) is to reread the book. So I am going to do that. The second to last chapter says to reread your morning pages. So I am going to do that as well. I am behind on the tasks, but I have done my best to keep up. I would like to do this again, but not during the holiday season, and to have weekly meetings instead of talking about 4 chapters at once, because we are not sharing much, just quick observations. All in all, though, I am glad I did this. And I also would warn against people charging for teaching the course, because as Julia says, there are no certified instructors, it's meant to be free. I paid $10 a month (so $30) for our person to lead us, and she has had some great insights. But I have seen folks charging $200. I know that it does take some time to lead, but the leader is meant to do the exercises as well. So they are learning too. I don't know if I will take another course. But I will reread. My book is all tabbed and ready to roll for another look through. I might wait until after things settle down a bit here, though. Do they ever? i will continue with my morning pages, and my artist dates. And I will dig out my camera, and my craft supplies, and maybe I can start making books again. I think this was the perfect time for me to do this. I am getting back to myself, and maybe that doesn't mean how I was before I got sick, but maybe a better version of me."

I did this 12-week-course twice (and stopped twice around the middle lol). The journal prompts and other tasks helped me to find myself, to get to know my fears and goals, past and future, and both of the times I had a breakthrough while being on a creative block. I’ve taught myself the bass guitar and signed up for an acting school, I started painting again and had the BEST ideas for new writing projects. I felt so motivated again, it was truly magical. With all that being said, I wish I could give this book EVERYONE around me who has trouble finding themselves. But a part in me hesitates. Because I certainly don’t agree with many things Julia Cameron says. She talks a lot about God, which she „warns“ us about in the beginning. I thought it wouldn’t be such a bad thing, if I just look past it. But damn, this truly is some privileged white middle-upper class new age spiritualism. I felt sick while reading the „Money chapter“ for example, where she kind of talks about how it is everybody’s choice to be poor. If we just build a better mindset around money, it comes easily. Umm… what? Or when she says it is okay to leave your child and other responsibilities to do more art. DAMN! This book would have been perfect, if Julia Cameron just sees that there are way more realities of life in this capitalistic, racist, sexist etc. society and people actually don’t have the privilege to do art and live from it. I am still so thankful for „The Artists Way“ and how much it has helped me. I will have my first theatre performance in a few weeks, just because of this book. I will definitely save a lot of the Journal Prompts inside of it and will use it in the future. I‘ll maybe share them with the people around me, but definitely not this book itself."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way/reviews?reviewFilters={%22languageCode%22:%22en%22},"Overall, a very insightful, and practical “handbook-style” book to help unblock creative flow for anyone engaging in the creative process. Some of it is stuff I already know, and have applied, but it’s always good to hear it again, in different ways. Morning notes and Artist Dates are practices I’ve started incorporating right away, and I think they’re pretty useful. At some point, perhaps I’ll do the whole 12-week program, but I think it’s also useful to pick the exercises that seem like they have the most direct application personally, and do those. Cameron is sometimes is a bit dogmatic about alone time and solitude. I think it’s important to have personal creative space, but I think it can, and perhaps should be, incorporated into everyday activities (washing the dishes, going for a walk) in addition to more formal times of solitude, when possible (again, hours and hours are not necessary). She touches on this in the last chapter when talking about meditative exercise, but sometimes she’s a bit dramatic about “killing” the child artist within you. I recommend Thich Nhat Hanh’s little book on Mindfulness, which goes into more depth on Mindfulness practices. That’s really the only reason I’m not giving it five stars. That said, lots of useful stuff, and definitely worth reading!"

I must one day write a longer review, but for now: Several writer friends had recommend this in the past. A wonderful mentor-friend sent me this late October, 2021 after my work exploded, when I was wildly burnt out and did not know what to do. I don't typically read books like this; I bristle at anything resembling self-help. But late last year I was desperate to find joy in work and the tumultuous journey of life again, so I wondered what might happen if I read this, worked through the exercises, suspended disbelief, and took it seriously despite myself. I began morning pages December 30th, 2021 and diligently did them every morning for a few months. Afterwards, I continued them more haphazardly. Two weeks into morning pages, I had started evangelizing this book to all my friends; I must have convinced at least 5 friends to buy it and begin morning pages themselves. I genuinely felt much more clarity, a lightness in my body, an astonishment at how a leap of faith into trusting yourself and the world more could be so valuable. This was a very big part of my year, and in part precipitated some fundamental changes in my relationship to the world, to myself, to work. Very thankful! More thoughts to come one day on emergence, leaps of faith, existentialism, attention, etc."

I’m a deeply cynical person yet very sensitive at heart - expressing myself through art is something I both yearn to do but critique very harshly - so this book struck some chords but also some nerves. And sanded some jaded edges :’) I have some pretty big issues with “law of attraction” type spirituality that ballooned in the 90s, so some parts of this book felt a bit out of touch. There are very real structural issues that prevent access to art, time, materials, space etc and discrimination that is often glazed over in this type of thinking/spiritual bypassing. However! Many of the lessons and techniques (I love artists dates and morning pages!) we’re very valuable for reflection and intentionally carving time for subconscious creative space and play. Some of the tools and activities in this book really resonated with me and for those alone I recommend the book (just read it with a big grain of salt and supplement with good doses of structural race class gender theory ;))"

Much of the advice is very good and helpful, and even some of the spiritual mumbo jumbo stuff isn't totally off base if you look at it from a Christian perspective. However, there is a LOT of spiritual mumbo jumbo, and some of the worse advice boils down to ""be selfish, jealously guard your time even from your loved ones, and put your art first before EVERYTHING."" A lot of her ""self care"" talking points sound like they're straight off a ""wellness"" Instagram page; I actually wouldn't be surprised if this book is where a lot of the unhelpful modern conceptions of ""self care"" and ""self love"" originated. Again, not all of her advice is off base, and there are some genuinely helpful sections in here. I did write a lot of quotes in my commonplace book! But that good stuff is mired in a lot of new-age spirituality that can be difficult to wade through at times. Practice discernment with this one!"
