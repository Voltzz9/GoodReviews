Book Title,Review Text
Ways of Seeing,"This book is based on a television series which can be viewed on YouTube here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfB-p... This is a really remarkable series and a remarkable, although annoying, book. The book is annoying because it should have been a coffee table book with large colour photographs and large font – instead it is a Penguin paperback with a font tending towards the unreadable and grey scale reproductions of the paintings that make them almost impossible to view. This is agonising, as really all you will want to do is studying and think about these images for hours. There is something we sort of know, even if I suspect we are completely wrong in our intuition. We have been, as humans, looking at pictures for a lot longer than we have been reading books. For the vast majority of us, literacy is a disturbingly recent invention – perhaps a hundred , maybe a hundred and fifty years for people in the first world. Churches told their Biblical stories as much in images as in words. For a long time even here the words were spoken in a language that was not understood by those listening. Learning how to read images, something so many of us assume isn’t something we need to learn, but rather is somehow immediate, takes an entire culture and also takes perhaps as long as to learn how to read. To understand how images work on us – how we are manipulated by them – that takes at least as long as it takes to learn the same things about how words work on and manipulate us. So, on one level this book is an exploration of the history of oil painting and what such paintings ‘mean’ – mean to us now in comparison to what they meant to earlier generations of people in Western societies. Because the Western tradition of painting is quite a separate thing from any other ‘world art’ traditions. He starts by saying that paintings are both still and silent. This is an interesting thing to say, because how we generally experience paintings today – or at least, learn about them – is through shows like Sister Wendy’s World Tour of Art or Simon Schama’s Power of Art. Don’t for a second get me wrong here – I loved both. But the art works displayed are anything but still or silent. There is a voice track and there is a panning and a zooming-in that turns these still and silent works into something approaching a cartoon. I had never considered the implications of this before. The painting stops being what it is, in fact, cannot remain what it is on the screen, it stops being an object that the artist created so as to speak for itself, and now requires someone to mediate between it and us, to either speak over it (explain it) or to orchestrate it (quite literally, with music) so that we are taught the proper way to read this painting. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we ‘read’ paintings and images, particularly after reading a book called Reading Images: the grammar of visual design. It is interesting that in that book it is clear that linguistic grammar has been used as a way to structure our response to the grammar of images – quite effectively, I think – but this is almost counter-intuitive. If we have had a more immediate relationship with images than with written text, why is it that we need to use the organising principles associated with written texts so as to seek to understand images? Why doesn’t that work the other way around? I know in part this is because language has been formally codified, but this, again, raises the question of why images are so resistant to such codification. Why would it be daft to explain what a verb is by reference to Mona Lisa’s eyebrows? The relationship between being naked (being without clothes) and being nude is presented here in what I take to be feminist art criticism. A nude is not merely someone without clothes – it is almost invariably a female and she is also on display, an object. In many ways she is not really the protagonist of the painting, even when she is the only person in the painting – the other person that is always present is the anonymous male viewer towards whom she is on display. He shows image after image of nude women, and even while being embraced, they are turned to the viewer, turned to their true lover, their fantasy lover, for not only are they the screen on which we project our lust, but also the reason for our weaknesses – they are, in the end, to be lusted over and to blame. No wonder they are invariably passive and languid. After corrupting the whole of male humanity, how could they not look exhausted? And that is actually the point – it is only today that a painting can be seen by quite so many people. They were never intended to be seen other than by the very few. Today paintings are pretty much what Plato said of them, representations of representations – but as such they are a demonstration of just how wealthy the owner really was. Paintings put on display the wealth of their owners – and that was a large part of what had been their purpose. Here’s me, and here’s the missus, and we are standing in front of our house, this is our bedroom, these are the oranges we have shipped in from Spain, this is our cow and, despite the late summer sun setting, these are our furs. The last program in the series looks at advertising and how it uses and distorts the language of paintings, to which it is the last dying breathe of a tradition spanning back 500 years. In oil painting we are looking at the current wealth of the owners – there is a now-ness about these paintings – this is what I look like now, this is what I own now – the fact that it is always ‘then’ in images is something everyone has become more aware of now we have cameras and something Barthes explains beautifully in his Camera Lucida. Time stops in the image, and as such all images are images of death. Life immediately marches away from them, leaving them as pure memory. So, paintings are always about the present and, as such, thus also immediately about the past – the present being just the past in waiting. But marketing images are always about the future, never about the present. Selling something is about creating a desire and that desire is not here and now, it is sometime soon. In many ways advertising doesn’t sell products – it sells envy and desire. As he points out, the rich people in oil paintings are not glamorous – glamour is beside the point. To be glamorous the viewer needs to want to emulate the people they see in the images – but the people who own paintings see themselves – so, there is no need for glamour. To sell product you need to sell a fantasy and that fantasy needs to be just out of reach, but obtainable though an exchange not actually part of the image, an exchange of money for a good, but that exchange is the point of the image. That capitalism needs such constant exchanges and that advertising creates the desires that fuel these exchanges is the open secret of our society. That said, I’d never considered the relationship with time that this creates before – how, to be economically valid units, we need to be constantly living in a fantasy future, while also being prepared to put up with just about any boredom in our all too prosaic present. No wonder advertisement is uninterested in now, it needs to be – it needs to negate now for what is to come. The book also draws a distinction between how we advertise to the working class (the promised transformation is based on Cinderella) and the middle class (the promised transformation is based on The Enchanted Palace) – for the working class buying this one product will be enough to transform you into the princess, for the middleclass investing in this bank will bring you all of the good things in life, which are, of necessity, an ensemble. There is so much to think about in this tiny book and this short series of films. I watch shows like this and I think, imagine what television could have been – but, of course, it could never have been anything of the kind. This is very much the exception that proves the rule. So, to see what television could never have been allowed to be, watch this and then go back to reading books."
Ways of Seeing,"I am not the audience for this book, mainly because I've already read and more or less digested the handful of essays and ideas on which it is based. The seven chapters break down fairly simply. 1: Benjamin's 'Work of Art'--the ability to reproduce images alters the way we encounter works of art. This seems reasonable. Nobody gets to see a Giotto without having seen a reproduction first, except someone who has no interest in the Giotto in the first place. But Berger et al* go a step further: we need to use the fact that we encounter works of art differently to undermine the ruling class's privilege and the ""specialized experts who are the clerks of the nostalgia of a ruling class in decline."" That's on page 32. Part of me, a large part, laments the fact that you'd never get that published today, not even on a website. Another part of me laments the stupidity of intellectuals who put their faith in the inherent goodness of The People. The People does not have a good track record when it comes to art appreciation. That's not to say that people can't learn to appreciate art, only that We are no better and no worse than the ruling class was. We need to learn, we need to be taught, you can't do that if you assume that We are inherently able to do the right thing. 2 & 3: Women are depicted differently from men, and, frankly, not in ways that are healthy for anyone, but particularly not for women. I agree. Which makes it breathtaking to see the authors get so many things wrong, either intentionally (cutting short the bible verse in which God punishes Eve *and Adam*); stupidly (non-Western art forms show women as active participants in sex, so that are isn't morally dubious); or in ways that are, ahem, temporally bound (""Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion."" Seventies!). 5: Oil paintings are bourgeois and generally not morally okay. Holbein's 'Ambassadors' is read as an example of this; the incredible distorted skull in the painting is the exception which proves the rule of oil paintings rather than, you know, showing that oil paintings can be self-critical, as are most good artworks of any kind. In general, the lesson of this book is that all art is bad for you, except the pieces that the authors of this book like. They like pieces by artists who can plausibly be turned into radicals, because only radicals can be interesting (Franz Hals; William Blake). They don't discuss the 20th century at all (I know they know that twentieth century art exists; perhaps, as good Benjaminian Marxists, they don't like abstraction or difficulty). They're also very uncomfortable with religious art, and want to group, e.g., Ambrosius Benson's Mary Magdalene with the absurd and/or pornographic Magdalene of later times, rather than admitting the rather obvious differences (Benson's is rich, but not, how can I put this... naked and disheveled.) Since the authors have a hard time saying what they actually like (vs. what they suspect is oppressive), you get idiocies like this: Rembrandt's famous late portrait shows a man for whom ""all has gone except a sense of the question of existence, of existence as a question."" A little thought would show that this is the sort of conservative pablum Great Artists have been serving up for generations. 6 & 7: Advertizing uses art to make you think you want things you don't want and that you can get them, so you don't need to think about what you really want, e.g., more time away from the office. This is true. In sum: I was sucked in by the idea that this was a book about understanding art. It is not. It is critical theory for high-school readers. Good for what it is, but extremely narrow in scope, and quite harmful for anyone who swallows it whole rather than taking a few minutes to worry away at its assumptions. Harmful because those who accept it will say silly things, and because those who read it and reject it out of hand (due to the rhetoric, bad arguments, or conceptual confusion) won't be challenged to, you know, care about other people. * Humorous aspect of this book: it makes a big deal about how it was written by a group of people, because, you know, individuals are bad, and groups are good. You'll note that the book is sold as a book by John Berger. You can draw the conclusion."
Ways of Seeing,"Way of Seeing, John Berger Ways of Seeing is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer John Berger and producer Mike Dibb. It was broadcast on BBC Two in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. The book Ways of Seeing was written by Berger and Dibb, along with Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, and Richard Hollis. The book consists of seven numbered essays: four using words and images; and three essays using only images. عنوانها: «شیوه های نگریستن»؛ «شیوه های دیدن»؛ «شیوه های نگاه»؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: از روز ششم ماه فوریه تا روز دوم ماه مارس سال2013میلادی عنوان: شیوه های نگریستن؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: غلامحسین فتح الله نوری؛ تهران، ویژه نگار، سال1388؛ در77ص، مصور، شابک9789649461748؛ موضوع: ادراک بصری، فن، هنر، از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20م عنوان: شیوه های نگاه؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: محمد هوشمند ویژه؛ تهران، بهجت، سال1390؛ در160ص، مصور، رنگی؛ شابک 9789642763528؛ عنوان: شیوه ��ای دیدن؛ نویسنده: جان برگر (جان برجر)؛ مترجم: زیبا مغربی؛ تهران، شورآفرین، سال1393؛ در122ص، مصور، رنگی؛ شابک9786006955278؛ جان برگر در کتاب «راه‌های دیدن» می‌گویند: (مردان به زنان می‌نگرند و زنان به خود نگاه می‌کنند، که مورد تماشا قرار گرفته‌ اند؛ این روزها، دیگر برای دوربین‌ها آسان نیست، که زنان را تنها به صورت ابزاری جنسی به نمایش بگذارند، زیرا زنان کارگردان و بازیگر، از نقش‌های خود برای عرضه‌ ی هوش و قدرت آرمانی‌شان بهره می‌گیرند؛ زنان آمریکایی تلاش فراوانی کرده‌ اند، تا دنیایی از آن خود بسازند، دنیایی که در آن اصل نگاه مردانه، نمی‌تواند از وجود آنها، هویت جنسی‌شان را به نمایش بگذارد، بلکه مجبور خواهد بود آنها را زنانی با استعداد و باهوش به تصویر بکش)»؛ پایان تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 28/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
Ways of Seeing,"First of all, this entire book is set in bold. I don't know what crazy crazyman let that through the gate at Penguin but I just felt I had to point it out right away. It's still worth reading. 4 essays and 3 pictorial essays. Really interesting stuff cutting away some of the bullshit associated with our appreciation of art. It seems like museums are doing a lot of things wrong as well as right. Chapter on oil-painting was particularly interesting but it was the last one about advertising (or ""publicity"" as it's exclusively referred to in this book) that has me thinking. Advertising not only needs you to want this shirt, this car, the entire industry must endeavor to narrow the scope of your desires to make you amenable to the culture. The mindset must always be a future, better you achieved through important purchases. The essay is horrifying enough until you realise that it's thirty years old, and this is now only one facet of a business that's grown much more insidious. The ads shown are almost quaint in their straight sell."
Ways of Seeing,"This was a great introduction to the work of John Berger, and my doubts that this would turn into something rather dull were swiftly blown away. His approach to art isn't overly complex thus you don't have to be a cultural boffin on the subject, yet its deep on a theoretical level to challenge and stimulate the old grey matter. Ways of Seeing offers not just an idea but also an invitation to see and know the world differently. As the TV series aired in 1972 (four years before I was born) I will likely turn to youtube and try to catch an episode or two, and hopefully find it as fascinating as this book. Bravo John!"
Ways of Seeing,loved this but printing a book near exclusively in helvetica is absolutely insane
Ways of Seeing,"Almost laughably disappointing. Berger obviously has the best of intentions, but his analysis is amateurish at best, pathetically reactionary (almost to the point of seeming to whine) at worst, and largely cribbed from thinkers of far greater intellectual originality and power than himself. For starters, he seems either ignorant of or unwilling to admit that what we broadly call 'mainstream visual art' is, was, and quite likely almost always has been directly tied up with wealth; with commissions, patronage, really with human commerce itself. Visual art isn't some pure, 'virginal' endeavor sullied by capitalism. Visual art is a creative activity which is intimately tied into and dependent on capitalism (really, on wealth) in the first place... and with displaying and re-affirming that wealth. His naive disgust with modern capitalism's collusion with art assumes that there was some magical time when art existed in a vacuum of economic/ideological purity, unsullied by the lucre of having to actually pay someone to produce a canvas or carve a church door or gild something. If such 'pure' art even exists in the first place, Berger provides literally no evidence for it: no examples from non-western European, 'traditional' cultures or even folk arts which might conceivably hint that some people make art for nothing more than their own personal pleasure. As if his shallow reading of these issues wasn't bad enough, he then goes on to make the utterly ludicrous claim that portraits of women, nudes, etc, show us that all women everywhere (and only ever women) are essentially shaped (really, he means warped) by the erotic gaze of male longing and domination. That's a powerful idea. It's also utterly indemonstrable and reeks of cheap psycho-analysis. Worse than that...it's a theory concocted to explain and reduce the female experience, which to be sure, has been cruelly unfair for the vast majority of human history, down into a narrow category of sexual expectation. Has John Berger ever MET an actual woman? What could be more bigoted, what could be more misogynistic, than dismissively generalizing all members of the female sex as simply 'damaged' by the male gaze, as if a single tiny statement was enough to claim to understand the full totality of the female experience and female suffering through out history? And of course, his visual examples of this are, again, cheaply cherry picked...just a few nudes (which to be sure, are pathetically offensive). Berger manages the odd feat of trying to empathize with the female subject in art and somehow making himself come across as an arrogant misogynist in the process. The problem with this book is that underneath it's crummy pseudo-analysis is a person who already knows how the world is to such a level of satisfaction that he has nothing left to discover or even really demonstrate about it. Capitalism? Oh it's ruined art. (Never mind telling us about what art from a non-capitalist culture is like) Women? Oh the poor things, they're so warped by male expectations its a miracle they can even stand up (Never mind that you don't relate any actual woman's experience at any point). Photography? Oh that's ruined art too by making images ubiquitous (never mind really examining photography fairly to see the myriad ways it has changed modern culture and modern art) This book proves one thing above all: the complacent intellectual smugness of the person who wrote it. Look, the relationship between the commercial world and the ever-changing world of visual artistic endeavor is a hugely diverse and complicated subject, as is the relationship between art and advertising. As is, especially, the relationship between gender roles and visual art through out history. Thinkers as diverse as Susan Sontag, Walter Benjamin, Virginia Woolf, Naomi Klein, etc. have all written elegantly and movingly about these topics. John Berger's ""Ways of Seeing"" tries to stand on the shoulders of such thinkers and falls off on nearly every page. Largely because the only thing Berger seems to 'see' is his own self-satisfaction."
Ways of Seeing,"Interesting little book. The author’s matter-of-factness annoyed me at times and I had the sense that he kept looking for the worst in the human nature of artists, art owners and consumers alike. If nothing else, he gives us food for thought. I enjoyed the essay on publicity images the most. For what it’s worth, I couldn’t help comparing Berger’s view that to that of Don Draper’s, leading character and quintessential ad-man of Madmen, as is expressed on the Netflix trailer: I agree with both but the latter is kinder."
Ways of Seeing,"On the top floor in the Strand Bookstore in New York, I saw a self-consciously bored worker show a struggling-to-be-bored kid with his mom to the art table. The worker was like ""well, you need this, and this, and this"" and I realized the kid must be in art school and the worker must have graduated pretty recently. The worker was like ""have you read Ways of Seeing? By John Berger?"" and wanted to have geeky enthusiasm, but kept her eyes half closed and only lifted the book two inches. The kid was like ""no, what is that?"" and trying not to care. The worker was like, totally monotone, ""well, it's really amazing. You'll have to read that. Everyone reads it. Anyway, it's awesome."" Then they went away and I picked it up, because I would like to go to art school, learn 1,000 techniques and become spiritually fulfilled, kind, married, a terrific cook, and understand flowers etc. and make informative life-affirming web shorts that are not irrelevant. In the bookstore, Ways of Seeing was boring but I decided it was my fault. Months later, I found it in a library in Santa Cruz, California. It is printed in bold type for no reason. I guess it is interesting. Oil paintings were about conspicuous consumption back in the day. Only women are conscious about what they present to the world looks-wise. Fetishizing the past helps aristocrats stay aristocrats. Capitalists turned art into a commodity. This is apparently all pulled from a BBC special which I bet is more interesting. At a certain point in your life this will BLOW YOUR MIND, but if you know in your heart that one day we will all hate stainless steel kitchens and be like ""ugh, so old fashioned, barf"" you will probably be like ""yeah, this was okay."""
Ways of Seeing,"“A minute in the world’s life passes! To paint it in its reality, and forget everything for that! To become that minute, to be the sensitive plate… give the image of what we see, forgetting everything that has appeared before our time.” -Paul Cézanne Ways of Seeing which is a series of essays and images, is based on the BBC television series which was broadcast in 1972. The book mainly focuses on how throughout the history of art women were depicted and perceived, comparing classic oil paintings with modern images used for advertisement purposes."
Ways of Seeing,"John Berger’s Ways of Seeing, based on a four-part 1972 BBC documentary series of the same name, is considered one of the most influential and accessible works of writing about art in the English language — and rightly so. Consisting of four textual essays and three picture essays bereft of text, this book deconstructs the dominant cultural ‘gaze’ towards art and connects it with the way we regard and ascribe meaning, both to works of art and to the world around us. Particularly insightful, even path-breaking, is the essay on the tradition of the Nude and how it relates to the power (and gender) dynamics between the surveyed and the surveyor. It is here that Berger illustrates the social existence of men as subjects and women as objects: The distinction created here between nakedness and nudity is also notable: One of the most important tasks performed in is that it democratises art and meaning-making, freeing it from the mystification of the art-critic and the exclusive enjoyment of the status-quo (a function also performed, albeit differently, by the invention of camera and the possibility of reproduction – both ideas dealt with in the first essay in this volume). I also found the essay on the Publicity Image and Advertising to be a particularly important theoretical intervention, revealing publicity as both a tradition of continuity and a break from the oil painting as a methodical construction of a new aspirational way of seeing (while seeing the same things: prosperity and happiness), situating envy and glamour as its centerpiece. Despite being written in the 1970s, continues to be a thoroughly important and relevant read, well into the second decade of the 21st century. I would, however, advise a word of caution with regards to its eurocentrism (and certain incorrect notions about art in the East, especially with regards women and sexuality) in some places. Given that one of the chief aims of this book is to demystify and democratise art appreciation, it makes sense that this book appears as a paperback instead of the more thematically-appropriate coffee-table format. However, what makes no sense whatsoever is that the entire book is set in a headache-inducing bold sans-serif font. My second reading of this book was from an e-copy, but the typeset was still bold and only marginally less annoying. Moreover, I’m glad that I read this in an age when paintings can be looked up on the internet, because the miniature black-and-white reproductions printed in the book are barely decipherable, let alone offering a chance for the kind of assessment this book recommends. The Penguin paperback edition of is paradoxically at odds with the book’s intrinstic argument for accessibility; a visual iteration of the value-divide between authors and publishers if you will."
Ways of Seeing,"If you are really impatient, you may go and see Trevor's brilliant review for this book. Otherwise you may wait a few weeks for mine - I don't think it would be fair to review the book without seeing the documentary."
Ways of Seeing,"""We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice."" An indispensable starting point for anyone who wants to think deeply about visual art, its meanings, and its uses in the (post)industrial age. If you're an art lover like I am (my ""art"" tag on a certain largely-defunct blogging platform runs to something like 1,300 images, for an account I started less than two years ago) is both troubling and extremely enriching. Troubling because it's impossible not to feel uneasy once you start acknowledging the commodity status which is inherent to virtually all ""high"" art produced in the age of capitalism, whether it be an oil painting commissioned by a successful merchant in 1671 to gratify his vanity and affirm his perception of the world, or a more contemporary piece fated to become a sort of monetary storage unit for the obscenely wealthy, regardless of the artist's intent or the conditions in which it was created. (Though Berger is more concerned with older works in this short book.) Troubling also because of the ease with which artistic iconography can be used to mold subconscious perceptions, to enforce entrenched attitudes and prejudices, and to lend authority to advertisements and propaganda. (For instance, there's an excellent and much-quoted essay here on the patriarchal function of ""the nude"" in western art.) Yet enriching because—well, to start with, it's always good to be attuned to the realities of the world one lives in, unpleasant or not. But also because Berger himself is not a Hater of Art or anything ridiculous like that: he simply wants us to be smarter about the way we engage with images, to internalize the notion that works are shaped by the context in which they are created and viewed, and to start to be able to pick out what is truly innovative or inspired or subversive in the visual arts by way of a contrast with what is hackneyed, safe, or insidious. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the book's origins as a TV special, Berger is about as clear and direct a prose stylist as can be imagined, and provides some great illustratory images if you can find a copy that doesn't shrink and drain them of color. (I highly recommend reading the book , where the pics are large and vibrant.) Actually, about half the essays are entirely pictorial, chains and collages of images which we are invited to fill in with our own interpretations and associations. The whole thing could be grasped by a teenager and read in an afternoon, which is not to say that it's rudimentary or unserious. It's definitely not. I've been depressed lately by discussions I've run into online about art and ideology, particularly regarding ""modern"" (i.e. abstract expressionist) works: conversations which, like so much web discourse, tend to drain the topic of all nuance and complexity in the rush to arrive at the most ""correct"" and politically defensible position. The advent of NFTs and the emergence of art-generating AI software are also spurring plenty of fervent discussion across the web; in other words, the nature and ethics of visual art are very far from settled issues. Though Berger himself sticks mostly to the block of centuries post-Renaissance and pre-photography, it was refreshing to be reminded of how good these kinds of conversations be, when facilitated by someone who knows what they're talking about and wants to encourage thoughtful examination rather than algorithmic engagement. If for my own part I've been vague about what he actually has to , it's only because I'd rather not summarize such an already-concise and graspable work. Please read it if you can. As for me, I think it's time to dig into some ."
Ways of Seeing,"“There is more than meets the eye” I recently reread Kenneth Clark's Civilization. It was based on a British documentary TV series, from the end of the 1960s. In it Clark offers a very own, but still fairly classic introduction to art. The book of John Berger (1926-2017) and the accompanying TV-series (look it up on You Tube!) was released in 1972 and was the antipode of Clark’s. Berger looked at the works of art very differently, or more correctly: he looked at the way we ""see"" very differently. To start with, he makes the reader-viewer aware of the world behind the artworks, the social context in which they came about. It is an exquisite analysis that he borrows from philosopher Walter Benjamin. Knowing that the 17th-century Dutch painter Frans Hals, for example, lived in bitter poverty when he painted group portraits of well-off citizens, does indeed make you look at those works of art very differently. With this other approach, Berger knocked down quite some sacred houses, especially those of traditional art critics and their emphasis on the creative genius and timelessness of works of art. He was forcefully criticized for it, but it must be said that he himself did not shy away from sharp polemics, also in this booklet. But Berger offers more: he also shows that ‘seeing’ happens in a specific, social context. His analysis of how women take into account how they are viewed (especially by men) is particularly lucid and unfortunately still topical. The way in which publicity influences and manipulates our visual language is also aptly articulated and represented. Berger also demonstrates the enormous impact of new techniques (reprography and the camera in Berger's time), making artworks available permanently and everywhere, regardless of their context, and therefore they are seen in a different way than before. I can imagine that 50 years ago this little book was a real eye-opener (pun intended). Nevertheless, during the reading, the impression came to me that the work is not really fresh anymore. Perhaps that is because a number of his views have since become commonplace. Perhaps it is also due to the layout of the booklet, with small black-and-white illustrations. But probably it’s Berger's rather classic marxist discourse that makes it seem a bit outdated: using words such as ""capitalist exploitation of the masses"", ""deprivation"" and ""proletariat"" now, in the 21st century, seems quite dated and even touching. Times evolve rapidly, and so does ‘seeing”."
Ways of Seeing,"This book though initially written in 1972 is still relevant to the reader today especially the essays dealing with the way women are seen in society. It is composed of seven essys, four use words and images, three only images. It discusses how women are view in society with an emphasis and concentration on European or Western culture. The images are from ads and famous European paintings. Being that I work in a museum and see paintings all day long this aspect interests me in particular. Basically the book is saying that in our European based culture women are objects, men are subjects. Men survey, women are surveyed. Since women are always on display in our society, they adjust their behaviour in order to please and fit in with our male dominated society. I reference this book many times in my own personal writings. What Mr. Berger has written still has value today. Actually in many ways not much has changed for women. We in the USA and Western Europe are a little better off because we can work, make money and have legal rights but that is not true for women in the rest of the world. Living in a Democratic or secular society does give women more control over their lives as opposed to dictatorships and theocracies. However even in the United States our actions as women and men are based on social constructs and society's defintions of how men and women should behave towards each other. Even how women view and interact with each other to the point that women are very competitive, jealous and vindictive in order to get or keep a man. But that is another story for discussion in the essays I have written."
Ways of Seeing,"2007 wrote: This book, based on a television series, explores how the art world of now has come to be by exploring what art was to humans in the past. The theories presented are very interesting and are posed with pictorial references that do very well to prove points. One interesting chapter deals exclusively with the 'Nude' in art overtime. Overtime it has been reviled, reveared, copied, censored, hidden, hoarded and abstracted. Another great chapter deals in the context in which people see art, in contrast to how they might have been meant to see it by the artist. Many pieces are painted as singular wall decorations, but now are hanging in museums next to a hundred other of these decorations. Overtime people now view art online or in sections of video, where a director controls the viewers eyes as what to see through camera tricks and narration. The chapter contemplates and guesses how this might change to experience of art over time. Changing from entertainment, to a more scholarly subject. A very interesting read."
Ways of Seeing,"“The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.” The first essay concerns how much a person's perspective is subject to change based on their surroundings and how the reproduction of art (alias photography) has negatively impacted the collective art-viewing experience. One can easily draw a parallel between this experience and the movie-going experience: how watching a movie amongst an audience is vastly different from watching it at your leisure on your couch. The essay also criticizes the imposing and more-often-than-not pseudo-intellectual culture of over-analysis of paintings. The irony, however, lies in the fact that Berger, while not empathetic with indulgent criticism, most of the time scribes down his thoughts with a definitive, autocratic tonality. The second essay talks about the male gaze. In doing so, the tone often trod the fine line between factual and sexist, but in the end, succeeded in convincing us that the author only wanted to say that it is the way it is. Nudist craft has, for decades, been invariably about the female body and hence, has remained more about objectification than anything else. The third one addresses the capitalist mentality from the 15th and 16th centuries regarding oil painting and how art regressed into merely a byproduct of consumerism. The last one retains as a continuation of that and addresses publicity and talks more in-depth about consumerist psychology, how it is a ramification of envy rather than greed. The prose is rather grandiose and, as I felt, often indulgent. It shows more than it tells (no pun intended), and while it is evident that Berger's knowledge of Western art and culture is quite astute, his text remains woefully ignorant of Orientalist art. There are maybe a couple of mentions thrown here and there, and while there's nothing wrong with a book being only about Western art, there's something definitely wrong with generalizing based on that. Also, this should've been a coffee table book. of"
Ways of Seeing,"62nd book of 2020. 20th April, my birthday. I got this as a present today, and have spent the day, on and off, reading it (between cake and beer and garden sunshine). This is usually regarded as the 'most influential' book on art ever, or at least one of them. Berger writes in a clean, no-nonsense kind of way. Despite discussing nudity in art, or the history of art, or discussing the paintings printed in the book, it's never hard to follow. I suppose someone with even no background interest in art could read it without any trouble. That being said, without any interest in art, I'd say this book wouldn't be for you. Though the book is 'Ways of Seeing' - that is very much in relation to art. A more suitable name may be 'Ways of Seeing '. Though, the final essay on capitalism/consumerism and publicity is very interesting, whatever your passions are. But, as for me, an art lover, I found this deeply insightful and fascinating. And Berger's writing was just an added bonus as he takes us on this short romp through art. There are many reproductions of art inside, and for some reason, the text is all bold. Not sure whose bright idea that was."
Ways of Seeing,"I admit I’m not well-versed in art history and theory, so that may be a reason this book affected me so deeply, but I was really struck by these essays. They’re incisive. They’re structured well. And they truly made me think. They made me think about art as a sign, a symbol, an argument, a brag, a promise, a prison. Berger is very clear about his purview here, which I appreciate. Though he mentions photography and advertising and film, and he draws contrasts to sculpture and Eastern art, the real subject of analysis is European oil paintings and, by extension, the rise of capitalism. There are both visual and written essays, and while I was initially wary about how well an essay told only through images would work, I was quickly won over. My favourite written essays were about representations of women and nudity—touching on appearance, agency, sight, maleness as the norm—and the final essay on advertising, which Berger refers to as “publicity”—touching upon classism, envy, glamour, desire, materialism, and commodification. Comparatively, my problems are rather slight. The book is set entirely in bold, which is weird. The cover is hideous; whose idea was it to just paste the first few paragraphs of the essay right onto the cover?! The images are in tiny and black and white and in some of the visual essays they run across the crease of the spine, rendering them nearly indiscernible. But I think my only criticism of the content itself is that Berger has a tendency to make some pretty definitive declarations, especially about what is and is not “exceptional.” Take this statement from p. 103: “Adriaen Brouwer was the only exceptional ‘genre’ painter.” Hmmm. Berger backs this statement up, of course, and explains why Brouwer was different from his contemporaries, but that doesn’t make it any more than an opinion presented as a fact, which rubs me the wrong way. The best thing I can say about a collection of essays is that it changed my way of thinking—my way of seeing!—and that is undoubtedly true with this book. There are layers to art criticism that never crossed my mind, layers far beyond and beneath the purely aesthetic, and I’ll be thinking about these things next time I visit an art museum. I’ll be asking questions like: who was this painted for? Who and what are the subjects? How are the people looking at me, the observer, and how are they arranged to appeal to or challenge my point of view? What sort of place would this have been hung in before it was brought to this museum? And who would have been looking at it there? And what would they have hoped to show to people who visited their home or abbey or office, to make them feel? More often than not, according to Berger, the answer to the last question is envy."
Ways of Seeing,"If you think you like looking art and going to galleries - ha - then you need to take a minute to read and listen to this conversation Berger is going to have with you. Link to the documentary (which I definitely recommend you watch to supplement the reading of the text): Will add my proper in-depth review of this later (as it really does deserve one). For now, I will just say that Berger makes us think: he makes us think about the impact of images, their history, their place in society and their role in furthering capitalist agendas. He makes us think about the image of women, the role they play in the system, the condition of modern galleries and museums, and most importantly, Berger makes us think about the modern day photograph and what it means for as a functioning member of society - it's all very insightful and he demystifies art in a fashion which is simple to understand as far as theory goes. Very marxist in his views and vocabulary (which I know will bother some) but I enjoyed that part hah."
Ways of Seeing,"All of what I picked up from this atrocity of a Book is that John Berger is a pretentious cunt. He hides behind the fact that he states he's ""demystifying"" art when in actuality he's giving you his opinion on the propaganda of art and how the artist doesn't exist. I must say first and foremost I am a huge believer in the auteur theory and author's/artist's purpose, so this is why I am opposed to this book. Berger is merely under the assumption that all art is just a way for the elite white male population to flaunt and reassure themselves that they are superior to the plebeians. I'm paraphrasing of course, but this book clearly undermines the intent of the artist. In this book Berger devalues the artist by saying that their creations are merely a tool for the elite to flaunt their wealth, as is expected from a contextualist. He only gives credit to the ""masters"" of the medium. Whom he states surpassed all the average form of art by going outside the boundaries of standard commissioned art (Such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, etc). Berger also has the problem of most contextualists, by which I mean he tries to find meaning or more accurately make up meaning whenever possible. One of the finest examples of this is when he described a simple livestock oil painting as, and I quote ""furniture with four legs in the eyes of the viewer that emphasizes the social status of their owners."" Which honestly might have some truth to it, but is more likely a showing of the owner's connection with nature or the artist's connection or attempt to bring together animals and people into the same composition. Essentially what I'm saying is that Berger's book might appeal to contextual art historians, feminists and socialists, but I feel it lacks any serious criticism or review on art as a whole. It is less of a book about how to see art and more a way to simplify art as a commodity for wealthy, sex-driven, elitist men."
Ways of Seeing,"I first read the book in 2000 as a young freshman in a class on Popular Culture and Ideology. I remember being overwhelmed by the wonderful insights of this book. Now, more than 20 years later, I can still appreciate the book, while at the same time being a bit more skeptical of its insights...and at the same time wondering if it can speak to the current moment in history. If I had to sum up the book in a few short sentences it would be this: Paintings and pictures are always for something and someone. Often, paintings and pictures express the desires of capital and the ruling class. When the artist does get a moment of triumph over the medium and its language of power, it is often a hard fought and meager one. Perhaps that short summary has done some lasting epistemic damage to the book and its meaning. After all, one of the lessons of critical works such as Berger's is that life, power, and imagery is never so simple. And yet, in my middle age years, I feel like I need critical and postmodern scholars to be less baroque in their insights and more modern. The short summary, the abstract, with all its obfuscating simplicity is needed in order to give a very ""modern"" sense of order to the world. At a time when conspiracy theories and epistemic anarchy is spreading, I wonder what John Berger would make of flat-earthers, climate change denialists, and other conspiracy theorist advocates. Are they the noble anti-establishment avant garde? I tried to find anything in this book that would speak to our unsettled times. I found brilliant insights but nothing that spoke to my own sense of unease specifically. For that reason, perhaps I enjoyed the picture essays the best this time around. Those chapters where the art and pictures were left without text to speak through me and let my anxieties and thoughts have free reign."
Ways of Seeing,"One-ish line baby napping review: Somehow missed this classic in college even with an art history minor. While some of it is pretty dated or commonplace now, I think that this is in part due to this book/series and some of the essays still pack a punch- that first one has some great lines on nearly every page and the analysis of European oil painting as a depiction of primarily the history of capitalism is a thesis that I think would still piss people off and start a debate in a classroom in a good way so power to it (and indeed I might throw that out there in a class and see what happens.)"

Ways of Seeing,"Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognizes before it can speak. But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. * * * Publicity is the life of this culture – in so far as without publicity capitalism could not survive – and at the same time publicity is its dream. Capitalism survives by forcing the majority, whom it exploits, to define their own interests as narrowly as possible. This was once achieved by extensive deprivation. Today in the developed countries it is being achieved by imposing a false standard of what is and what is not desirable."
Ways of Seeing,"A book about basic visual literacy, with 7 essays, 3 of them containing only images. It's not that he's original... he borrows a lot ideas from Walter Benjamin and Claude Levi-Strauss, but that he explains it in clear, easy language, with examples. The chapter about oil painting was especially illuminating for me, as I had never understood how to tell a ""great"" oil painting from a mediocre one, having no context in which to see them. But Berger here really dissects the historical origins of the form, and what oil really allowed artists to do that they weren't able to do before. Major turn off: the entire book is set in . I have no idea why this decision was made, but the book is worth reading, despite this huge flaw. Another smaller flaw: a book about images should definitely have been printed in color."
Ways of Seeing,this is a semi regular occurence in my life: books i was assigned to read in college that i did not read or did not read with any great diligence and then some years later i come to learn that said book slaps majorly. berger's project of translating frankfurt school seems particularly worthwhile but also it is just a fun and humane engagement with visual art
Ways of Seeing,"""We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves"""
Ways of Seeing,"Read this for my Composition class. Its a great read when first read since his main ideas stand out, have clarity, and are verified (to some degree), however re-reading it introduces the more ""radical"" ideas. In his essay he raises the idea of ""mysticification."" Which is great and all but he chooses to not define it. I had to keep going back trying to find a definition in context however failed. He seems to switch it around a lot. My Composition professor raised a good point- Berger is so against mytification but Is he mystifying art in the essay? He seems to be talking in circles, as some of his ideas lack clarity. It is a good read however a torture to analyze. I think it wasn't even meant to be analyzed. Nevertheless he raises interesting points that must be read."
Ways of Seeing,"This was intended as a companion to a television series, and perhaps it's best to reference it to another well-known book of Big Ideas intended as a companion to a television series, Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth. Given that they are both wedded to some teee veee, they're both kinda superficial. Berger is at his best when he is talking about specific paintings and how they can be interpreted. He is at his worst when he's doing art history for dummies and also trying to do Marxism for dummies, and it (unsurprisingly) comes off as Walter Benjamin for dummies. In the same way that Joseph Campbell does Carl Jung for dummies. I am not a dummy, or at least I don't think I am. So I don't need Ways of Seeing, really (and I definitely don't need Joseph Campbell in any way, shape, or form)."
Ways of Seeing,"Superb. A wonderful, succinct, concise, and pithy discussion of the history of imagery. How we got from the world of the oil painting to the world of television commercials. Great pick for anyone frustrated with --or mystified by-- 'the arts'."
Ways of Seeing,"it’s kinda bogus to me trying to rate a nonfiction book for some reason but this was very entertaining and it’s a great first look into art and the way we look at things that surrounds us from museums to publicity and how everything has a meaning, it’s very short and very easy to get thruuuu"
Ways of Seeing,"Here are some reductive summaries of the seven chapters in this book. Chapter 1: Art galleries are dumb, memes are the future. Chapter 2: Tits! Chapter 3: Men like looking at women, and pretending women are to blame for it. Chapter 4: Uh, art? I really don't know, there were runs of themes but nothing across everything. Chapter 5: Turns out they were all oil paintings. Apparently oil paintings are about owning things, where 'things' can be anything. Chapter 6: Different kinds of people. And horses. And dogs. No idea. Chapter 7: Adverts are a bit like oil paintings because they're about stuff. Okay, it might be apparent that I didn't really like this. Part of this is down to Berger's style, which seems to involve making weird and unsubstantiated claims, and then expanding airily on those claims. There are a bunch of points Berger does this in the text, but they are particularly galling when he does it with regard to the illustrations. Some examples: 1. : Berger instructs that we 'judge for yourself' about whether Hals painted some criticism of the Governesses. Well, I did, and I can't see anything to suggest that, and neither do I come away thinking that I 'know the personality traits and even habits' of the subjects, as both he and the author he quotes suggest I should. 2. : Berger says the two women have similar expressions. No, the one looks sleepy or perhaps embarrassed and the other flirtatious. 3. : Berger says that 'every square inch' of the painting appeals to the sense of touch. It doesn't. I couldn't even tell that anything was meant to be metal until I read Berger's description. My first impression was that the two subjects look staggeringly similar, and the distorted skull is weird and looks like a rendering issue. 4. : Berger says that the landowners' 'proprietary attitude towards what surrounds them' is evident in their stance and expressions. I can't see anything of the sort, they just look sort of squinty. Maybe I'm just not good at the sort of interpretation Berger likes to imagine for art. I certainly didn't get any sense of narrative in the three purely visual chapters, and struggled to even see any kind of point in any of the portfolios. My issues with Berger are larger than simply not being able to see what he sees in art, though. The title of the book is 'Ways of Seeing', and it is hard for me to escape the impression that what this refers to more than anything is the ability of art critics to see their own politics in art, regardless of anything actually visible in the piece itself. This is demonstrated by his own example. Aside from the first chapter, which presented the most convincing thesis (about shifts in the value of art), his textual chapters read like a 70's liberal hit list: he sees as important about art the objectification of women, 'possessions', and capitalism. There is no mention of realism/fabulism or anything important in different schools of art, and throughout it all he adopts a critical tone about the hegemony of European art -- despite including very few and primitive examples from any other source. I thought with the nudes he had a glimmer of a point -- the women are being objectified, and sometimes they are even being contorted so that they can be nude to the viewer. But this is almost a foundational premise of that whole class of art, and it's hardly shocking to learn that pictures of naked ladies are mostly for the pleasure of men. And, you know, for all that Berger lectures about issues with the nude, he sure seems to include a lot of them in his book. And I don't just mean in the chapters discussing nudes. Every single chapter has multiple nudes in it, though they are rarely central to anything he discusses. I wonder whether Berger himself considers his reader to be male? Regarding oil paintings and ownership, his argument seems highly contorted and bizarre, and he seems to stretch very hard to bring in snippets like ""if a man stole a potato he risked a public whipping"" which reinforce his narrative of wealth and possession and oppression without actually having anything to do with any art. Why is it that oil paintings in particular are about 'owning' the pictured thing, when that 'thing' can be anything from a landscape to people to a story to an ideal? After reading Berger, I still don't know why he thinks this, and really I grow more suspicious that he just wanted to make some appropriately Marxist noises. His analysis of advertising is less objectionable -- who doesn't find adverts annoying? -- but seems somewhat unstable when balanced on top of his wobbly oil painting thesis. He makes a series of assertions about what advertising images are, but again fails to substantiate most of these. I think the idea, really, is that you have to enter the book either 1) already agreeing with John Berger about everything, possibly because you're a liberal university student in the '70s or 2) willing to let John Berger just make sweeping statements which you will accept. The ideas in the first chapter are the most interesting, and I think the most well-argued of them all. No doubt the rest is useful as a possible perspective for thinking about art, but there is no real information being communicated here that isn't already communicated by the politics of half a century ago."
Ways of Seeing,"Berger opens this book with the claim that it is going to mostly be an edifying attempt to open a dialogue about vision and art, or at least incite the reader to start thinking for him or herself; it becomes clear pretty quickly that he is of the opinion that all thought converges rapidly & ultimately on the chronic terms, concepts and fixations of academic Marxism. Hastily and speciously reiterating Benjamin (and Heidegger, as these types like to pretend they haven't read), he gives a brief rundown on the way desire and attitude shape vision, notably leading to unfair and usually pornographic depictions of women for ""the male gaze"" (a phrase which Berger coined) ... he then drops the pretension of discussing art and spends the rest of the book explaining the evils of property ownership and, in a sub-McLuhanian waxing, advertising. The common motif in this book is the employment of kitsch, and the banal treatments of subject matters innate thereto, as the principle artwork discussed, such that the reader unacquainted with art will come away thinking that fewer than ten painters of intellectual interest every lived -- and, when occasionally deciding to note their existence, Berger claims that all artists who intelligently arranged their works did so solely as an explicit objection to capitalism. This book, then, is not so much an invitation to thought as an active and seemingly deliberate attempt to instill in its reader a sort of gnostic paranoia, that all reality ultimately reduces to 'rich man bad', and that all art, emotion, and endeavour are ultimately mere functions of this noumenal truth. Indeed, its overwhelming popularity seems to have had the intended effect, being one of many precursors to the current ""post-leftist"" epoch which presumes the same compulsive fixation on these Marxist concepts (which even they agree are untenable and nonsensical, but which it is apparently impossible to stop repeating). It's crazy to me that drivel like this is so popular, and serves as the introduction for so many to the visual arts as a subject ... although this, indeed, explains much more about so many things that strike me as crazy in the world of letters. One could blame Berger's country of birth for such intellectual disingenuity, but he was also a failed painter: there appears to be some precedent for a link between that and maliciously ignorant political mental complexes."
Ways of Seeing,"This was a really fascinating and thought provoking read. The world of art as we know it is consumed by us everyday and is both a reflection of the past and contains a mysterious cultural lens that helps us navigate through different mediums of art. By putting forward a perspective of oil-paintings, nude as a theme in art in light of feminism and publicity as the last dying breath of these art cultures, it invites you to sit and think about capitalism, democracy and what being free truly means and whether the world today has truly achieved that or just pretends it has. We’re often taught to love art and let ourselves be blown away by the interpretations of what it represents, the life it glorifies, the past it mystifies with the promise of gaining knowledge and becoming more cultured. But seldom are we driven to actually stop and think about whether the way we’re viewing art is indeed accurate or in line with the past in which it was birthed and the market through which it survived. For anyone who loves art, history and economy, this short book puts forward an interesting critique of art and society. I’m grateful to an artist (musician) I admire and follow, named Kim Namjoon, who holds a deep love for art himself for introducing this short and wonderful book to me."
Ways of Seeing,"Weird little book. It provides ample visual examples to back up its various points of view, but all of them are tiny, grayscale reproductions of historically significant oil paintings. The diminutive print also really is all in bold, as some other reviewers have mentioned, and somewhat eccentrically laid out. The whole packaging is weird. Maybe they gave this to an intern. Maybe someone was on the verge of leaving on burnout. I don't know. I can absolutely get on board with the views expressed. They run along the lines of developing an awareness against women's exploitation, consumers' exploitation, and so on and so forth. Great. But aside from a few inspired passages here and there, the writing felt a little juvenile and repetitive, and with the general appearance of the book already being an issue, the impression this read leaves on me is kinda meh. Disappointed."
Ways of Seeing,"This book really made me think about how to view art. In particular, the connection between the oil paintings of the last few hundred years and advertising images was something I had never thought about. This book also presents some insightful criticisms of the use of nudes in traditional art."
Ways of Seeing,"The book contains a series of essays, all related to art. I read this collection right after having come back from London – having spent days surrounded by art works. I had a million thoughts about art itself and museums, and art works in museums. I wrote out some of my thoughts and then came across some of the same ideas in this insightful beautiful booklet. Perhaps this is why I feel so strongly towards the first of the essays. Nevertheless, I try here to capture the essence of it, in some quotes that I deem crucial: I: • An image became a record of how X had seen Y. • The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe • If we accept that we can see that hill over there, we propose that from that hill we can be seen. The reciprocal nature of vision is more fundamental than that of spoken dialogue. And often dialogue is an attempt to verbalize this – an attempt to explain how, either metaphorically or literally, ‘you see things’, and an attempt to discover how ‘he sees things'. • An image is a sight which has been recreated or reproduced. It is an appearance, or a set of appearances, which has been detached from the place and time in which it first made its appearance and preserved – for a few moments or a few centuries. Every image embodies a way of seeing. • Yet, although every image embodies a way of seeing, our perception or appreciation of an image depends also upon our own way of seeing. • In the end, the art of the past is being mystified because a privileged minority is striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify the role of the ruling classes, and such a justification can no longer make sense in modern terms. And so, inevitably, it mystifies. • Today we see the art of the past as nobody saw it before. We actually perceive it in a different way. • The art of the past no longer exists as it once did. Its authority is lost. In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose III: • [A woman’s] nakedness is not, however, an expression of her own feelings; it is a sign of her submission to the owner’s feelings or demands. • Almost all post-Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal – either literally or metaphorically – because the sexual protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. • Here and in the European tradition generally, the convention of not painting the hair on a woman’s body helps towards the same end. Hair is associated with sexual power, with passion. The woman’s sexual passion needs to be minimized so that the spectator may feel that he has the monopoly of such passion • It is worth noticing that in other non-European traditions – in Indian art, Persian art, African art, Pre-Columbian art – nakedness is never supine in this way. And if, in these traditions, the theme of a work is sexual attraction, it is likely to show active sexual love as between two people, the woman as active as the man, the actions of each absorbing the other. V: • “What distinguishes oil painting from any other form of painting is its special ability to render the tangibility, the texture, the lustre, the solidity of what it depicts. It defines the real as that which you can put your hands on. Although its painted images are two-dimensional, its potential of illusionism is far greater than that of sculpture, for it can suggest objects possessing colour, texture and temperature, filling a space and, by implication, filling the entire world.” • “Oil paintings often depict things. Things which in reality are buyable. To have a thing painted and put on a canvas is not unlike buying it and putting it in your house. If you buy a painting you buy also the look of the thing it represents.” • “The art of any period tends to serve the ideological interests of the ruling class” • “Such a painting is a demonstration of more than the virtuosity of the artist. It confirms the owner’s wealth and habitual style of living” • “Works of art in earlier traditions celebrated wealth. But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth – which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what money could buy. And the visual desirability of what can be bought lies in its tangibility, in how it will reward the touch, the hand, of the owner.” • “Each time a painter realized that he was dissatisfied with the limited role of painting as a celebration of material property and of the status that accompanied it, he inevitably found himself struggling with the very language of his own art as understood by the tradition of his calling.”"
Ways of Seeing,"""Seeing comes before words.” Ways of reading - - meaning/ analysis. Personal perspective and context of writing or image. There is a divergence between and art and literature. Such as, if one were to apply Marxist literary criticism (Ideology) when examining a work of art. Art is in essence propaganda, thus what it represents is a statement/ critique of capitalism and social hierarchy. If one observes the surface value or façade of art, you will instantaneously connect with its beauty and profundity. Yet, what it represents, in terms of societal power and denotation is fundamental to its . However Berger states that the viewer must be open to The tension between the two aspects, [formalism and materialism] is acute. If you remain subjective and open your mind to all the potential possibilities, then the mystification of an artwork is unravelled. One indeed uses the past to justify the present, for history is always changing and evolving. The physical existence of something contains specific connotation, yet the metaphorical meaning behind something [i.e. iconology and symbolic representation] is part of a ‘. You cannot help but be magnetized by the hypocrisy of such a hypocritical undertone to a reproduced work of art! There is a continuum of thought during the process or act of looking and seeing an image, for instance regarding . For, being pushes through what is seen, like showing something rather than telling something (in words). If text accompanies an artwork, then it may enhance or exemplify what is implied.

Ways of Seeing,"I finally pulled this ""oldie but goodie"" off my shelf and read it. I wish I had years ago. Although the examples from its 1970s origin are dated, its thesis is perhaps even more valid today than then: Oil painting emerged just as the Western world entered the era of capitalism and imperialism. The technique of perspective makes the viewer the center of all he (yes, Virginia, ""he"") sees, just as ""Western man"" viewed the resources of the world. Oil paintings, therefore, became a vehicle by which Western man could enjoy, in rich realistic detail, what he owned. Since the beginning of the 20th century, art has lost this patron-satisfying confidence, but its bastard child, advertising, has perverted the view even more by presenting, not what is already owned, but what we should desire to own, thus serving the needs of capitalism even further. Yes, a few cobwebs of Marxism hang about the theory, but it provides a thought-provoking analysis of the convergence of artistic technique and social context."
Ways of Seeing,"Have been meaning to read this for ages. Was incredibly informative and well written, discussing oil paintings, depictions of women and and deconstructing our general perception of art. Loved the picture essays as I haven’t really read anything like that before. The final essay on publicity, signs and consumer advertising is probably something I’ll use in a lot in my academic life and I’m so glad to have read it."
Ways of Seeing,"A determinate and important read for anyone concerned with art, making a handful strong statements that are interesting and important to think about. was first published in the 70s and is derived from of the same name. It's a collection of seven essays that deal with art criticism, how we understand art and how we come to determine its merits, pointing at a lot that should be reconsidered. Berger successfully explains how what we see is influenced by what we believe and know. Reading images feels intuitive to us, since it's the most immediate way of communicating. As Berger points out in the opening sequence: There's one essay which talks about the difference between the and and thematises what would later be termed the male gaze and how those traditional Western oil paintings were a way of showing possession, wealth and status. Those beautiful hairless female bodies were rarely (if ever) about the women themselves, but about what their existence meant for the spectator / owner. In his last essay he handles the issue of why advertisement is so absurd and yet so effective. As he points out, what people are trying to sell us is the future – a future in which we can be envied and desired. It's a depressing thought, but sadly doesn't feel altogether wrong: but the points made were all interesting to consider. However, people who already have firm knowledge of contemporary art criticism will probably be familiar with most of these arguments, so this really just felt like a starting point."
Ways of Seeing,"Pop art-theory (it accompanied a BBC television program, that nicely distills a lot ideas about how we exist with images in the world with a mounting marxist slant channeling some Situationist concepts of the Spectacle. In a book that pulls and digests widely outside itself like this, the first essay felt surprisingly deep -- and of course turned out to be a largely a paraphrasing of Walter Benjamin's Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, which I clearly need to properly read now."
Ways of Seeing,"This book was pretty interesting. It offers a multi-pronged approach towards understanding how images and meaning are conjoined and how our historic development from art as a religious utility to art as advertisement/propaganda has only served to confuse us further. In some sense, we are inundated with images but we are not literate of their effect on us. This book seeks to compel us to not confuse the pleasures of seeing with their sly deceptions. While much of the past art (images) has been examined and studied our current relationship with art, with images, has not been. Instead, we are made to believe what is shown to us, as the narrow definitions of success and motive are foised to our awareness without much critical awareness as to how else to understand what is being proposed. Instead, we are made to focus attention on very narrow parameters often to the detriment of our extended possibilities. We do not realize what we are doing, we are made to realize what we should do; instead of why. Our interests are made in alignment with the interests of those producing the images. In some sense this is an incomplete book. It's a brave stab at what is going on, but it begs another, fuller look as to the relationship behind images, in part, because there is no critical framework. Choosing the right framework would further us greatly but as there is relatively no framework for assessing the multivalence of images, this book does not need one to do what it is doing."
Ways of Seeing,"An inspiring collection of essays about ways of seeing, or actually noticing what we see, when we look at images of reality (Like paintings or advertisements). A few of the essays are verbal; the others are visual (A collection of images. What do you see when you watch them?). With every answer these essays give, you find yourself with a few more new questions. Fascinating. Although this book was originally published in 1972, it is relevant and fresh even now. One essay, the third one, is about the role of men and women in art. Obviously a very delicate matter nowadays. No one would claim now that ‘men act and women appear’ (Page 47) because of the changing role of gender and because of new technical developments: Aren’t we all occupied with how we appear, since we started using Facebook and Instagram? I would have loved to know what John Berger and his team would have thought about that! A wonderful book for people who are interested in art or philosophy, let alone people who are interested in both, just like me. I’ll certainly look differently at art, advertising and social media, from now on!"
Ways of Seeing,"'The pursuit of individual happiness has been acknowledged as a universal right. Yet the existing social conditions make the individual feel powerless.' This book presents you with some really rare and interesting insights that will make you a lot to think about. It gives you evidence really good one that how society and media have influenced our psych. Its a great introduction for someone who is interested in arts and marketing. It gives you a lot of insights about the earlier time when media wasn't that influential with the current time, where media and advertising plays a very major role in defining art and artists. Berger talks about tradition and how it has influenced us, with also talking about the role of gender, how the art world has depicted both the sexes. This book really opens your eyes to different ways of seeing and many perspectives. I enjoyed reading this a lot, it will teach you a lot. Highly Recommended. Happy reading!"
Ways of Seeing,"I read this book in an AMTRAK train from the Bay Area to Portland. It was eye-opening :). Some of the essays are pictures only, pictures of paintings. The book is a little older, to me it portrays the spirit of its time, I enjoyed quite a few surprising moments. It definitely brightened my train ride through the night. All this Marxist vocab... As the title suggests, ""Ways of Seeing"" is about the ways we see. How our mind is formed through society and how this conditioning impacts on our perception and, well, what we see in the end. I became curious about this book, because, one, the cover is the picture of one of my favourite artists - Magritte. Second, a friend and I had wondered about why we view in the first place. I wanted nothing more than to share this book with him, but I don't know the reasons for why he did not see. So it is back sitting on my shelf. Come pick it up."
Ways of Seeing,"‘The meaning of the original work no longer lies in what it uniquely says but in what it uniquely is. How is its unique existence evaluated and defined in our present culture? It is defined as an object whose value depends upon its rarity. This value is affirmed and gauged by the price it fetches on the market. But because it is nevertheless ‘a work of art’ – and art is thought to be greater than commerce – its market price is said to be a reflection of its spiritual value. Yet the spiritual value of an object, as distinct from a message or an example, can only be explained in terms of magic or religion.’"
Ways of Seeing,"if you like this review, i now have website: www.michaelkamakana.com 281219: exactly the text i wish i had read as a young artist... also clarifies some reasons i do not like, for example much oil painting, not the ‘realist’, ‘representational’, that precedes 1900 and invention of cameras. the depiction of object, material, subject etc. is to me false, illusion, without presence, when it is what the painting is ‘of’ rather than what the painting ‘is’... i prefer abstraction, line, watercolors, graphics..."
Ways of Seeing,"This was quite an interesting read and very eye-opening with regards to how we perceive art. I especially appreciated the chapter that dealt with the way women are seen in society, with a heavy influence on European culture, and despite being written almost 30 years ago, I think it is still relevant today."
Ways of Seeing,"A compact book filled with fantastic, radical ideas. I couldn't help admire Berger's delineation of capitalism, proprietorship, publicity, the gaze on females amongst other things. It's a remarkable book to read."
Ways of Seeing,This book is hands down amazing.
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting vibey book about Sight. A real fun one in terms of both content and form. Every word is in bold EXCEPT the bolded ones!
Ways of Seeing,Seeing comes before words. The child looks and recognizes before it can speek.
Ways of Seeing,"This is an amazing introduction on seeing and critical thinking. It has profound insights into sickness and emptiness of modern society. Berger reminds us to be conscious about what you are looking at and experiencing; He criticizes traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. ‘Ways of Seeing’ was originally a 1972 BBC TV series, which rapidly became regarded as one of the most influential art programs ever made. At the very start of the first episode, John Berger takes a scalpel to ; the blade’s rough abrasion on canvas. The painting Berger cut was a facsimile, but the metaphor of the scalpel is plain: to question is to dissect. It is to cut past the scrim of beauty, and reveal more fundamental anatomies: capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, mimetic desire, and so on. This opening of Ways of Seeing presents a filmic reenactment of the argument of Walter Benjamin’s essay ; which he wrote during the terrifying onrush of fascism. He saw the crisis of European liberalism as, in part, a result of the emergence of new media, like photography and phonograph. Other machines of replication, along with these, had produced a more disturbing change in social consciousness. He was also interested in the entire network of mass mediation and the new, seemingly unanchored art form of film. He believed a broader shift is happening leading to nothing less than ‘the shattering of tradition’ and the ‘liquidation of the value of tradition in the cultural heritage’. As new forms of technological culture replaced the old, civilization moved into a halfway house of mediation, susceptible to new modes of political adventurism and mass behaviour. Too bad, it only had four episodes. Carl Sagan’s amazing television series ‘Cosmos’ too had just 12 parts. Meanwhile, ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ has 250+ episodes. As I said, it talks about sickness and emptiness of modern society… Five star for the series. Part (, , , )"
Ways of Seeing,"oh WOW this was excellent my thesis supervisor told me to watch the show this book was based off of and i am so upset that i did not discover this until my 4th year of being in the art history program. if i were a prof teaching an intro to art history class this would be a very necessary assigned reading. one of the first assignments that they make you do is a visual analysis. what do you see? what is there? what could they mean? it's a little silly describing a portrait of a woman in a blue dress standing in front of a mirror but there's so much more to say. ways of seeing gives you THE fundamentals of looking at art and how to have a critical eye. though its nothing more than the basics, i think it starts off on a really good foot. like yes oil painting was for rich people and women are depicted through the violent male gaze but then you take a few more art history classes and write a few more papers and you continue learning about art history and then you step back and see that you know how to look at art and architecture! my roman history prof said that buildings were primary sources and that was so profound to me because yes! they are! i will always argue for the importance of art history because art is so important to humanity! they are products of the time and they reflect and respond to the time and the people. they're pretty! but also sometimes they're ugly! i mostly read this on the subway so it took me a lot longer to read and also because every sentence packs a punch and really makes you think about what they're saying. the book design is really pretty and cool but the bolded lettering makes it an eyesore and the paintings deserve to be in colour!!! so much is lost without the colour and shading! i would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys art - like this literally changed my life"
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting and I enjoyed - especially the essays about the portrayal of women in the nude in art + publicity + class. I like that the end of the book says 'to be continued by the reader'; I am curious to see how the contents of this book may have an impact on my perspective.
Ways of Seeing,"finally had a chance to finish this even though it was covered in my art history classes all throughout college.. I really enjoy the discussions and implications of class n status in these essays, and i appreciate berger’s accessible tone and writing. that’s not to say that the book wasn’t immensely eloquent and well though out. i learned a lot and even though people hate on the books design i had a fantastic time looking at the pictures as they are being discussed!! do that more in art books pleaseeeeee"
Ways of Seeing,"4/5 for pure content. 0.5/5 for format and print. Considering this is a book about art, you’d really think that the editors would have put greater consideration into the font and print. My eyes were boggling at the constant bolded text and monochromatic grainy images I could barely see. It really detracted from the book tbh"
Ways of Seeing,"completes my little looking-at-paintings trilogy of a month in siena, still life with oysters and lemon and now, ways of seeing. each of these books have been some of the most engaging nonfiction ive ever read n collectively have given me such a satisfying base to think about paintings in a way thats both historical and personally interpretive. i thought this was rlly accessible n still complex enough to give me room to connect it to things outside of the page. honestly this book feels so fundamental to so many of the film theory texts ive read in school that im surprised this wasnt assigned to me at some point. each essay is rlly strong individually but its amazing how berger allows them all to build off each other n make this book feel like one coherent work. i rlly enjoyed the insights about connecting the texture of oil paintings to a violent western ideology of possession and the ways in which colonial n sexist attitudes emerge from seemingly innocent still lifes of food and silverware. endlessly brilliant, makes me even more excited to look at art"
Ways of Seeing,"the critical deconstruction of western art practices (both old and modern) were interesting and well thought out, but what I liked the most is how it romanticized visual art in the very first essay. it gave me a better perspective of my own travel photography."
Ways of Seeing,every good book has a couple sentences so evidently true it's impossible to think outside of them once you accommodate them. john berger Never. Misses. A Fucking. Sentence.
Ways of Seeing,"So nice to read a book that talked critically and unpretentiously about oil painting, honestly. Has art always been just based on commission, capitalism, and property? ""The only places relatively free of publicity are the quarters of the very rich; their money is theirs to keep."""
Ways of Seeing,"“When in love, the sight of the beloved has a completeness which no words and no embrace can match: a completeness which only the act of making love can temporarily accommodate.”"
Ways of Seeing,Some essays better than others. Starts stronger than it finishes.
Ways of Seeing,"The 1970s and 1980s saw significant shifts in the ways we thought about art history, alongside its attempts to engage popular audiences. There were BBC TV shows in the 1970s that took art history outside the academy – for the traditionalist view there was Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation and others which espoused a conventional academic art historical view. Whereas Clark’s is seen as one of those shows that had lasting power and gravitas (which it did) the show that had the impact was John Berger’s in 1972. This is the book of that show. Unlike most books of art history, this is not a large format, lavishly illustrated in colour, glossy papered text, but a small paperback (glossy paper but with small black and white illustrations) and written in an accessible, engaging, pedagogic and didactic style that demands we think, rise to the challenge and answer the questions put to us. In this sense, Berger was part of the change in art history that saw the emergence of scholars such as Janet Wolff, Marcia Pointon, Rosalind Krauss, Hal Foster and others who demanded that we understand art and art history as a social product, as a system of power and ideology with the result that pictures were not just pictures but social, cultural and political texts. In his version of this approach, Berger argues that the emergence of the canon of art as we know it and see it in the oil painting is linked to the emergence of capitalism and its peculiar deployment of power. He (and his unnamed co-authors – in the preface he says there are five authors) does this through seven essays, four written and three visual, exploring perspective and power (western art’s deployment of perspective places the viewer at the centre of the picture and valorises them, the nude, oil painting and advertising (which he calls publicity) while the visual essays argue for recognition of the place of high art in the popular present, for an understanding of power and dominance in the canon and claims to possession. When this book was published in 1972 this was a radical new way to think about old pictures on stuffy museum walls, and when I first read it in the early 1980s it remained provocative and challenging. It was with a sense of intrigue then that I came back to it 40 years after publication to consider whether it would be something I should set my students to read in an attempt to get them thinking differently about advertising. Although many of the ideas have become more mainstream, and although some of the writing has dated (for instance, it is gendered in ways we’d challenge now) the case retains its power and its pedagogic potential. It is humbling to find such a popularly accessible book that is both 40 years old and as powerful and important at is was when it first appeared. On its own terms it works, and we should not under-estimate its impact – but it will be intriguing to see what my students make of it. I am delighted to have revisited it."
Ways of Seeing,"Generally a delightful read, have yet to make notes on it. Update on 17 March: 3.5 out of 5 I first read this book on a 7-hour bus ride from Paris to Maastricht. I could feel a strong, burning gaze projecting from my left side the whole time. When the owner of that gaze, the Dutch girl that sat beside me, could no longer hold it in and asked me what was it about the book that made me seem so immersed in it, I really wanted point to the intangible conversation that started travelling between us and say, "", is exactly why."" I wasn't really reading. There was no way that one could absorb Berger throughout all that bumpiness. I merely acted like I was focused so that I didn't have to socialize. Other than my inability to enjoy normal socialization, I also couldn't quite aptly explain to her what's so mesmerizing about the book. Therefore, after 2 years, now that I'm working in an art organisation, I feel the urgent need to re-read this book. And there are only two things: 1. John Berger might be explaining things that you already know but just sit tight and sit through it because he'll explain it like you've never heard it before. The way he writes is sheer . 2. There's no better way of explaining Berger than by directly quoting him, for examples see below: The above is only the tip of the iceberg. As much as it fills my heart with wholesomeness as a pleasant read should, I believe this book is just what we all cite to make something that we wrote, which despite already making enough sense on its own, sounds better."
Ways of Seeing,"Ways of Seeing peels off the layers of difference between ""seeing"" and ""looking"" as it pertains to our perception of visual works of art. While looking is a natural phenomenon that happens through the interactions of our retinas with the outside world, seeing assumes an understanding, a context, a subject. Seeing, is an art in itself. Berger might just be one of the first people who situates ""seeing"" in this complicated setting for a wide audience. In the seven chapters of this book, Berger uncovers the social and political context of art as it has evolved through the last couple of centuries, drawing fascinating conclusions regarding the monetary value of art, its relation to our dreams, desires, bodies and class. I suspect some parts of this book, depending on the chapter and corresponding essays, are not particularly revolutionary to readers who are already familiar with said essays. For example, anyone who has read the renowned by Walter Bejamin, will not find the corresponding chapter in striking. But for others, Berger provides a thought-provoking and sensitive route. This is a wonderful book. The prose is both uncomplicated and compelling, beckoning the reader to keep reading. Berger has a gentle but keen style of writing and a sincere passion for art that radiates in-between the lines. There is a kindness, a caring, in his sensibility that I felt again and again as I read through, and yet, I can't fully describe what I mean by this. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to understand what it means to ""see"" art, and I also recommend that you take advantage of the wonderful (perhaps also melancholic; read the book to understand what I mean by this) digital accessibility of the mentioned paintings and photographs to view them in a better quality while Berger discusses them."
Ways of Seeing,"really just the best of the best!!! a lot of feelings that I've had towards visual art, and oil paintings especially, since I was a little kid were realized and validated in this book (pat on the back Nils!!) feelings like how is art valued and why does this painting have a whole room while this other equally interesting painting is stacked on top of five others in that little dark museum corner or what's the point of museums in the first place, except for a place of exclusion and cleanly clipped foliage and high-priced coffee, when you can view a painting online or why is the way we talk about art so mystifying and frustrating and ultimately kind of a let-down or what is a nude, in an academic sense, compared to just being ""naked"" or how does art serve to perpetuate class divides and subserviency or why does this ad for Dior propped up against an article about Bush-era war crimes feel not only wrong but placeless? truly the most mind-shaking book on capitalism I've read in a while. a secretly subversive, evidence-based book that uses the aesthetic of academia to fuck academia, and any type of unhealthy obsession with aesthetic prioritization in the first place, over. really really rebellious stuff and i imagine it made a lot of people mad in the 70s. feels like, dare I say it, required reading for anyone going to a museum, googling, getting an ad on insta, etc. feels really true and ultimately makes visual art feel active for the first time in a forever. i actually feel like i finally have the tools to engage and critique! long live the proletariat!!!!"
Ways of Seeing,"Perhaps one of the all time must read small books ( less than 200 pages). Revisited for a reference and ended up rereading it . As fascinating as it is pioneering ( considering it was written in 1972, way back in capitalism's childhood, well before it grew up and cast it's powerful grip around the idea of human life). Berger and co essentially chart the history of visual imagery in art, from the era of oil painting to television, slowly peeling out layer after layer teasing out the implicit messages and societal subtexts hidden within the images, and quite remarkably without preaching a communist manifesto! Berger is still alive and kicking, I would be really curious to know his views on modern-age consumerism as a culture. It would be just wonderful if he takes time out to write a sequel - possibly commenting on the new era capitalism - from designer handbags to high definition televisions, perhaps not on the idea of compulsive consumerism as such ( which has been already covered here) but more on the consumers themselves as a cohort. The need for the consumerism and perhaps suggestions about alternatives?"
Ways of Seeing,"This has been on my list since forever, the TV show and the book, but I've done absolutely nothing about it other than think about it. And now I read it in two sittings (and one shitting, very sorry about the detail but it is true, I read a bit of this while pooping) and it was very good, clear, simple and captivating. It's something that I think about very often when exploring our world and all of its stories and pictures: why is it like this, who does it serve, what do we see and what do we actually see and what is the undertone and so forth. In a way I got muuuuuch more from ""Sinut on nähty"" by Anu Silfverberg than by this but then again this did exist a long time before that so I'm not putting them against each other but saying that they complimented each other in terms of the gaze. Maybe I'm just thinking about it because the part about the way women were painted had an impact on me and was way bigger than its length. I will proceed to watch the TV series as I am extremely interested in the gaze and to see better, in everyday life and while walking through this world and when watching films and reading books. There's always a WHY and usually its pretty disappointing."
Ways of Seeing,"A small collection of short essays on art. 4 writings and 3 full of images. I found the first 2 written articles more appealing - arguments quite clear and persuasive. Though only touching the surface of some issues, they are quite articulate and thus serve as a good introduction. I don't like the last written one on publicity(7th). The fifth is so so with not that good evidence. These last 2 seem too focused on the capitalist aspect of European culture. All the issues Berger discussed since then have been studied rigorously and when read now they are now no longer ground-breaking. Still, 40 years ago, Berger's book must have had a significant impact. It must be the nature of art, and well , but when some essays feature certain works and interpret them in some certain lights, I have to disagree."
Ways of Seeing,"Highly recommended read for anyone who likes visiting art museums. This is accessible, useful and concise. Finally, I thought, something written about appreciating art which isn't unnecessarily difficult to read. If I opened an art museum I might clip the best quotes of this and stick it underneath the gallery map to give people a basic starting point to use when looking at paintings. It is enough for anyone to understand, and encourages you to seek further developments so that next time you see a piece of art you might be able to understand why it is valued. I am unsure that I understood much in the wordless 'essays' other than the similarities that were between the paintings shown. Maybe no more was to be conveyed here. I wish the written essays could have went into more detail, but maybe that is just because I liked where they were going."
Ways of Seeing,"I'm an eye. A mechanical eye. I, the machine, show you a world the way only I can see it. I free myself for today and forever from human immobility. I'm in constant movement. I approach and pull away from objects. I creep under them. I move alongside a running horse's mouth. I fall and rise with the falling and rising bodies. This is I, the machine, manoeuvring in the chaotic movements, recording one movement after another in the most complex combinations. Freed from the boundaries of time and space, I coordinate any and all points of the universe, wherever I want them to be. My way leads towards the creation of a fresh perception of the world. Thus I explain in a new way the world unknown to you."
Ways of Seeing,"With all due respect to the good folks at Five Books who recommend this book for students of art history, (https://fivebooks.com/best-books/art-...) seriously, you are much better off to watch the You Tube videos of the BBC program on which this inadequate little paperback with its sad little B&W reproductions is based. Then you can see the paintings, and the way that Berger enlarges on his ideas by using the camera to zoom in on this and that. This is a link to the first one: You Tube will follow it with the rest of the series."
Ways of Seeing,Very interesting way to look at art and made me dig deep so with future rambles to art galleries I will be looking at it a little differently but still make my own summations on what the piece is trying to convey. I took a star off as the pictures are tiny and not a good representation of what the book is trying to convey while you cant see every picture clearly. I know it takes on different perspectives but the general picture should be clear and had to google some pictures to really see them. Overall a good addition to my library.
Ways of Seeing,"Read on kindle - formatting was awful (bold typeface and postage stamp sized images). Had the formatting been improved I would have taken much more from the pictorial essays. Still, a very interesting and eye opening read. Recommended,especially if you are interested in art history and how art intersects with societal underpinnings and expectations."
Ways of Seeing,"An absolute classic--a necessary read for all art history students, but more so for those who are not deeply ingrained in the field itself. Berger popularized and democratized his content, opening wider discussions about social context and the ""social history"" of art throughout several time periods and larger themes."
Ways of Seeing,"Many of his interpretations are quite misogynistic, especially when the woman is the focus of the work. I read this many years ago, and found his writings to be bland and incorrect. He also has a very good European centric view of artists of color. Blah..."
Ways of Seeing,Not ground breaking by any means but concise quoteable and intensely readable
Ways of Seeing,Everyone should read this book.
Ways of Seeing,"Short essays and lots of pictures. Quotable, but with a lot of meaningless wisery. I enjoyed the last chapter about advertisement the most, but as a whole, the book was meh."
Ways of Seeing,i hate pretentious men
Ways of Seeing,"The novelist and artist John Berger published Ways of Seeing as a supplement to a BBC documentary series about art history in 1972. It is a slim volume. Its ideas are weak, unoriginal, and poorly reasoned. It Is certainly a good book to ignore. Not one single chapter carries much intellectual weight. A prime example of Berger’s weak reasoning is in the section on the portrayal of nude women in art. Berger’s claim is that women in Renaissance paintings appear without clothing for the purpose of being enjoyed by aristocratic male viewers. As if that needed to be explained. The owner of each painting, presumably a male though it is hard to imagine that no women ever saw this stuff, owns the nude woman depicted the same way he owns property. Her nudity symbolizes his dominance and superiority over her. Her missing pubic hair symbolizes her lack of will in making sexual choices. While these claims may be true, Berger does not offer any explanation as to why we should accept his interpretation. John Berger says it is true so we must accept it as truth, case closed. By logical extension, this is like saying you own Jimi Hendrix’s corpse because you bought one of his records. Owning a painting of a woman is not equivalent to owning a woman. The painters hired women to model for them which entails the reality that those women could accept or reject the offer of hiring themselves out as models; this means they made choices. The painters themselves did not keep women chained up in dungeons. And Berger never takes up the idea that those women may actually have wanted and chosen to be portrayed in such ways. He does not cite one instance of a Renaissance woman saying anything whatsoever about her role as a painter’s model. So where does Berger get this idea from? He never tells. He also never cites any examples of what that time’s painters or aristocratic art patrons thought about these depictions of nude women either. Yet Berger claims to know exactly what they thought. Even worse, he writes as if all upper-class European men thought identical thoughts about women and he writes as though all women have identical thoughts about how women in paintings are portrayed. Common sense would tell you that opinions vary from person to person so overgeneralizing about whole populations of people who died long before he was born is absurd. Even if we accept his claim, which does appear to be plausible, why should be so concerned anyways? If the images are symbolic depictions, we do not have to automatically accept the content of the symbol as being legitimate. Each person can agree or disagree with the merits of what is symbolized as they choose. The ability and intent of the viewer to choose interpretations is never addressed either. John Berger’s stance as a male art critic in this matter is questionable too. He interprets these paintings on behalf of women without acknowledging whether or not he even consulted with women on the matter. How does he claim to be a representative and spokesperson for women? Isn’t he denying women a voice in this issue by claiming to be the arbiter of correct interpretations on their behalf? Isn’t that a form of male domination that he would otherwise decry? After all, he complains about women not having their own voice in Renaissance art so doesn’t this make him guilty of the same crime? The chapter on oil painting is no better. Rich Europeans buy paintings of objects because owning paintings of objects is the same as owning, or at least desiring to own, the object itself. Buying and owning a painting of a farm is the same as owning a farm. But how does ho know this? Research into how art owners of the time thought about ownership and art is nonexistent in Berger’s monologue. Why is this even raised as a problem? Are we supposed to accept at face value that purchasing and owning property is inherently wrong? Berger was a communist sympathizer so his answer would be “yes, owning property is inherently wrong”. But why should this idea be accepted? Just because he says so? If property is so terrible than why did John Berger sell his own paintings? Why did he have his books published by large corporate publishing firms to be sold as objects in a capitalist marketplace? Why did he choose to live in England instead of moving to the Soviet Union which was still communist in the 1970s? In the USSR, he would not have had the freedom to paint what he wanted to and he would not be allowed to publish books that criticize the political or economic system so maybe John Berger was being just a little bit of a hypocrite by hating the system he depended on for his own intellectual freedom. The final chapter is about the direct connection between oil painting and advertising. He does provide some insight into the psychology of advertising which makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and incomplete. Advertising provokes the consumer to desire products that make them feel part of an elite, like the Renaissance era aristocracy who owned the most property. No doubt, that appears to be more or less true. But again, so what? Why is it wrong to want to buy things? There do not appear to be many people in the world who do not want to have any possessions at all. But John Berger never examines the other side of the argument. His accusatory tone is manipulative and authoritarian; he wants to lay a heavy guilt trip on his audience and in the end, guilt trips are all about controlling people. Just read what Nietzsche and Foucault had to say about the Christian church’s use of guilt as a method of coercion and domination. Ways of Seeing presents us with sparsely worded text with weak reasoning and tiny black and white pictures meant to exemplify what he says. The claims lack intellectual rigor and the pictures are so difficult to see that this whole book comes off as a poorly executed work of juvenile nonsense. It is best to pass this one over. Its proper place is in the recycling bin."
Ways of Seeing,"“You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting 'Vanity,' thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for you own pleasure.” This was enlightening and a surprisingly quick read considering the depth of the topic. I thoroughly enjoyed the perspectives on women as objects in art, on oil paintings as a product and/or catalyst of capitalism, and on publicity (my Guy Debord read earlier this year came in handy here). My only point of criticism, and one I know has to do with the time this was written and published, is the air of finality with which the authors speak about the gender binary and the (mental) cages women are put/put themselves in. This would probably have been worded differently in a re-worked edition and maybe even extended to other genders and sexualities. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in art, sociology, or critique of capitalism."
Ways of Seeing,"I'm more of a fiction and narrative nonfiction person than a theory/critique one, and it feels important to mention that here. That said, this book still feels relevant af to the image-saturated world we live in, and I wish I'd read this way back in undergrad (honestly, I think it should be required reading for most undergrads)."
Ways of Seeing,"nothing revelatory here personally, but that is likely because i am reading it so relatively late in the game. if i had read this in high school it probably would be the greatest thing ever to me. does a wonderful job of condensing a lot of ideas circulating in critical theory into very accessible and compelling arguments. really a joy to read. impossible to overstate how good this is–sure you could just read benjamin instead, but where's the instant gratification in that?"
Ways of Seeing,An important book but outdated.
Ways of Seeing,"I suggest readers watch this video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4... rather than reading the book. The video series is highly informative than the actual book. Once you finish watching the series, make sure you visit the nearby museum to practically understand what is conveyed in the video. It would dramatically change your perspective of seeing things once you finish watching the series. Yesterday I have visited the folklore art museum and railway museum in our city. it was great to experience the practical points mentioned in the video which depict our shallow way of seeing things. I was able to understand more from the video series than from reading this book."
Ways of Seeing,I liked it. I think if I'd read it as an undergrad it would have blown my mind. Though I am sort of eh about how non-European art is used as a backdrop for the uniqueness - even unique in a negative way - of European art. The looking at women chapter is ✨ iconic ✨ but I think I liked the oil painting one the most.
Ways of Seeing,vv interesting & im sure ill return to this book in future
Ways of Seeing,"Engaging, enlightening and relevant, even 50 years later. The essay on post-Renaissance nudes was particularly compelling – would be curious to know how Berger's opinions on women x art (, media, publicity) might have changed in the 2000s. Off to watch the series!"
Ways of Seeing,"I 'read' this book many years ago, still return to it, and other Berger essays, from time to time for inspiration."
Ways of Seeing,Readathon #2 - Think this will require a re read when I'm less dazzled by the sun but I thought it was succinct and a great place to start for art criticism. Would have been 4 stars but this edition being in black and white made the images harder to appreciate.
Ways of Seeing,"A bit dense, but a really enjoyable and enlightening read, especially considering I know next to nothing about art history or art criticism."
Ways of Seeing,Read this for class but throughly enjoyed it 👌
Ways of Seeing,"In this series of essays, Berger makes a strong case by establishing the historical, social and political context of visuals (paintings to billboards) and thereby explaining the ""ways of seeing"" today. Broadly the essays can be divided into four categories - the relationship between what we see and what we perceive and how our pre-conceived notions about class, beauty, gender, society affect it, the presence of females (especially female nudes) in artwork and how it has evolved under the so-called ""male gaze"", the history of oil paintings and the many nuances of its proprietorship and lastly, the power of imagery and clever advertising as a tool to drive a consumerist society. There is also a video series of the same available on Youtube."
Ways of Seeing,Best core reading so far
Ways of Seeing,so true
Ways of Seeing,"By and large, I'm not a fan of manifestos. This one was no exception. It had a lot of insight, as manifestos often do, and I learned a lot from it, which is also not atypical. But to my mind, there's something insulting about a manifesto. To borrow a metaphor from Eudora Welty, writing like this is the equivalent of serving me my brain food already cut up for me. The ideas may be deeper than a trashy romance novel (for example), but the level of respect for the audience is roughly the same. And I always tend, right or wrong, to begin judging the ideology in question through the lens of that disrespect. If they have this much distrust for people in general, then how can their ideas about life not be tainted with that fundamental distrust? Since I do not share that distrust, how much am I really going to accept the ideas they've built on it? All of that is the case, as I said, with manifestos in general. So what about this particular one? the book, is apparently based on a BBC series of the same name and with the same purpose. Their purpose is to get us to look at art in a different way (namely, and being a leftist myself I don't throw this term around lightly: in a Marxist way). They begin with a very simplistic explanation of the importance of sight (based, apparently, on the fact that we are able to see before we are able to do just about anything else—never mind that we actually start using all four of our other senses before we even open our eyes), and then go on to the importance of visual art: painting, photography, that kind of thing. Then they leap straight into the Marxism and attempt to show the ways in which art, especially painting, has always been used to promote capitalism (even, it seems, before there was capitalism) and to celebrate the virtue of the propertied class. Some of which is interesting, actually, but some of which is stretching quite a bit. In true manifesto fashion, they make sure to consistently point out the ways in which seeming exceptions actually prove the rule. Also in true manifesto fashion, they are careful to pick the most egregious examples they can find in order to make their points without looking like they picked the most egregious examples available. I have to include one quote, because I think it's so emblematic. Or, to put it another way: ""We're rubber, you're glue. Bounces off us and sticks to you."" They're right about the nature of obsession, I'm sure, but that isn't much of a defence since their own argument could be described with that sentence. Here's the thing, though. There's a lot of value in the book. I actually do have a new way of seeing art now, and I think it's a better informed way. I also have a more complex understanding of some other issues, ranging from the nature of masculinity to the nature of history to the nature of envy and beyond. All of which is good, and all of which is despite the fact that this isn't my first exposure to many of these ideas. I got this book on a recommendation from a prof in grad school, and in his class and others I did think about & discuss many of these ideas. But the value of a manifesto, I suppose, is that (since they almost completely disregard opposing viewpoints) they can really succinctly get deep into the ideas at hand. So there is a lot to be gained from a book like this. Even if I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. P.S. I must say something about the design of this book. It's horrible. Really, absolutely terrible. Take a closer look at that cover image (click on it and look at the large version). The text on there is actually the beginning of the book. It's repeated again inside, but I guess they thought they'd look more serious and utilitarian if they just started right in with the cover? This book also suffers from the same ridiculous modernist notion (later completely disavowed by Jan Tschichold, who started it) that sans-serif fonts are better than serif fonts because they are free of the ""adornment"" of serifs. They take it one step further here, and use a bold sans-serif throughout the book. Which is just dumb. Many of their other design choices (full one-inch paragraph indentations, for example) are equally dumb, and the book looks like it was thrown together in half an hour by a high-school journalism class. Really, it's just atrocious. P.P.S. The book ends, and I'm not kidding, with a page that has one line on it: The absolute pretension at work here was almost more than I had the stomach for."
The Story of Art,"Reflecting on my reading year 2016, I came to think of books that have meant a lot to me over the past decades, and the first one that came to my mind was Gombrich’s excellent introduction to art history. I will have to go back twenty years, half my life, to the year 1996. I am twenty years old, and just about to discover the pleasurable adventure called university. For Christmas, I receive a much longed-for gift card to buy books that “will help me in my studies”, and I stand in a bookstore, one of those exquisite, inexhaustible bookstores on several floors that German university cities provide, and I am browsing through options. I probably spend hours there. I can still feel the time pass, while I look, think, go through history, art, literature. I pick a book, then another one, and more still, until I have to bring one back. Gift card value is weighed against all these lovely, lovely possibilities. At this moment in time, I own one Billy bookshelf, and it is not filled yet, as my children’s books and classics are left at my parents’ house. What do I pick? I don’t remember the fiction, but I do remember picking a “start of the term offer”, Mayersches Taschenlexikon, in 34 volumes, rarely used, as the internet takes over soon, and it is inconvenient to look up definitions by going through entries in alphabetical order. Some time between 1996 and now, it falls victim to one of our many moves between cities and countries. I don’t have it anymore. I bought it out of duty. I choose one extravaganza: Gombrich. A German hardback copy, beautifully illustrated, taking a huge chunk of the gift card money. I start reading as soon as I come home. And almost magically, it opens up the world of art to me. I learn why Egyptians “walk like Egyptians”, I discover Rubens, Bernini, Raphael, Leonardo, and Delacroix,and Canova, Manet and Monet, and Picasso, Duchamp and, and, and... I discover the world through a visual prism. Ever since then, Gombrich has followed my path. I soon come to read his more specialised works on form, function and symbolism in Renaissance art, I learn about his life, deeply influenced by 20th century history, and I keep going back to “The Story Of Art” whenever I need to take a step back and look at general ideas again. And I steal my mother’s Swedish copy! I want to read it aloud to my children, and they are only used to their father reading in German, and me in Swedish. So in order not to confuse them more than necessary in their Babylonian curse, I read it in Swedish, the stolen goods. And what a help that has been in the many museums around the world that my children have visited over the years. They recognise their “Gombrich” when they see it. Two years ago, my eldest son wants a copy - in English, in order to be able to quote from it. And of course I can’t resist buying it for him, at a shop inside the British Museum. So we have three copies, and I would not be beyond buying one in French, at a shop in the Louvre, maybe, just for the silliness of owning a favourite in so many different shapes. For they are all slightly different in layout, but equally satisfying visually and textually. I still recommend it to whoever wants a clear, concise, lovable account of the history starting with cave paintings in Lascaux, and moving forwards still, mirroring humanity in its need to express ideas, thoughts and feelings through the medium of art. My children and I will now be reading , which Gombrich wrote expressly for children, and YES - we read it in Swedish. And YES, we have it in English as well! And NO - one Billy bookshelf is not even enough for our children’s books anymore! This is The Story Of Lisa And The Story Of Art, to be continued..."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art, Ernst Hans Gombrich (1909 - 2001) The Story of Art, by E. H. Gombrich, is a survey of the history of art from ancient times to the modern era. First published in 1950 by Phaidon, the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the visual arts. The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. تاریخ نخستین خوانش (تورق): ماه سپتامبر سال 2001میلادی عنوان: تاریخ هنر؛ اثر: ارنست جان گامبریچ؛ مترجم: علی رامین؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر نی، 1379، در 674ص، مصور بخشی رنگی، نقشه، نمودار، شابک چاپ پنجم در سال 1387؛ 9789643124700؛ وازه نامه دارد، نمایه، کتابنامه از ص 639، تا ص 647؛ موضوع تاریخ هنر از نویسندگان اتریش - سده 20م فهرست مطالب: مقدمه (درباره ی هنر و هنرمندان)؛ یک- شگفتی‌های آغازین (آدمیان پیش از تاریخ و ابتدایی؛ آمریکای کهن)؛ دو- هنر در خدمت جاودانگی (مصر، بین‌النهرین، کرِت)؛ سه- بیداری بزرگ (یونان، سده های هفتم تا پنجم پیش از میلاد)؛ چهار- قلمرو زیبایی (یونان و جهان یونانی، سده ی چهارم پیش از میلاد تا سده ی اول پس از میلاد)؛ پنج- تسخیرکنندگان جهان (رومی‌ها، بوایی‌ها، یهودیان و مسیحیان، سده های اول تا چهارم میلادی)؛ شش- انشعاب بزرگ (روم و بیزانس، سده ی پنجم تا سیزدهم میلادی)؛ هفت- نگاهی به شرق (جهان اسلام و چین، سده ی دوم تا سیزدهم میلادی)؛ هشت- هنر غرب در بوته آزمایش (اروپا، سده های شش تا یازدهم میلادی)؛ نه- کلیسای مبارز (سده ی دوازدهم میلادی)؛ ده- کلیسای پیروز (سده ی سیزدهم میلادی)؛ یازده-درباریان و شهرنشینان (سده ی چهاردهم میلادی)؛ دوازده-تسخیر واقعیت (نیمه اول سده ی پانزدهم میلادی)؛ سیزده-سنت و نوآوری (نیمه دوم سده ی پانزدهم میلادی در ایتالیا)؛ چهارده-سنت و نوآوری (سده ی پانزدهم میلادی در شمال اروپا)؛ پانزده-اوج هماهنگی (توسکانی و رم، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ شانزده-نور و رنگ (ونیز و شمال ایتالیا، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ هفده-گسترش رنسانس در شمال آلپ (آلمان و هلند، اوایل سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ هجده-بحران هنر (اروپا، دوره متاخر سده ی شانزدهم میلادی)؛ نوزده-تنوع دیدگاه‌ها (اروپای کاتولیک، نیمه نخست سده ی هفدهم میلادی)؛ بیست-آینه طبیعت (هلند در سده ی هفدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و یک-قدرت و شکوه: قسمت اول (ایتالیا، نیمه دوم سده ی هفدهم و هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و دو-قدرت و شکوه: قسمت دوم (فرانسه، آلمان و اتریش، نیمه دوم سده ی هفدهم میلادی و نیمه اول سده ی هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و سه-عصر خِرَد (انگلستان و فرانسه در سده ی هجدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و چهار-گسست سنت (انگلستان، آمریکا و فرانسه، نیمه دوم سده ی هجدهم و نیمه اول سده ی نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و پنج-انقلاب پایدار (قرن نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و شش-در جستجوی معیارهای نوین (اواخر سده ی نوزدهم میلادی)؛ بیست و هفت-هنر تجربی (نیمه نخست سده ی بیستم میلادی)؛ بیست و هشت-تاریخ بی‌انتها (پیروزی مدرنیسم)؛ توضیحات مترجم؛ واژه‌نامه؛ کتاب‌شناسی؛ نمودارها و نقشه‌ها؛ نمایه تاریخ هنر گامبریچ، یکی از آثار گرانبهائی است که درباره‌ ی هنر نگاشته شده؛ مدخلی برای ورود به دنیای هنر است، از نخستین تجربهٔ هنری انسان در نقش‌ پردازی داخل غارها گرفته، تا واپسین آثار هنری امروز جهان را، به خوانشگر عرضه میکند تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 30/08/1399هجری خورشدی؛ 30/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
The Story of Art,"This work is essential reading from a great expert in Art, with a capital A. Gombrich knows how to captivate his reader and explain concretely without getting lost in detail all the artistic evolutions over the centuries and render them in their context for an uninitiated readership. If you need only one book on the history of Art, it would be this one."
The Story of Art,"This book was perfect. For someone like myself who (now) has a little knowledge of Art (the capital letter here is deliberate) and some sense of history -- but who has big gaps and oceans of ignorance about the topic -- this book was perfect. It is mature, serious, to the point, absolutely free of jargon, sure, insightful -- always interesting, never pedantic -- and not eccentric in the least. Gombrich covers all the major artists and the movements they represent, and ties them together with clarity. Like one of our most knowledgeable 'friends' on the art circuit at goodreads, he is discerning, but not judgmental. Indeed, Gombrich's account of the development of modern art - up until World War II -- is fabulous, though brief. Gombrich is much less upbeat on more recent trends -- he mentions Pop, but quite deliberately (it seems) refuses to even mention Warhol's name. I know that it's very difficult for people who know a great deal about something to recommend -- or even read - introductory books. But for anyone looking for a book of this sort, this is definitely a winner."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art is a handy little survey of art history, primarily but not exclusively western art, from cave paintings and primitive sculptures to modern architecture and pop art. It is 500 pages of text and that many pages of well synchronized color plates in a smart pocket edition by Phaidon. Twenty-eight chapters, mostly quite brief, but each a skillful, thoughtful rippling of the surface, with hints of depth and well-defined currents moving quickly and sure footedly through the eras and advances and changing perspectives on art and the role of the artist. Gombrich is more than knowledgeable and yet manages to condense without condescending or reducing his narrative to trivial choices. He brings the freshness that comes with the enthusiasm of discovery. Of course, what he is sharing is not new to him, but sharing the works and his insights with the reader is new and exciting to him, and the enthusiasm is infectious. The intended audience is younger readers than myself, high school and college age readers or adults new to art history. But I found the book not just enjoyable but helpful and insightful. Gombrich’s prose is clear and crisp, and often charming. Traveling through this great span of time with him is like taking a walk through all the great museums of the world with an elegantly minded expert at your elbow."
The Story of Art,"Gombrich's Story of Art is a great survey (western-oriented however) of art for those who wish to know the big names and get familiar with some of the more common works. He covers all the various periods in a sufficient amount of detail without sounding pedantic or academic which is a challenge when explaining art history. I would just lament the lack of information about art in China, India,. S America and of course Africa, but that is kind of how Europeans have always viewed art, isn't it. It remains nonetheless a great starter for someone who wants to get their feet wet."
The Story of Art,"I should preface everything I say with a general caveat: I am a novice in the world of art, which is the reason I picked up this book in the first place. Although I often drew as a child, I was more interested in schematic, technical drawings than anything you could call ‘art’. And, despite my keen appreciation of music and fiction, I’ve always had the visual equivalent of a ‘tin ear’. I could stand in front of a masterpiece and be more interested in what I just ate for lunch. So with that shameful admission out of the way, on to the review. In a book such as this, there are bound to be almost as many people disappointed as impressed. It’s the curse of the writer of survey books: to reduce the scope of the material down to the size of one volume, enormous omissions are inevitable. If sales alone are the to be the rubric, then Gombrich must be considered a tremendous success; nevertheless, many whose favorite paintings and sculptures were passed over without mention or comment will likely be irked. (It should also be said that his treatment of ‘primitive’ art is hopelessly uninformed and, despite his best efforts, condescending. Additionally, this book hardly touches on non-European art.) Due to my general ignorance, I was none too bothered by this. In fact, it was just what the doctor ordered. Gombrich sweeps the reader through Western history, allowing just enough time for some quick rubber-necking at the sites along the way. What you get is a brief who’s who, and the general lay of the land. Of course, anyone with an even moderate interest in art history will have to fill in the quite sizable gaps left by this method, but that’s to be expected. The only book somewhat similar to I've read is by Ian MacDonald—a song-by-song analysis and critique of the Beatles’s music. That book (highly recommended) is astounding because MacDonald’s ears are so frighteningly acute. Although I have musical training and have been listening to the Beatles since my youth, MacDonald makes you hear their music in new and exciting ways, opening up a whole new aural world. Gombrich does the same thing, but to a lesser extent, with the history of art. He has a keen eye; and, more impressive, he is able to render technical analysis into the plainest of plain prose. The reader’s mind is not burdened by the slew of art history terms that are thrown at undergraduates in introductory classes. Gombrich bypasses the linguistic apparatus and goes straight to what’s really important: the image on the canvass (or the form on the marble, etc.). So, to bring this already-too-long review to a close, read for a clear, concise, and engaging introduction to the world of visual art. It’s not one-stop shopping. But then, what book is?"
The Story of Art,"Just a dozen or so pages into this book, I knew that it was one I wish I would have had access to when I was first seriously exposed to art. While in many respects, it is a conservative textbook (being first published in 1950), it is fundamentally meant for someone who has little to no previous formal contact with art history. Of course, if you have some, this can make you seriously engage some of your previously held assumptions about what you like and why you like it, but I got the distinct impression while reading that it was meant to initiate a teenager – a teenager who very much reminded of me of myself – into a whole new world. The inclusions and exclusions of certain artists are, of course, always arbitrary. However, Gombrich’s choices do not deviate too much from a standard art history text. What particularly drew me to the book was what I perceived to be its inordinate focus on medieval and especially Renaissance art. Of the twenty-eight chapters included in the book, about five mostly focus on Western medieval images (6 and 8-11). Another six chapters (13-18) focus on the art of the Western Renaissance. Most surveys of art history to which I had been previously exposed paid scant attention to medieval art and they sometimes did not give the Renaissance the space that I felt it deserved. There is no doubt the medieval and Renaissance art Gombrich’s pet periods here (and, admittedly, they’re mine, too.) What makes it so special is that, instead of spending the first chapter in an abstract exercise of thinking about what “Art” is, he forces you over and over again to take the art on its own terms. While discussing the various visual perspectives painted by the artist of “The Garden of Nebamun,” he says: “To us reliefs and wall-paintings provide an extraordinarily vivid picture of life as it was lived in Egypt thousands of years ago. And yet, looking at them for the first time, one may find them rather bewildering. The reason is that the Egyptian painters had a very different way from ours of representing real life. Perhaps this is connected with the different purpose their paintings had to serve. What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the artists’ task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to them from any fortuitous angle” (p. 60). It is the occasional insight like this that makes the book most worthwhile for a neophyte. After all, how many of us have measured something we saw by the standards of our particular narrow time and place? He really drives home the point that thinking about art seriously means thinking about other perspectives (both literally and figuratively), other preoccupations, and other aesthetic modus operandi. This is a lesson that should be lost on none of us, about art, or about anything else."
The Story of Art,"The title of this book should be ""The Story of Western Art,"" because that is what 95% of this book is. Western Art. The ""Primitive Art,"" ""Looking Eastwards"" and ""Modernism"" section are an insult and should have been left out of the text along with his random snide comments. Othewise, this makes a nice commentary on Western Art. It's enthusiastic and reads like a ""story."""
The Story of Art,"I'm pretty torn about what rating to give this book. It is the o.g. primer on art history, so reading it gave me insight into the thought processes of some of my more old-school college professors. It also cleared up some of my shameful misconceptions around when certain artists were active (Titian 😳). The prose is very simple and engaging, and I looked forward to reading this book every day. However, I dread to imagine someone reading this in 2020 without a gargantuan grain of salt. Right off the bat, the book wildly speculates about the purposes of cave paintings (prehistoric people believed they were magic. obvs.). Any time it talks about non-Western art, the descriptions are pretty cringy. And female artists all but don't exist (I think the book names one). If there's a more contemporary art history book that is as thorough as this one, I'd love to hear about it."
The Story of Art,An excellent introduction to the history of European art. Accessible and great for building a narrative timeline.
The Story of Art,the sexual tension between this book being aggressively christian and the overuse of “gay” as an adjective 😫😩
The Story of Art,"Easy to read; makes you think of all the artists and the journey of ""Art"". English: https://elifthereader.com/books/the-s... Türkçe: https://kitaplikkedisi.com/kitaplar/s..."
The Story of Art,I’m speechless! This is one of the deepest theoretically histories of art I have read. I feel like I was walking naked in museum before reading it. Amazing book!!!
The Story of Art,"We can listen to music and appreciate it as art anytime and anywhere. I would like to be able to do the same thing with paintings. I would like to be able to look up a painting on my phone, and appreciate it anytime and anywhere. To most people, paintings are one dimensional, containing only what meets the eye. The reality of paintings is that they necessarily have enormous depth, ranging from the historical period during which they were created, what events lead to that point, the personal circumstances of the artist and the emotional and intellectual mental states of the artist during the act of painting. Paintings are snapshots of consciousness, and offer fertile ground for studying consciousness itself. I visited Rome and Florence in Italy in 2018 but failed to appreciate the grand artworks I saw there at the time. I hope I can appreciate these masterpieces more on my next visit. That being said, I did cry a little standing beneath David by Michelangelo. I didn't have the maturity to appreciate great art at the time, but David nevertheless evoked powerful emotions in me. In , Gombrich asserts that there are no wrong reasons for liking an art, but that there are wrong reasons for disliking an art. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this claim, but I think it's profound."
The Story of Art,"The story of art is also, in itself, a work of art."
The Story of Art,"I'd give it four stars if it actually discussed more than just one female artist :"")."
The Story of Art,"This is a thick and tremendously heavy book, but only physically heavy, and Gombrich is far from thick in his treatment of art down the ages. Read it lying face-down on the floor. Use it as a door-stop. The reproductions are exquisite in colour and detail, and of course it can be dipped into at leisure and as the mood takes. The Italian Renaissance is comprehensively covered. I wanted to buy this book several years ago but thought £25 was a bit steep, then found it last year on sale in Central London at half price and could no longer resist."
The Story of Art,"This well-composed book was a pleasure to read. And as far as introducing the history of art, it is exactly what I was looking for; beautiful photographs, lucid descriptions, no jargon, no pretension. I recommend that you read the short preface and first chapter, and I bet that you won’t stop there. The book’s 600 pages contain at least as many photographs, mostly of paintings, and about half of those figures are full-page (including a few fold-outs [ooh la la:]). The text is written simply – without jargon, footnotes, endnotes or appeal to authority. Mr. Gombrich’s restraint is impressive, since he obviously has a deep knowledge and personal appreciation for the topic. Instead of appealing to authority, he draws upon the art itself and universal human instincts to help the reader understand the artist and the art. For example, he explains the ancient Egyptian belief that images carry the soul, not by objectifying their primitive beliefs, but by suggesting an exercise by which the reader can discover that those feelings are commonplace within herself. He provokes (p. 40): “Suppose we take a picture of our favourite champion from today’s paper – would we enjoy taking a needle and poking out the eyes? Would we feel as indifferent about it as if we poked a hole anywhere else in the paper? I do not think so.” And so begins the dynamic struggle of emotion and reason that we follow through the history of art. This book impresses as much by its layout and editing as by the text and pictures themselves. Each of the many chapters begins with an architectural example. Since the text wisely refrains from tangents into cultural history, the architecture serves a second purpose (besides exemplifying preserved art) of adding practical context to the timeline. Then, each chapter ends with a small picture showing an artist from that time period at work. These little pictures are the only ones not actually referred to in the text, and again add non-text context, while bringing the reader closer to the artists. This approach succeeds in impressing the reader with the most important concepts in art history, since they are the ones that naturally recur throughout the story. The author frequently refers the reader to previous pictures (always giving the page number). Since the text is so brief, the reader, upon looking back at a previous picture, will also be reminded of the ideas expressed on that earlier page. Again, the author amplifies this learning effect by using consistent language and choosing pieces of art that will compliment each other. This model only breaks down in the final two chapters, which were added to later additions, about our contemporary art. The author has some worthwhile ideas about this topic, but writes too much. We can guess why this happened, and it does not detract much from the rest of the book. Finally, the backmatter contains a well-organized bibliography and timeline. As you can tell, I recommend this book. Even if, unlike myself, you already have a good knowledge of art history, I predict that you will appreciate this book. You may just read it a little faster."
The Story of Art,"The Storey of Art E. M. Gombrich I was attracted to this beautiful little book in Waterstones; its wafer thin, smooth bible pages, section of over 400 rich colour plates and stylish, minimal cover design. I was also feeling a pang of guilt for not shopping in bookshops anymore because Amazon is so easy and cheap. Walking through a bookstore, perusing books and judging them by there covers, is a real pleasure and one we will be denied access to as everybody shops online, I am pretty sure we will see high street bookshops closing down soon unless they can figure out a way to compete with Amazon. So I bought The Storey of Art mainly because it’s so attractive but I also have a staggering lack of knowledge about art history - this looked like a good way to fill myself in. I read a quote recently that said if you read one hundred books on a subject you can call yourself an expert, it’s a bit daft but I have decided set myself a challenge; read 100 art books. This one has taken me about three months to read so expertise feels like a distant dream. It took so long beacuse I wanted to concentrate and take it all in, this book covers the whole of art history from early cave painting to post-modernism, that’s a lot of useful information, also, it’s not just reading the words but taking the time to look carefully at each image and it’s not the sort of book you can read in the bath or in bed because you have to keep refering back to plates. Fortunatley it is extremely accesable, intriguiging and keenly observing making it very readable and a little pleasure to indulge in. Being so ignorant of the subject, I loved that it took its time over periods and themes, referring back to them in the following chapters, revisiting artists and styles and giving in depth critical background to works such as stylistic influences and pressures on artists of different times. It strikes a perfect balence of being informative and comprehensive without becoming stifling; it is an insightful and rich overview. I am certain that I will actually be able to remember some of this information, I couldn’t have hoped for more from art book #1/100. So maybe walking into bookshops and judging books by their covers is a good strategy after all."
The Story of Art,"The Story of Art is an incredible book, but a total sausage fest. I'm giving it 5 stars, because it narrates the history of art in an engaging, digestible, colourful, and conversational manner in a way that brings the subject matter to life for a wide audience. I was riveted, absorbed, inspired, and left with a thirst to go out into the world and learn even more about art. That doesn't mean that I believe this is a perfect book. It looks at art from a Eurocentric perspective, only discusses ONE female artist (zero in the First Edition), and retains some phrasing that will seem culturally insensitive to the modern ear. Still, this book gave me a whole new appreciation for art. Not ALL art, I hasten to add. I remain unmoved by a lot of what Modern Art has to offer, and there are only so many renditions of ""Madonna with Child"" that one can view in an afternoon before they all start to blur together. But art appreciation is certainly a skill that can be developed with increased knowledge of intent, context, purpose, and technique. Now to read The Story of Art without men..."
The Story of Art,"🖼️ 👩‍🎨 🎨 What a wonderful story, the human desire to make images of what we see and what matters to us, a desire there from the very beginnings of the human race. It’s a pity some groups, often enough religious groups, eschew representational art, or art of any kind, because in the past some of the most amazing art 🖼️ had religious themes and was created by religious persons. Or, shall we say, artists in connection with faith and spirituality. There are still some of those, but in my time I’ve heard creative art and creative writing disparaged far more than it was praised in religious circles."
The Story of Art,"This book is the best story of art ever told. I devoured the book years ago, when studying at the Art Academy. for those who are not into art, or think they are not interested in art..it will make you love it! and it will teach you from the very beginning how to see ""the mind"" of the artist in the creation.. highly recommended"
The Story of Art,"I thumbed through a much older (perhaps first) edition of this book when I was away from home and looking for something to read. I was immediately hooked by Gombrich's enthusiastic writing. When I returned home, I was extremely pleased to find that the latest edition was lavishly illustrated and updated to reflect more recent times. In my opinion, the book is fabulously readable for two reasons: Every piece of art mentioned is shown in the book beside the text and the author avoids ""pretentious jargon"". I wish every art book followed just these two principles. While the European art from the Thirteenth to Nineteenth Centuries (the bulk of the book) eventually became a slog which threatened to make my eyes glaze over, this is no fault of Gombrich. Instead, he has given me a much greater appreciation of this time period. The art is so much more interesting against a backdrop of history and biography. True to the title, the book really does read like a story. It's not just a series of mind-numbing names, place, and dates. It's a seamless narrative of art over time. So while I'm sure it was very difficult to write, the whole thing feels effortless."
The Story of Art,"It would be no exaggeration to say that this book changed my life. Before I read this I thought that most art was overpriced garbage. Especially modern art. By going through the history of art and saying how one era shaped the next and also why art is important to human development really helped me to 'get' art. Since reading this book I have taken up painting myself as well as regularly going to art galleries and museums. Having said all this, the book can be a bit dry sometimes and you can feel like you are wading through sections. If you want a book that explains art and art history then go no further."
The Story of Art,"A great book for learning and understanding art. This book was interesting to me because I worked for a time at an art gallery. I learned a lot then about art appreciation, and learned more from this book. The text is very readable and the pictures are beautiful. Great coffee table book =)"
The Story of Art,"It is one of the amazing books I have ever read. It is really comprehensive, I wish it was longer and full of more details."
The Story of Art,"This book is an essential. A book that can't miss on any shelf of an art historian, an architect or designer, and in general anyone interested, lover or influenced by Art. The Story of Art is an ambitious book, which traces the history of mankind with its artistic development, whether painting, sculpture or other plastic forms. It's a reference book rather than a reading one but it's a jewel that must have nearer you. Spanish version: Éste libro es un esencial. Un libro que no puede faltar en ninguna de las estanterías de un historiador del arte, un arquitecto o diseñador, en general, cualquier persona interesada o influenciada por el arte. La Historia del Arte es un libro ambicioso, que recorre la historia de la humanidad junto a su desarrollo artístico, ya sea pintura, escultura u otras formas plásticas. Es un libro de consulta más que de lectura pero que debes tener cerca."
The Story of Art,"For a few semesters, art history was my minor in university. I did not know a lot about art, but I was interested and it seemed fun. If only my courses were as good as this, I would not have given up on this field of study. Without being condescending or snobby (my main problem with my former teachers and some fellow students), Gombrich writes about art history in a way, that is very exciting and fascinating for the uneducated reader (i.e. me). The art prints in my edition are extremely beautiful. Definitely recommended."
The Story of Art,"Probably the best introductory text for art history and art theory that exists. Originally published in 1950, but subsequent editions (it's up to the 16th now) have been broadened to include key modern artists, works, and ideas. Clearly written and explained in Gombrich's no-nonsense style. It does stick largely to the Western art history canon, but for an introduction to the subject, it's a go-to."
The Story of Art,"It a decent introduction to art history but skips past so many greatest, especially women. Very male centric. Does talk about other places out of Europe but puts too much focus on connecting to European art instead of letting it stand as its own art. Pretty decent for beginners but far from perfect for scholars."
The Story of Art,No woman mentioned in this book. Trash
The Story of Art,"The Story Of Art A good book to pair with this reading might be - Key Moments In Art, Lee Cheshire Gombrich surveys the history of art through the ages, incorporating the successive opinions, tastes, and works of art into one continuous story. His style of writing is easy and unassuming, assisted with many beautiful illustrations of paintings, sculptures, pottery, cave art, frescoes, and icons. From the ancient era to the modern era, Gombrich explains the current theories behind why and how early humans - hunters and gatherers - drew on the walls of the caves nearby their settlement, or crafted figurines and masks. The book is considered a seminal piece of work for any aspiring art student, and as such would serve as essential reading for anyone starting a journey in the realm of understanding works of art. As a starting point, Gombrich argues that our perception of art, and consequently our love for it, is often strangled by what we see from our own vision - haemorrhaged by our constant desire for all things realistic-looking. Rather, he argues, we should be asking of a piece, ""does it work?"" in the way the artist intended. He digs down on the ancient Egyptian era of art and investigates the hieroglyphs that proliferated the walls and tombs. What we at first may see as simple, two-dimensional and amateurish pictures, is really an indication of the artist's purpose. They saw hard-grafted stories and laws of their religion, alongside a set of beliefs, being followed. One example is that an Egyptian artist was known as ""he who keeps alive"", and as part of the tomb etchings an Egyptian would draw every part of the person in likeness, as they believed that would transfer into the afterlife - any such missing limb or foot from the hieroglyph is then assumed also to transfer into the afterlife - and so it became necessary that such bodies were contorted to preserve likeness of the soul. It was an old and tried tradition until Akhenaten, a pharaoh in the New Dynasty, tried to usurp and upset this stern style as it was a change from the multiple gods to one god and the sun rays, but by Tutankhamun's time Egyptian art reverted to its time-old tradition for a thousand more years. Art was thus at this point a form of function, rather than for pleasure. The Minoans and Myceneans shared in the Egyptian art until around 400BC, when Greek art became its own character. Eventually, the Greeks challenged the usual convention of styles and began with a technique called foreshortening on pottery showing their own mythological stories, when a hidden or shortened feature of a foot or arm of the body is still concealed in the picture. This was a striking and deliberate separation from the Egyptian understanding: where the Egyptians used their knowledge, the Greeks used their eyes. He also asserts that an art ""style"" is particularly hard to define except with when it is confined to certain laws, such as the law of perspective and law of diminution of distant objects. It is with the Hellenistic era of Greece and the Empire from Alexander the Great that art develops and becomes its own. No more were works of art done for tribal magic, religion worship, or myths. They start experimenting with capturing the expressions in faces, the idea of harmonised beauty in sculpturing the likeness of human bodies, and studying the fierce emotions and movements of the body - muscle, sinew, and bone all expressed in the marble. Dramatic scenes, such as from the sculpture Laocoon by Alegsander and Polydorus, show exquisite detail and is an exemplar of the ""Greek baroque"" style of the time. With the success of Alexander across the Hellenistic Empire, that skillset was shared across the known world. Where before, rigidity prevented artists to foreshorten, now limbs were being hidden and feet were shown in portrait, which to us would seem ludicrously plain but to them it was a huge step out of the normal circle, as before, it was a step into art for its own sake. It was also from this period that the wealthy and aristocratic class began to collect works of art for pleasure, or to have works of art copied, and privately owned. It demonstrates a markedly different perception of art, from the ancient Greece of Praxiteles to the Hellenistic Greece of Alexander. After Greece it was Rome, where Rome had at first imitated Grecian statues but advanced in civil engineering feats from inspiration. In likeness to Greek columns, the Romans implemented a heirarchy of classical arches from the construction of the wedge-shaped stones. This feat established a newly spectacular form of engineering, known as vaulted roof and dome constructions. Rome had become the epicentre of civil art and its aqueducts, colosseum, roman baths, roman roads, and roman arches and domes. ""Art"" had an unusual military connotation with the Roman Empire, with military strategies, tactics, training, and strength being as though a form of pleasure in the mind and body. The Dark Ages of the Early Middle Era, he explains, is typically referred to the time when the Roman Empire fell, and therefore is listed between AD500-1000, with the High Middle Era of the medieval period thereafter between AD1000-1400, until the Age of Discovery brought the Renaissance to light. This, he does, to then talk through the various movements and styles that emerged in these Ages. As such, Gombrich details the Gothic art movement emerging from the 11th Century - or also known as Norman art - and was dispersed across the world up to the 14th Century. It appeared to convey a sense of commanding power, sturdiness, steadfastness in its buildings with hard symmetrical geometric shapes, stained high-glass windows, as well as implementing traceries and pointed arches that reminisce Roman triumphant arches. During this period, painters began to express their work as a means of capturing the important message of the gospels or of Christ. Suddenly, we start seeing dynamic movements and stories squashed in one fresco, entablature, or sculpture; we see emphases on interest being from telling a sacred story to showing nature in its likeness - people being painted in likeness being an alien technique at this time. Giotto was given by Gombrich as a first-class example, who helped to catapult the arguably slacking Italian painters and sculptors into a new paradigm of work of art, who were taking influence from Byzantine art. Then come the Renaissance period of 15th-16th Centuries, split between Early- and High-Renaissance, meaning rebirth and rediscovering that art which the ancient Romans were involved with. This was the period of extraordinary gift from Donatello, Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Raphael, Masaccio, Uccello, Francesca, Verrochio, and more. Sfumato was the new technique, an innovation of Da Vinci, that had the paintwork melting and mellowing the outlines within features of the flesh to create a naturally-flowing element, and became popular when noticed from the Mona Lisa painting. It was, however, in the merchant city of Florence where this new innovation was most intensely felt. Baroque art, the succeeding movement to the Renaissance between the 17-18th Centuries, cultivated a strong sense of ""grotesque"" or ""absurd"" techniques and visual details that had artists break away from the traditional classical and ancient Greco-Roman themes and forms. Gombrich brings the specific elements of Baroque art - the elegance, far-reaching, story-driven, emotionally-gripping, emphasis - to life by highlighting Caravaggio's work, Doubting Thomas. Baroque art is characterised by the play on light and shadow, supposedly also as a symbolic gesture of good and bad, and Caravaggio's Doubting Thomas provides a spectacular introductory spectacle of real provocation in both thought and action. Gombrich argues, and I also believe, that Caravaggio must have read the Bible again and again most vigorously to feel the essence of the spookiness, the dark macabre compared with the light salvation reality of the event, the position and posture of the scene as one looks-on as though witnessing it as one of the disciples, the shock of the protagonists, the truly grotesque nature of thrusting the finger in the side and feeling the fleshiness inside, as a point of call to faith. It was a step to exhibiting truth and sincerity, rather than harmony and beauty. All of these should incite a burst of emotion, reacting to the realness, that counteracted the Renaissance ideals of harmony and beauty of the Biblical events. As a point of understanding, Biblical works acted as more than just for the pleasure: they were situated or painted on altars, pews, on murals, on ceilings of churches, as frescoes or triglyphs; Madonnas and the Christ child were sculpted, the Nativity scene, and the Cross, all for new - and old - Christians to understand the stories in an interpreted and illustrated view rather than depending solely on the text, where failure to understand context and cross-reference might prove hard. Pope Gregory the Great once said, at the end of the sixth Century, ""Painting can do for the illiterate what writing does for those who can read"", and was instrumental in helping those against these daring portrayals of sacred beings to understand the benefits, and this line of thinking was prevalent up until the Reformation period of the 16th Century. During the time of the 1600s and 1700s, artists were experimenting with how to perfect techniques of their skills, some wanting to break away from the academic art seen as inadvertently haemorrhaging the freedom of artists to breakaway from perceived rules and laws of Art. Artists, on one hand, may have been delighted with the shift from depending on patrons who would often interfere with their intended works of art, bully them into adding or removing a detail. In saying this, however, what they delighted in losing, they dreaded in gaining another, more tyrannical ruler in nature - that is to say, the buying public, the bourgeois, the acquired taste. The common marketplace and public events were now the place aspiring artists had to go to sell their pieces, or depend on art and picture dealers. Competition now was very stiff. Competition was in fact so very stiff, that by the late 1800s a certain triumvirate of leading original artists - unbeknownst to themselves - would permanently change the world in its understanding of perceiving works of art. These artists would suffer in isolation, and endure condemnation, from the viewing public, and would never see or sniff an ounce of the successes their works would bring, that bore out of feelings of dissatisfaction with the production of art at the time, in particular to academic art. This dissatisfaction then propagated a vast array of new movements, immediately grasping attention to both public and student artist, and grew out new ideals and ways of conveying ideas on canvas. It began the era of what we now know as ""modern art"". These leaders of art, this triumvirate, was Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, and Paul Gauguin. From Van Gogh and his wholesomely bold impasto-style oil paintings provoking his own senses excitement and radically contrasting colours, Expressionism was born; from Cezanne and his determination to bridge the impressionist-style with his experimental use of small brushstrokes to form big fields of intensely bright colours, developing a craving for studying light and direct observation of landscapes, creating a collection of airy paintings, came Cubism; from Gauguin came the influence of the cloisonnist-style known as flat-faced painting, when paintings are void of particular light and shadow, and therefore it paved the way for Primitivism, a mode for recreating the aesthetic appeal of ancient antiquity paintings. One interesting point Gombrich had argued was that there is no such thing as ""Art"", in the sense of snobbery and pretentiousness that comes with an arrogant view of ""Art"", from an observer repeating fancy-sounding terminology and jargon in a museum whilst looking at a Boticelli or Van Eyck, but rather of works of art - where an artist suffers to translate their ideas on to canvas or marble until it is right to them - where we appreciate the mood and relationship between artist and canvas, irrespective of whether we like it or not: that it is rather more profitable to explore each painting in silence and understand it, than to half-know the art but act like you do. We may also be pleasantly surprised, he continues, that we might even prefer the scruffiness of a study sketch rather than a complete picture - and compares Albrecht Durer's painting of a rabbit, to Rembrandt's study of an elephant. The uncertain - perhaps somewhat ugly - scruffiness of the sketch, the excited free-flowing drawn lines capture the eye and it fills in the rest. These artists work to the point of perfection, when no other could add or change it to improve upon it. Overall, this book was a fantastic and easy read, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the works of art that have been produced throughout the ages, as one never finishes being a student of art. It is a story of the ages as told by its art and artists, favoured with extraordinary gift of persuasion and attention to detail, balancing shapes with colours and an imagination translated to canvas. His careful study of the illustrations and ensuring the reader understands his mind, the artists' mind, and what we should hopefully experience from the paintings is reassuring and humble."
The Story of Art,"I DID. I’VE FINISHED IT. Ok so it was very, very, VERY interesting. I’ve learned so much and have a now a very global comprehension of the art’s development throughout history. It’s well written and very easy to read. It’s quite a long book but it covers most of the basics in one read so it’s very much worth it. Would totally recommend"
The Story of Art,"I bought The Story of Art while about to leave Brugge, after a long week-end that was supremely friendly and quite artsy. I started reading this book as soon as I sat down in the train and was enchanted by it until the last page. 's is a masterful story of the main works and styles of art, from 30,000 BC until the 20th century. (The 16th edition includes material from up to around the late 1980s, in terms of art critique, and early 1970s, in terms of artworks.) The book is written from a Western (British) perspective but with enough mentions about Asian and African artworks to make the story global. The types of art covered here are chiefly architecture, picture, and sculpture. There are many things that I liked about this book, from its crisp analysis of artworks to the excellent rhetoric, the latter always in favor of art. The story covers mostly cave painting, ancient art, Greek and Hellenistic art, Roman and Byzantine art, Romanesque and Gothic art, Renaissance and Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo, Romanticism, and Modernism and Post-Modernism. Each style is illustrated with a selection of artworks, many of which are well-known to art beginners such as myself, all of which are discussed not only in terms of craft by also with regard to impact to the age and future art. The first artwork is usually an example of architecture, which is analyzed as a framing reference for smaller artifacts. Artworks from different ages and styles, but depicting similar topics, are compared tetually; I found very useful the detailed comparison references (e.g., ""examples of miniatures as page 211, figure 140, and page 274, figure 177""). There are numerous references to the actual quality of an artwork, which should create a very different impression from the in-book illustration; the book includes often details of the presented works, so that the reader is more easily able to understand its main characteristics. The book concludes with an analysis of art's future. I liked very much the warning that, in the 20th(-21st?) century, a real danger to art is the expectation of non-conformism---Gombrich mentions the ""tradition of the new"" of Harold Rosenberg. The book concludes with a number of additions to the 1950's first edition, and a set of useful editorial tools: an index of terms and works of art, a section of commented related work, a graphical representation of the periods and works of art covered in the main text. Among the main attractions of this book is it's deep yet understandable text. For example, I felt I could really understand the point raised by Gombrich in this paragraph: Among the things I would have liked to see improved in the book, perhaps the main element is the lack of discussion about other forms of art, from literary to performing art, from movies to computer gaming. Another rather negative point is the minimal coverage of Asian and African art, with only scant information and only some late inclusion the 20th century discovery of Greek, Chinese (Terra-Cotta Soldiers), and other artworks. I would have also been happy to see Gombrich's work continued, so that this 16th edition can take a more balanced look at Modernist and Post-Modernist art. One of the elements that turned out to be mostly negative was the detail with which the Modern and Post-Modern periods are covered. In the words of the author: Perhaps the memory of the by-stander, that is, the tendency to observe in more detail current rather than old events, motivates this over-description of material in these sections. Overall, a wonderful read for any art lover."
The Story of Art,"I decided to reread this after a twelve year gap to see if I would still be stuck with awe and wonder as I was the first time. The answer is yes. To encapsulate ""the story of art"" into one single book is an impossible task, so think of this book as ""a story of art"" written by a white man in the 1950's. He is an incredible knowledgeable and passionate man though, who is a wonderful guide for where to begin in the vast and often intimidating world of Art. Now that I have a tiny bit of footing into the art world, I enjoyed this book more, but was also increasingly acutely aware of the pitfalls of this and other such art- history books that cover large periods of time(in this case from the earliest cave art to the present day.) Having said that, what this book accomplishes is no small feat. Its no wonder this is considered such a classic. The biggest strength of this book is its use simple language, which is actually harder to do than it seems. Its easy to hide behind fancy rhetoric that often obfuscates rather than illuminates. Not a word is wasted and it all makes the most marvelous sense. Its other strength is that it does not mention any artwork in the text that it does not show in the book so the text never degenerates into a list of names that would mean nothing to one who is unacquainted with the work in question. This also leads to a very rigorous selection of artwork without crowding the book with the authors own favorites at the risk of excluding overused and familiar artworks. He states ""..it is meant for those who look for bearing in a new field, and for them the familiar appearance of apparently 'hackneyed' examples may serve as welcome landmarks."" Where it truly shines is that The story of Art teaches you how to look at art. Its like teaching a man to fish. For example, if you've ever looked at medieval art and dismissed it as crude, awkward and badly done this book will give you a pair of fresh eyes. Why was this art was being made? By whom? for whom? And to what end? These people knew how to draw(most of the time, looking at you Bayeux tapestry), but it wasn't important to the artist as long as all the symbols that were needed to get the message across were present. The idea was to communicate a message effectively and these paintings do that exceedingly well. He explains the idea through Egyptian art which we may dismiss as flat and 2-D but it was the symbolism and message of the art that mattered, there was no room for confusion. Everything had to be represented in its most characteristic angle, so the face in profile, the eye from straight ahead, as was the torso, and the limbs sideways again as they are best seen. These strict rules were followed by all Egyptian artists, they couldn't leave anything out, perhaps for magical purposes? You learn to look at art through the intentions of the artist which were often shaped by the period of history they inhabited. Because Art and Architecture are inextricably linked together there is a section in each chapter on the architectural developments of various periods which, though very brief, does round off the picture of the period really well as well as providing a great jumping off point for further inquiry. After all, most of this amazing painting and sculpture was made to be housed in actual buildings right? Also, it shows you how the ancient traditions in architecture have trickled down into modern times, there might be a piece of ancient Greek building tradition in your town! A second reading after a long gap is a richer and more enjoyable experience as I can now disagree with many of the opinions stated(oh the joys of being contrarian) since I have been exposed to alternate histories and interpretations. For example, did Titian really die of the plague at 99? apparently not. Is Giorgione's ""the tempest "" most likely just based on a Greek myth or was it more of a comment on society. Who knows, its all quite mysterious. In conclusion, anyone who has even a slight inkling towards the world of art and is looking for an accessible introduction will definitely find value in this book."
The Story of Art,"Beautiful prose and comparison of a wide variety of art movements and styles. It really does address the inter connectedness of art and how the desire to solve problems regarding light, form, depth, and emotion lead to certain movements. This book is broad in scope but a great starting reference!"
The Story of Art,"This was the great standard history of art in my school years, immensely readable, but at the time and since I have never really liked histories of such comprehensiveness. You can not write, or read, intelligently on all types of art, in all periods, all over the world with the same degree of appreciation or interest. Gombtrich's history is of course very Euro-centric and very old fashioned, in today's terms, in what is considered the 'important' areas in the history of art. But what he does write about is written intelligently and well. I am in two minds about this book, I don't really care of universal histories but if you are going to buy one then this is not bad, but how it would fare as text book today is impossible for me to say. If it gets someone in reading more, and exploring more art, of any type then it has done its job."
The Story of Art,"This was a very useful and comprehensive overview of the history of art, starting in prehistoric times and ending in the twentieth century. It is divided into 28 chapters, each which explains in detail a movement or period in art history. He covers most of the Big Names, although sometimes it feels as though he is trying to squeeze everything in. My main complaints are that it is very Western-centred and feels a little dated, and only includes ONE female artist, which feels like a massive oversight, particularly as he doesn’t even address the lack of female artists. Despite this, it’s a great book and really helped me to educate myself on a broad range of artists, periods and movements. Although it’s slightly dated, it remains a classic."
The Story of Art,"before the reveiw, a little pretext, i love art history, NPR and David Sedaris, so the fact the i read this book basically cover to cover isn't too surprising. it was clear and consise and had so many pictures (faomous and obsecure) i must have read the chapter on impressionism and post impressionism 40 times and the section and mannerism at least half that. but if your not interested, this won't read like fiction, or any kind of even remotely intersting text. to some its like reading the dictonary, but for me it was really great."
The Story of Art,"I kept expecting this book to bog down and get boring and it never did, even when it got into modern art (which I now feel like I have a better grasp of). Gombrich isn't just an art historian,he's like a psychologist, I felt like I had a better understanding of why people were making all this funky contemporary art; even if I still don't necessary like or understand it, at least I kind of feel I see where it's coming from. Really a great book if you want a basic intro to the history of art."
The Story of Art,"The classic introduction to 'Western' art, beginning with its classical origins in ancient Egypt, and casting light on the social, economic, political, cultural and technological influences from which it arose in each time and place I was fascinated from the start, and a relatively considerable proportion of Gombrich's wisdom has stayed with me. Naturally the presumption to offer a monolithic story of art is absurd - but this particular story is well worth sharing."
The Story of Art,"This is the most complete book about The History of Art. It talks about all kinds of artistic expressions and it's organized by period of time. It contains a lot of pictures of famous paintings, sculptures, buildings, of anything related to art. It was the first book I bought when I entered architecture graduation college. It helped me a lot."
The Story of Art,"Gombrich provides a comprehensive history of art from early primitive works to the end of the second world war. This book provides an overview to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for art by understanding how it has developed throughout human history. He eloquently describes works created by the great masters in a loving and cherished diction, providing a soothing and pleasurable read. There are certain periods of art history that I do not find as interesting, which caused certain chapters of books to be slower reads. That being said, the book does a great job of achieving its purpose: to provide a high level overview of the entirety of Art History for the lay reader. The book can best be summarized by Gombrich's introduction, ""People who have acquired some knowledge of art history are sometimes in danger of falling into a similar trap.. When they see a work of art they do not stay to look at it, but rather search their memory for the appropriate label. They may have heard that Rembrandt was famous for his - which is the Italian technical term for light and shade - so they nod wisely when they see a Rembrandt, mumble 'wonderful ' and wander on to the next picture. I want to be quite frank about this danger of half-knowledge and snobbery, for we are all apt to succumb to such temptations, and a book like this could increase them. I should like to help open eyes, not loosen tongues. To talk cleverly about art is not very difficult, because the words critics use have been employed in so many different contexts that they have lost all precision. But to look at a picture with fresh eyes and to venture on a voyage of discovery into it is far more difficult but also much more a rewarding task. There is no telling what one might bring home from such a journey."" (18)"
The Story of Art,"this is an example of me saying i started a book when i really didn’t, i actually read this book pretty much in the last three days as PRE pre reading (a lot of the books you’re gonna see on here from now on will be art history related) a very good introduction to art history, it is written in a clear and often almost comedic way and i really appreciate the restraint when it came to naming pieces of artwork so that the picture we were presented with as readers was as clear as possible. also it was very refreshing to have the entire history of art in one volume, it really helps to convey the progress and evolution of art as it has happened (although it feeling a little rushed towards the end with so much innovation happening in such a short period of time) excellent for an introduction to western art, however despite the odd mention of eastern art there is barely any emphasis off europe throughout the book. i wish that this was considered more, also i wish that certain female artists were included too such as hilda af klimt and artemisa. i think they would have been welcome in a book that pretty much exclusively details in the art of old white men and classical antiquity. that being said i really enjoyed reading it, particularly the section on 14th-16th century italy i found fascinating as well as the chapters on egyptian and eastern art. will be coming back to the book for short, easily digestible sections on art periods i look at more in detail in the future. would highly recommend to anyone wanting to go into anything to do with history of art."
The Story of Art,"(3.5 stars) I was very happy with this book at the start. It was easy-reading – staying conversational and not getting too in-depth with the facts. It also had a lot of photos, which is a huge plus for me. As I got deeper into the book, however, the author had to reference way too much among the previous pages to make for easy reading. In the end, I can’t say this is anything more than a good textbook for a high school or college course. I like to casually read about art, but this became more than casual in approach. Not a bad book, just not exactly what I was looking for."
The Story of Art,"Not much to say about this one. The first textbook to read when trying to learn art history. I really liked how accessible and grounded his writing is. Explains each period, movement and work in the simplest of words. Particularly helpful are the references to works mentioned in previous pages or chapters and includes page numbers for easy browsing. Wish the man lived longer and kept updating the book with new chapters for each past decade. Saying that it is highly recommended is stating the obvious. What might be helpful is reading a paper version of the book instead of an ebook version. It's very visual."
The Story of Art,"Worth it for the illustrations alone, with a good assortment of sketches, paintings, sculpture, friezes, pottery, and architecture. It's not so much an introduction to art history, as it really is the ""story"" of art. Gombrich moves chronologically, with descriptions moving quickly from one thing to next, drawing small comparisons between different movements or artists. A very broad, light overview. Useful for someone who doesn't know much about art history."
The Story of Art,"Why doesn't Goodreads allow for half-star increments in their rating system? 7/10. I wish I had read the Story of Art sooner, when it was assigned as part of my post-secondary/sixth-form curriculum. Better late than never. As the go-to 'art history book' I'm happy to have completed it, even if it took me a while to get into the swing of things. The book is dense, and it can't afford not to be so. As a result of this it's not that easy to pick up, read, and consistently return to. I'm also happy to have one of the later editions of the book, as the chapters at the end offer interesting insight into art criticism and art historians. Honestly, I found this post script more enjoyable to read than some of the other sections of the book, which maybe means that I've been reading the wrong kind of art book. Either way, happy to have finished it as it serves as a great contextual jumping-off point if I ever wanted to explore any art movement more in depth. Worth the read."
The Story of Art,"SOA is actually an art appreciation book disguised as history, which probably explains why it is so deeply loved all over the world. Gombrich spends a good 85% of his time simply talking about individual pieces. Like any good tour guide, he merely explains a few details, gets out of the way, and lets the reader savor the view. Highly recommended."
The Story of Art,"Whew! A long dense read, but very ~enlightening~ It definitely is very euro-male centric and covers the basic bases, only touching on African and Asian art in order to acknowledge their influence on Italian, Dutch, and German men. However, I was a philistine when it came to many of these entry level masters and this book covered them fastidiously. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a survey of European painting and architecture!"
The Story of Art,"Currently crawling my way out of this reading slump, doesn’t help that I chose a 1000 pg book and a Literal Textbook for my summer reads … but this book really did what it set out to do! Followed a logical (western) timeline from Egyptian art to Greek, Roman, the weiird art from the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and all the -isms that followed. Gained a lovely big picture perspective on how art has changed in subject matter, purpose, and style. Very comforting, however, to learn how we’ve always been reveling in and experimenting with art and will carry on with this pursuit."
The Story of Art,"Amazing. As an introductory book it's just perfect, Gombrich explains the beginning and major movements in Art history, in a non academic-confusing way but to the point and very insightful. He ties together all the renowned artist and by setting the context, very nicely and clear, you understand the importance of their contribution to art and society. A must have at home!"
The Story of Art,Easy read with tons of information and interesting facts. Since it covers the entire history of art it's not thaaat detailed. Loved the illustration quality.
The Story of Art,"A marvelous book. Great introduction for beginners like me. Now I can understand a lot more, the paintings, sculptures and buildings that always amazed me."
The Story of Art,"As a relative ‘newbie’ to art, it was an overall very good book and introduction into the fascinating world of art history. It was really interesting to see how art has progressed over time and the effect of religion, revolution etc on art. It highlighted to me periods which i find fascinating and others which don’t interest me as much. The only downfall to this book is the lack of female representation and small focuses on architecture as that is not why i read the book."
The Story of Art,The most beautiful “thing” I’ve ever read.
The Story of Art,"In all honesty, I should have read this book before I even entered college or changed my major from journalism to art history, but now I am a college graduate, entering a Renaissance art graduate program, and I figured I needed some concise background information, so I decided to finally read this quite excessively long book. Gombrich does an excellent job summing up ancient and medieval art— I had never learned much about it in my undergraduate courses other than from the influence of Apollo Belvedere or Venus de Milo or Laocoon & His Sons on the artwork of the Renaissance, and I appreciated how he made it readable and understandable. When I got to the Renaissance, I got a little annoyed at some of the assumptions and implications that Gombrich wrote into the book— a lot of this didn’t seem like things I had learned in the Renaissance courses I have taken. The modern chapters (after Impressionism) were where I really got tripped up— this book was originally written in 1950, and of course Gombrich had no idea at the time that some artists working before that year would eventually become world renowned (and he even acknowledges this many times in his afterword) but the way he wrote in this chapter seemed uneven and not in line with how he discussed ancient and Renaissance art— almost like he was saying “All right well I guess I have to talk about this now.” Another thing I did not care for were how Gombrich would devote tiny tiny paragraphs to an artist, in any time period, who is now quite moderately well known, would then direct you to a sample of their artwork in the back of the book (and never even their best or most famous piece of artwork) and then move on. Why even include this random interlude if it’s better for you to just give us an overview? Ultimately I really appreciated how this book tied up a lot of loose ends for me before I begin my art history graduate program; Gombrich almost seamlessly ties the entire history of art from ancient Greeks to modern times and even though everything in me thinks that this is almost impossible, well, then Gombrich achieved the impossible. There is so much more to be said about the history of art, even at an introductory level, and sometimes I personally believe that Gombrich spent too much time on the wrong things. But in the end I’m glad I read this, and if you’re thinking of studying the history of art in college, read this and John Berger’s Ways of Seeing beforehand for a good head start."

The Story of Art,A must read for every artist.
The Story of Art,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers, that this should strictly be called the story of Western art, since there is little in there that's either from outside Europe or the US, and when there is, it's normally to illustrate the past of something that was American or European. Still, up to and including the beginning of the 20th Century, it's a fascinating read, and contains a wonderful history that charts most of the major movements and gives a great overview of how different sections of western art relate to each other. As the 20th Century progresses, however, one gains the impression that Gombrich loses heart somewhat, and the last sections of the book turn into little more than a lament at the direction in which art is heading. This leads to strange exclusions from the book (Pollock is in there, and Pop Art is rapidly dismissed, but Bacon and Rothko are entirely ignored). Still, it's a book that's remained essential reading for over half a century for a good reason, and it's well worth looking into."
The Story of Art,"It’s the second time I read this book cover to cover, not counting the endless times I’ve came to it for a chapter or two. Gombrich combines an encyclopedic knowledge about Art with his unique “anti-encyclopedic” insights: all the time he calls our attention to what’s really going on, how things connect to each other, the precise aspect that’s really important - and interesting - to take away, and so in. The introduction alone is a full journey into Art. I love that he chose the word “Story” instead of “History”: it’s all about the humans behind the works, starting with the very first phrase of the book: “THERE really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.” An awesome book to read as a story, and come back to, over and over. P.S.: his “history for kids” book is also awesome!"
The Story of Art,"The kind of book where you can feel your knowledge leveling up as you read. Gombrich is an easy to understand writer with a vast chamber of knowledge. He knows exactly what to say and what to leave out. I started reading books about art history to catch up to some of my peers in visual design college and I now feel like I've gotten even more than those who had been learning art history in school for years. Gombrich knows that what we humans recognize are patterns and a story is a pattern of information. We like them so much, we even learn them for fun. He uses the story format to convey a sense of consistency throughout the things he's trying to get across and succeeds in making his readers retain that knowledge."
The Story of Art,"Nice ""introduction"" (of around 650 pages, ahem) into art history. Gombrich is anything but objective, but equally enthousiastic about almost everything. It's a shame this book is too old to thoroughly incorporate art after 1950, and honestly it was hell to get through at the pace my course required, but I do feel like I've refreshed my knowledge and learned quite a few new things."
The Story of Art,"I read this when I studied History of Art, and loved it. I still love it to this day. It's accessible, non-pretentious, and examines art in a fascinating, revealing way. If you're studying the subject or simply love art, you'll definitely want to read this."
The Story of Art,"An amazing book. Funny how 600 pages can teach you how much there is to explore. With this book, I feel like I've only now just approached the surface so that I'll be able to scratch it if I pursue the subject further. Highly recommend—you will see the world differently."
The Story of Art,"Whose story? Who gets to tell it & for whom? Hard to read this and not be aware of its severe flaws, biases and limitations. Should come with massive disclaimers for those who’re inclined to read uncritically and take books at face value."
The Story of Art,HARMONY BALANCE NATURE
The Story of Art,"Lovely read for an art history beginner (me!). So accessible, I didn't feel intimidated by the material at all."
The Story of Art,where is the female artists?
The Story of Art,"I have heard of this book for some time but was always intimidated by its volume. At the start of this year, when I was strolling around in Cambridge, a place with lots of dear memory, I found a second-hand version of this book, with a flyer for a Degas exhibition inside. Opening the book that night at the hotel, the scent of old books struck me and I immediately indulged in the book. Five stars would be too few for this book. I wish I had started this book sooner - even before I knew this book. I wish I had read this in my early year of high school. It might have changed my life forever. Well, I think it has certainly changed me a lot during these several months. History is not my thing - I changed high school because I wouldn't need to study history in my new school. I have always found history dull and historians' fixation on years and meaning boring. However, this book on art history is educating and beautiful at the same time. I have rarely come across books and articles with such language as clear flowing water while stating the points clearly. The style of the language is a little bit old-school, which is a good thing in my view. Nowadays authors are no longer writing in such a modest but graceful way. I was touched deeply several times in my read. It wasn't because I was made sad, it was purely touching. The words and the images just stirred my emotion somehow. It was simply the power of art, I think. “There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists - men and women, that is, who are favoured with the wonderful fit of balancing shapes and colours till they are ‘right’, and, rarer still, who possess that integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forgo all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work. Artists, we trust, will always be born. But whether there will also be art depends to no small extent on ourselves, their public.” I came to tears when I read this. So many thoughts and memory came into my mind. I recall the time when I was happily doodling with my crayons, when my grandfather drew the scene of his childhood memory when we had projects about different art styles, when my art teachers patiently guided me through the steps of calligraphy arts, when I first came to the UK and visit the National Gallery with my friends… I wish I have more encounters with arts, I wish I had started sooner, but it’s never too late to start appreciating and reflecting. By talking about Art in such an engaging way, this book is a piece of art itself. Getting close to the end of the book, a rush of sadness came into me, and I couldn’t wait to read it again and again."
The Story of Art,"Just got through the last 4 chapters of the book and found myself so into it. I had never known that history book can be as captivating as this one. The narrative style is great, which helps to make sense of all the ambiguous events and movements in the history of art. I would give Sir Gombrich 5 stars for his talent of clarify things. This book is a helpful resource of radical explanations and supportive examples which helps me to strenthen my arguments on my crtitical analysis. It aims at answering my greatest concern toward the history of art: ""In which standard we define art ?"" All the examples were refered to this book. .. Inspecting the history of art from the nineteenth century, I am coming up with a very basic question: ""In which standard we define art ? Or is there a standard or a necessity to form ?"". As most art debates has no end and a question always provokes an infinite sequence of many other ones, I failed to determine a yes or no answer after the research but found it able to present several arguments. In the earlier period of time, the art standard was mainly set by artworks showing supreme skills of from leading masters, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Ruben, Goya,.. As there was an inevitable agreement on the level of excellence in their artworks, the definition of art at that time was concrete to define. However, the perception of art had changed so far that artistic expertise had no longer been judged merely by the objective supreme painting skills but by subjective approach. While the old school art theory presents an objective standard with definition of line, form, shape, color to define art value, the new school states that art is wholly subjective which determine a mean to expressing individuality. By this theory, artwork is evaluated through its capacity to impact viewer emotionally, psychologically, physically and spiritually. Though each school of thoughts present its drawback, does what matters just which school of thought that we choose to embrace ? The old school criticism prompts people to categorize art as orthodox art vs unorthodox art, low art vs high art, art vs non-art etc. It is needless to indicate the obsoleteness of the old-school objective criticism, which was confirmed in every period of the art development. The first reason is that most artists in every period had the great tendency to break the tradition. For instance,I take an insignificant but particular example of Edouard Manet (1832- 1883), one of the avant-garde who started the art revolution in French. By examining the traditional convention in painting of his time, he discovered that the whole claim of it was wholly based on misconception of shade and light, which made the representation of object in traditional art at that time very artificial. That said, the emergence of all art movements were fostered by the courage of artists to fearlessly examine the traditional convention, the quarrel they endured with the preceding masters and the desire of escaping from the deadlock that they found themselves in. Therefore, using objective convention from tradition to measure art can be improper. The second reason is that any definition on which we rely to evaluate art have been disparate through time. For instance, even the most successful art movement, French Impressionism was substantially rejected by not only critics but all section of public in its beginning. Impressionist’s painting was once thought to be mad and unorthodox because the viewers claimed they saw nothing in those paintings except a confusion of brushstroke. For a century later, since we extol Impressionism as the legend for innovation in art that moved art away from the precise imitation of reality to the representation of what we really see things, it is hard for us to understand why Impressionist had met such rejection at that period. But it is a considerable example for how definition of orthodox art differs over different period of time. Since, it is unavoidable to state every objective standard formed will soon be replaced by another one. On the other hand, the subjective approach to art criticism results in the likeliness to mislead the evaluation of art. There are many modern artworks which are personally hard to understand. They are, for example, the Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings of dripping paint, the Black Square(1915) by Malevich or the Fountain of Marcel Duchamp(1917). Since I am clueless to find the level of supreme skills in the creation of these works labelled as art, I find the necessity to rely on the new school of thought to define the artistic value in those works. However, owing to the subjectivity, it is likely to use the new school of thought as an excuse for poor artistic skill and an exhaustion of creativity. Hence there is a tendency that the art value is exaggerated by critics, while the artists’ attempt might only is to shock the public and stand out. Since there is no concrete standard to judge, the art evaluation leaves a huge gap of ambiguity. Art is both unnecessary and unable to be standardized The perception to art considerably fluctuates. Gombrich stated that artists only mission is to create things, which had never existed before. That explains why artist always struggle to break the tradition, seek for new problem and solution for unsolved issue. I take Paul Cezanne as an example. As the current Impressionism had gained a complete triumph in making a conquest of nature, Cezanne decided that there would be no gain to pursue that movement further; then he tried to start everything from scratch again, seeked for new problems and struggled to solved it. Thanks to his endeavour, new possibilities in art had been explored which fostered the new art movement in the early 20th century. That said, it is impossible to standardize art. Due to the perpetual finding of new problems to solve, artists always dissatisfied with the current standard. Since Cezanne felt the loss of the sense of order and balance; Van Gogh felt art lost the sense of intensity and passion; Gauguin dissatisfied with current life and art; their struggle to find solution urge to the start of three new movements, respectively Cubism, Expressionism and Primitivism. Gombrich also indicated that the modern art we see today mostly grew out from the feelings of dissatisfaction that is just mentioned. Once again, the art history proved the unnecessity of such art standard as well as the impossibility to form an art definition because every standard established will be soon intentionally challenged and altered. “ Art history is a weaving and changing of tradition, in which each works refer to the past and point to the future.” There is no such thing as art. There are only people willing to undergo the long run of finding solution for new coming problems who are labelled as artists (Gombrich, 2006). And then what makes their works differentiated is how long their value remained to be praised through time. The continual emergence of new perception in art is a great stimulation for the new possibilities."
The Story of Art,"Enjoy it for What It Is... I was recommended this book as somebody who knew nothing about art. And I struggle to imagine a better presented introduction to this vast topic. The author states in the fifteenth edition preface ‘In writing [this book] I thought first and foremost of readers… who had just discovered the world of art for themselves.’ And I felt he guided me through the labyrinth in a straight line. The book presents a chronological story. ‘The story’ begins with some of the earliest known examples of cave images. It continues through ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and China before continuing its predominant focus on Europe until reaching the present day. It touches on the influence of art on these societies and the influence of these societies on art. Methods and trends are also touched on. And on occasion it links generations of artists’ stories together such as Leonardo to Michelangelo to Raphael. It contains illustrations throughout. These illustrations are referred to by the text. I think criticisms of this book come when one takes it out of context. Any criticism I have heard, always from a connoisseur, can be summarized in one sentence: A more accurate title would be ‘A Story of Predominately Western Art’. However, if this book is taken as the author intended it to be, one will struggle to find any book that better achieves such an ambitious intention."
The Story of Art,"It is a pleasure to read story of art -some part of it as the focus is European art - as a continuous weaving of many creators, disobedient minds , sometimes heretics and changers of traditions , challenging the past with dissatisfaction and pointing the future with an inevitable end to be challenged as a past chapter of the story. It is still provocative after many years , although it may be classified as an introductory book , for thoughts about the question of what art is or whether there is something called art or there is just artist as Gombrich wrote at the introduction of the book . Then the questions : all this is about what ? Mimesis, expression , kind of construction of another realm , just something new ? It is good to have these questions in mind while going through the centuries behind the stories of many artists looking for ways to create , express, challenge. Probably the pleasure was endorsed as I read the copy from 1950 , third edition which has been at my library for last 30 years waiting to be read. As art is a shelter against the dismay, these Pandemic days was probably time to read it."
The Story of Art,"The story of art told as the story of a continuous weaving and changing of traditions in which each work refers to the past and points to the future... Starting from prehistoric and primitive peoples and finishing with the 20th century, Gombrich takes you through a journey which shows how interestingly a living chain of tradition links the art of our own days with that of the Pyramid age. For there seems to be no such thing as art, but there are artists who 'possess the integrity of character which never rests content with half-solutions but is ready to forego all easy effects, all superficial success for the toil and agony of sincere work'. - 700 pages, with pictures taking 50% of it. - Definitely the world's best selling art book as of today. - Definitely must-read if you have ever felt lost in a museum."
The Story of Art,"I've read it with the enthusiasm of a child that has a great new toy and is eager to test it in all the possible ways. I started looking at buildings with different eyes. I started analyzing all the museums I've been to and all the paintings I've seen. I was calling my friends in the middle of the night to ask them if they knew something I read and seemed so logical and yet we haven't thought about it. This book is amazing for people who desire a brief introduction into Arts and need something to start with. What I missed (and even the author has a long ""disclaimer"" about it) was more info and appreciation on Contemporary Art. I understand why it is difficult to write about something happening now and I understand there are a large number of artists to pick from. But nevertheless I felt Gombrich does not really appreciate Contemporary Art. I was disappointed about his presentation on Surrealism but as I kept reading I understood his point of view. That being said, the book is a fantastic introduction into visual arts up to Surrealism. After that point everything is open for debate :)"
The Story of Art,"- Understanding the history of art as an evolution process, overcoming the predecessors as the bieggest challenge in the scene. - The book allows you to identify the 'differences' between the previous masters and the newer talents, and it provides period-specific information that helps you understand why each piece was so revolutionary for its time. - When art(ists) freed themselves of clients, the market appeared. - A collection of forewords provided at the beginning of the Korean edition (2017, Yekyong) does tell you that time flies. Yet so many shared aspects and viewpoints from the 1950s and the present world."
The Story of Art,"Extraordinary. And exceedingly good book, circumventing the jargon and pompousness of art historians, it illustrates the history - and story - of art in a most down-to-earth manner, clearly and concisely. For the uneducated reader as myself, it was an unparalleled reading. I guess the most striking element is Prof. Gombrich's ascetic take, to only mention and explore works of art contained in the book, discerning with clarity their composition, which techniques were employed in their creation, and above all, how their story interlaced, what changes came with the years, the problems of each generation, the composers and artists who tackled them - who succeeded, and why."
The Story of Art,"A very precious book to deal with and a very intellectual writer. Gombrich has a very classic and smooth style of writing about Art. He summarized the history of art from the ancient era into contemporary in 27 chapters. Followed by a chapter that revealed his approach towards visual art. The writer picked some of the most distinguished paintings in each era, which crystalized the main figures and approach of drawings then. The book is writing in a first person narrator as a story to be retold unlike the documentaries books. Moreover, it has a plenty of visual art and paintings revealing the schools of art followed by a detailed timeline and a map to follow the era were discussed in the book. I enjoyed keeping it as a reference."
The Story of Art,"I have started this book with very basic knowledge of art per se, and after finishing it I still do have a very basic knowledge of it. I don't see the objective of this book as teaching you Art, but teaching how Art had to change and evolve to overtake obstacles and challenges of every century. Most importantly is an amazing guide on how to look at art in order to understand it more deeply if you would like to go further in your personal study."
The Story of Art,"There's a lot to love here, like Gombrich's formidable intellect, deep learning and sensitivity combined. He can make you see shop worn works such as Mona Lisa and Rafael's Madonnas with new eyes, and help you see why they were important and continue to be great works of art. But the book was first written in the 50's, and it shows."
The Story of Art,Amazing book for everybody who's eager to read about the artists journey through the ages. The content isn't too detailed with overwhelming facts so it's very much convenient for people who has little knowledge about art or architecture. The book author takes the advantage to show us many unfamiliar works and places.
The Story of Art,"Read this for uni — well and understandably written, was easy to follow his thoughts and ideas. Now I know more about art and architecture. More specifically about art, he could’ve written more about architecture, though."
The Story of Art,"So glad I got the physical version after trying to read this on the kindle. Beautiful art, including fold outs, with interesting anecdotes and explanations of stylistic choices. Reading about architecture might be one of the worst things of all time tho... Anyways glad I finally finished this and I'm super excited that galleries are opening up again! (We have art lest we perish from the truth)"
The Story of Art,"A very enjoyable overview of art history by a master in story-telling. Although euro-centric in most parts, Gombrich's approach tries to keep an eye in what's going worldwide. His style is accessible but still far from dull."
The Story of Art,Great introductory text to Western art history
The Story of Art,Read about art in the Middle Ages pages 185-245. Very nice pictures and explanations of the development of artistic styles. Easy to understand.
The Story of Art,"The pace very well developed, definetly well written so really satisfying and the cinematography certainly stannig and so very very satisfying."
The Story of Art,Great one to get for friends who “want to know more about art”.
The Story of Art,Excellent books about Art history. This is the only book you need for researching.
The Story of Art,It’s not really a story of global art but a story of Western Art.
The Story of Art,Essential
The Story of Art,"Fabulous journey of (mostly Western) Art explained in great detail. Definitely recommend the bigger paperback or the hardcover and not the pocket version, given the amount of content!"
The Story of Art,"Not sure which will be the greater achievement this year between finishing this and finishing medschool. Anyway, good intro into the world of art!"
The Story of Art,"What a tremendous resource for learning about art - and instantly an all-time favorite book of mine. The narration is engaging and accessible, and the setup of this edition (with text in front and illustrations arranged in back) made it easy to follow along and study each exhibit. I gained a real appreciation for the overall ’story of art’ - the themes at play and problems and solutions faced by and encountered by art in various historical and social contexts - as well as fantastic introductions to many significant artists. The original book was published shortly after WW2, and since then Gombrich added several additional intro and conclusion sections in subsequent editions, which can be found here and serve as nice time capsules. The central takeaways of this book for me are 1) there is no art without artists 2) the story of art is a nonlinear one without any defined endpoint, with plenty of zigs and zags, as solutions are devised to solve problems which then open up new problems 3) art requires some societal/historical motivational core (the grain at the center of a pearl) to thrive. * Primitive art - drawing faces from individual shapes; evolution from there to new types of art was not about advances in technology, but changes in ideas (of what should be depicted and how) * Egypt - particular style of painting, everything follows set laws (depicting human body parts in different ways / planes based on how they were best conveyed rather than how they appeared) - little evolution over time (until Tut, new ways of depicting); sacred purpose of portraits in tombs. Painting from knowledge. * Greek revolution: bursts of creativity, adherence to Egyptian technique combined with freedom to deviate from sacred rules on human form; beginnings of foreshortening; Athenian democracy ~ evolving identity of artists; paintings / statues alongside poems and plays as things to discuss. Portraits evolved later in Greek era - sculptures of Alexander. * Hellenistic art - Greek civilization spread via Alexander, into ‘Hellenistic’ world. Art became intentionally more impressive (Corinthian columns evolving from Doric/Ionic). Rich people collecting art made artists more important; prevalence of art in Pompeii (an otherwise ordinary provincial town in Hellenic world) illustrates this evolution * Rome - borrowing things they liked from Greece; triumphal arches / columns (influenced sacred depictions in Jewish, Indian art) * Religion and art - what can / should be depicted? Pope Gregory - art educates the illiterate and has important purpose * Major significance of Byzantine art - images as holy, maintained old eastern / Egyptian traditions and fused to religious art - preserved traditions for later eras, provided bridge to Renaissance * Middle ages / dark ages * Local tribal art fused with Christianity * Egyptians painted what they knew; Greeks what they saw; Middle Ages what they felt (religious depictions convey this). Middle Ages survival bias - religious art lasted, privately owned art destroyed * Evolution of Norman / Romanesque architecture styles. Gothic - extension of Romanesque, greater use of arches, expanding into stained glass. Gothic art - methods of art as means to end, of telling sacred stories better * Giotto (Florence 13th century) - begins era of artist as part of history of art; first artist to harness Hellenistic technique preserved by Byzantines, add creativity, and transform Gothic lifelike sculpture into painting * International style (14th century) - Italian (kept Byzantine art alive) and French ideas spread across Europe; depicting nature became important -> depicting humans accurately -> renewal of classical styles * Renaissance - key pillars: 1) scientific / mathematical perspective 2) close observation of nature / understanding of human anatomy 3) learning from antiquity / classical forms of sculpture, architecture, art * Early Renaissance pioneers: Brunelleschi, Donatello (architecture, sculpture) * Northern vs Southern Renaissance: Italian art began with scientific perspective / outlines / understanding of body; Dutch added detail upon detail to resemble reality (van Eyck - oil painting) * High Renaissance in Florence / Rome - changing status of artist, determination to be more than craftsman, equal with scholar or poet. Leonardo - use of science to elevate painting above humble art; sfumato technique - blurring of outlines + mellow colors allowing merging of forms, leaving more to viewer’s imagination. Michelangelo - papal commissions, extended Leonardo’s focus on human body and emphasized this exclusively, accurate painting of form. Raphael - ‘idea of beauty’, simplicity of Madonnas, fluidity of bodies in motion. * Venice - Titian, expert handling of paint - allowed to break rules of composition (position of virgin etc) and make up for it with colors. Bellini, Correggio - use of color and light to balance forms. Importance of color in Venice, influenced by eastern linkages. * Spread into north. Durer - studied in southern Europe and traveled to Venice as artist; combined northern (earlier Gothic) style (nature, extreme detail) with Italian Renaissance ideals of beauty - to tell sacred stories. Bosch - synthesis of old (primal fears, depictions of evil) with new (methods of portraying) * Later Renaissance - crises of art in 16th century; idea that art had reached perfection in Renaissance, so what to do next? * Mannerism (imitation of Michelangelo), Parmigiano, Cellini - quest for unusual / interesting even at expense of natural beauty (modern) * Southern art: Tintoretto - legacy of Titian painting, fused with mystery - feel thrill and tension of drama (St Mark’s remains, St George / dragon). El Greco - Spanish mysticism, also realist portraiture * Reformation challenges in north - outlawing of religious imagery removed major market for art. Great artists left for England - Holbein the Younger - portraits of masterly restraint painted at Henry VIII court. Dutch art survived Reformation best - genre paintings, follies of everyday life - Bruegel the Elder * 17th century: Baroque / neoclassical art, following from Greco / Tintoretto (complicated compositions, showcasing light and color) * Rome: schools of Caracci v Caravaggio. Caracci - classical scenes, beauty, inspiration by Raphael - development of neoclassical style (influenced Reni, Poussin, Lorrain - who influenced later landscape painters). Caravaggio - naturalism, faithful looks at nature, truth over beauty - unafraid to paint ugliness of reality. * Rubens - synthesis of Caracci (classical scenes) with Caravaggio (naturalism) and Flemish/Dutch tradition (not focused on standards of beauty, attention to detail). Ability to make scenes (large scale or portraits) come to life in ‘painterly’ way. * Artists influenced by Rubens. Van Dyck - painter at court of Charles I, elegant portraits of royals. Velásquez - court of Philip IV in Spain, learned from Italy - inspired initially by Caravaggio, then by Rubens and Titian; forerunner of Impressionism, capturing real moments (Las Meninas) * Protestant Northern Europe: changing marketplace post-Reformation; commission practice ending, so artists had to sell art to public, leading to greater specialization. Growing embrace of idea of ‘picturesque’ landscapes. Rembrandt - etchings, inspired by Caravaggio; self portraits, portraits - sense of being face to face with real people, illustrating depth of souls, displaying ability to understand all types of men; light and shade used to enhance scene’s drama. Still lifes - subject became incidental to importance of painting. Vermeer, still lifes with people - unique contrast of mellowness / precision * 18th century: peak of Baroque art/architecture around 1700 * Versailles as epitome of baroque styling (without baroque approach would be monotonous); boom in similar palaces and monasteries around Europe. Decline in importance of individual arts - art focused on building these grand spaces. * England. St Paul’s - baroque or not? Restrained, Italian Renaissance styling, church as place for contemplation not otherworldly vision. Country house > palace; classical stylings that don’t break rules; legacy of Claude Lorrain. Hogarth - moral tales in engravings. Reynolds (founded Royal Academy) vs Gainsborough; parallel to Caracci/Caravaggio. Reynolds - favored imitation of Italian Renaissance masters (similar thinking to Caracci), elevation of painting as intellectual pursuit, importance of painter’s ideas; paintings sometimes a bit labored. Gainsborough - simplicity, nature as teacher, straightforward portraits emphasizing good brushwork, and landscapes. * New directions around French Revolution: growing collector taste for novelty; shift from old ways of teaching to academies (created new crises of lack of interest in new art vs old, and unsubtle works at academy shows); embrace of older styles (Classical Greek, Gothic) in favor of baroque / rococo / neoclassical architecture in US. * Portrayal of recent history and heroic figures with lessons for present - Copley, Jacques-Louis David. Goya - portraits in style of old masters (Van Dyck ) with artistic skill of Titian, but new eyes and lack of flattery. Romantic poetry spilling into painting - painting from inner vision, Goya and Blake. * Popularity of landscapes - 2 camps in England. Turner - obsessed with improving on traditions (Claude Lorrain) - motion and complexity, human emotion reflected in nature. Constable - no need for trickery, honest simplicity best - don’t outshine nature. * 19th century: industrial revolution, mass production, decline in public taste - conflict between artists and public, split between artists doing ‘official’ work and those outside mainstream. Paris as center of art world. * France: Ingres (conservative painter following David, technical smooth perfection) vs Delacroix (movement, excitement of a scene). Corot as a bridge in approaches: capture truth in general forms / tones - achievements of palette (use of colors harmonized with gradation of tone). Barbizon school - following Constable, seeing nature with fresh eyes; Millet - landscape approach taken to figures; Courbet - realism a la Caravaggio. Rossetti, pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, truth over beauty - artistic dead end? * Impressionism - beginning of idea of art as studying/solving particular problems. Manet - revolution in depicting colors; classical masters of color as inspiration (Titian, Velásquez, Goya); illusion of depth via simple flat forms. Monet - painting in front of motif rather than studio; technological changes e.g rapid strokes and no time to mix paints, effect of whole over specific details. Renoir - inspired by crowd scenes (following Jan Steen), but shifted focus onto effect of light. Degas - ballet, unexpected angles used to study space / forms; objective / dispassionate (interest in movement / space, not in beauty of subject). Rodin - unfinished looking works. Contributing factors to development of Impressionism: 1) photography (art needed to evolve new aims) 2) Japanese woodblock prints becoming prevalent and introducing new ideas of perspective / completeness. Ideas around Impressionism - ideas of finishedness (borrowed from Rembrandt - artist’s right to declare when finished); overcoming knowledge of form as obstacle to enjoyment. * Late 19th century: triumph of Impressionism, what next? 3 post impressionist masters - dissatisfied in different ways, led to new traditions of modern art. Shared willingness to sacrifice correctness of outlines to accomplish different aims. None of these artists were well-known/understood in their times. * Cezanne - felt order/balance lost in Impressionist messiness; sought reconciliation of methods of Impressionism (paint what one saw) with balance/harmony (‘paint Poussin from nature’); influenced Cubism * Van Gogh - felt intensity / passion of art was lost in focus on visual impression. Brushstrokes to convey artist’s excitement (flamelike strokes); influenced Expressionism * Gauguin - dissatisfied generally with life and art, aimed for simplicity through exploration of native culture; influenced Primitivism * Modern art. Influence of architecture - Bauhaus, functionalism. Extension of ideas of what painter should paint - paint what he sees? We can’t separate what we see from what we know. * Expressionism - painting of feelings, Munch’s scream; focus not just on pleasant things. Abstract art - Kandinsky first to paint without recognizable object. * Fauvism - Matisse, 1900s Paris. Decorative simplification, use of colors. Cubism, Picasso - problems of form; one solution to essential tension in art (depth on surface), experiments in modeling; recognizable objects, pictures made of uniform parts so whole looks consistent in spite of unfamiliarity. Return to Egyptian principles of painting from knowledge of objects. Klee - new possibilities of forms, nature creates through artist; artist creates something new rather than replicating reality. * Primitivism - lasting effects of Gauguin, theme that influenced much later art - quest for native/childlike simplicity - Rousseau, Chagall, Wood. Surrealism - Freudian inspiration, dreamscapes; Magritte (self portrait of artist creating new reality), Dali. Pollock, start of AbEx - unifying two strands 1) childlike simplicity / spontaneity 2) sophisticated interest in problems of painting * What drives art? Core task set by community / society; always new challenges to pursue even as art evolved, new solutions led to new challenges. Modern art - prevalence of old/new theories provide core impetus for art’s evolution."
